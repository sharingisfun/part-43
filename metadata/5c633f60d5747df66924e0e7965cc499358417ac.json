ESI\nGroup.s suite of simulation products offers unique\ncapabilities to simulate\nmultiphysics, multiscale, fluid, thermal, chemical,\nbiological, electrical,\nand mechanical phenomena.\n\nESI Group has in-depth expertise in performing consulting\nand research and\ndevelopment projects in CFD for aeronautics, automotive,\nFuel cells,\nSemiconductors etc. Relying on this strong engineering\nknowledge, ESI Group\nand its network of subsidiaries provide advanced consulting\nservices\nworldwide. For each project a team of highly skilled\nengineers will set up\na full process to better analyze customer needs and offer\nthe optimum solution\naccording to the specified requirements.\n\nCFD has become an important component of the current CAE\ncommunity. CFD saves\ntime and money by running .what-if. scenarios on the\ncomputer which used to\ncost much more when done with physical prototypes. The CFD\nproducts,\nsolutions and services offered by ESI Group enables\nengineers to gain insight\nabout their projects from conception to completion thus\nmaking it the ideal\nchoice for real world simulation solutions.\n\nI N S T A L L\n\n1) Unpack and install.\n2) Seee Linezer0.txt\n3) Enjoy this release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c633f60d5747df66924e0e7965cc499358417ac","amp;dn":"ESI.CFD.Suite.v2010.0-Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c633f60d5747df66924e0e7965cc499358417ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,99,63,96,213,116,125,246,105,36,224,231,150,92,196,153,53,132,23,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
