As Henry         \n    VIII's stunning maps of the British coastline from a     \n    bird's eye view show, they were also used to exert        \n    control over the world.                                    \n                                                              \n    During the Enlightenment, the great French Cassini       \n    dynasty pioneered the western quest to map the world      \n    with greater scientific accuracy, leading also to the      \n    British Ordnance Survey. But these new scientific         \n    methods were challenged by cultures with alternative     \n    ways of mapping, such as in a Polynesian navigator's      \n    map which has no use for north, south and east.            \n                                                              \n    As scientifically accurate map-making became a powerful  \n    tool of European expansion, the British carved the        \n    state of Iraq out of the Middle East. When the British     \n    drew up Iraq's boundaries, they had devastating           \n    consequences for the nomadic tribes of Mesopotamia.      \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0c7c62422df1207c5cd2207bd75f2ee77e5c303","amp;dn":"Maps.Power.Plunder.and.Possession.S01E01.720p.HDTV.x264-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0c7c62422df1207c5cd2207bd75f2ee77e5c303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,199,198,36,34,223,18,7,197,205,34,7,189,117,242,238,119,229,195,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
