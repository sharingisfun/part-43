It is based on the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade. Because of its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, the movie was extremely controversial upon its release, and remains banned in several countries to this day. It was Pasolini's last film; he was murdered shortly before SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² was released.\n\nThe film focuses on four wealthy, corrupted fascist libertines in Benito Mussolini's Italy in 1944 who kidnap a total of eighteen teenage boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, sexual and mental torture. The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality, and fascism.\n\nAlthough it remains a controversial film to this day, it has been praised by various film historians and critics, and while not typically considered a horror film, SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² was named the 65th scariest film ever made by the Chicago Film Critics Association in 2006 and is the subject of an article in The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986).\n\nThere are torrents of this film all over the web, but none of them seem to include this material.\n\nSalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²: Yesterday and Today, a 33-minute documentary featuring interviews with director Pier Paolo Pasolini, actor-filmmaker Jean-Claude Biette, and Pasolini friend Nineto Davoli\n\nFade to Black, a 23-minute documentary featuring directors Bernardo Bertolucci, Catherine Breillat, and John Maybury, as well as scholar David Forgacs\n\nThe End of SalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â² a 40-minute documentary about the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production\n\nInterview with set designer Dante Ferretti \n\nInterview with  director and film scholar Jean-Pierre Gorin\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1569441b3e1dee1d68e17f23f8d3ff79cc01b32","amp;dn":"Pasolini%5C%27s+SALO+Documentaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1569441b3e1dee1d68e17f23f8d3ff79cc01b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,86,148,65,179,225,222,225,214,142,23,242,63,141,63,247,156,192,27,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
