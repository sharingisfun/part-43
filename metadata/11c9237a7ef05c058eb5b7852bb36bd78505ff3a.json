Each of these worlds is broken into different areas in which the player must manoeuvre a mysterious crystal sphere by using realistic physics to advance. There are no enemies, no bosses and no violence in NightSky. An intuitive experience, NightSky is friendly for casual and mainstream gamers alike. It also offers a formidable challenge for hardcore players, with an unlockable Master mode. The original soundtrack by experimental jazz musician, Chris Schlarb will further heighten the surreal experience. \n\n\n================\nCLOSING COMMENTS\n================\nNightSky is a nice place to visit. The physics-based gameplay is clever, but the real draws are the beautiful scenery and the ambient electronic soundtrack. It's recognizable at a glance, which isn't something that can be said for every game.\n\n================================================================================\n\n==========================\nIGN RATINGS FOR &quot;NightSky&quot;\n==========================\n\n8.5 Out of 10 For Presentation\n\n8.5 Out of 10 For Graphics\n\n9.0 Out of 10 For Sound\n\n7.5 Out of 10 For Gameplay\n\n6.5 Out of 10 For Lasting Appeal\n\n7.5 Out of 10 OVERALL\n\nFOR NightSky Review GoTo : http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1142949p1.html\n\n==================================================================================\n==================================================================================\n                    Please Leave Comments &amp; SEED if you can\n==================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c9237a7ef05c058eb5b7852bb36bd78505ff3a","amp;dn":"NightSky-DEMONSons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c9237a7ef05c058eb5b7852bb36bd78505ff3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,201,35,122,126,240,92,5,142,181,183,133,43,179,107,215,133,5,255,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
