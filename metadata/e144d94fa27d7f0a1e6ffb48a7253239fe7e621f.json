It is unusual in the singer-songwriter's catalog in that none of its songs was written by Griffith. Here she pays homage to other songwriters who have influenced her own career by covering their songs. Guest artists who appear in their own compositions include Frank Christian playing guitar on &quot;Three Flights Up,&quot; Bob Dylan playing harmonica on &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather,&quot; Arlo Guthrie in a duet on &quot;Tecumseh Valley&quot; and John Prine lending harmony vocals on &quot;Speed of the Sound of Loneliness.&quot;\n\nThe album rose into the #54 position on the Billboard Pop Albums chart in 1993, although it had no charting singles.\n\nReleased March 2, 1993 (US) \nRecorded Nashville, Tennessee, Dublin, Ireland, and Los Angeles, California \nGenre Country, Folk \nLength 1:02:08 \nLabel Elektra Records \nProducer Jim Rooney \n\n&quot;Across the Great Divide&quot; [with Emmylou Harris] (Kate Wolf) - 3:57 \n&quot;Woman of the Phoenix&quot; [with James Hooker] (Vince Bell) - 2:41 \n&quot;Tecumseh Valley&quot; [with Arlo Guthrie] (Townes Van Zandt) - 4:29 \n&quot;Three Flights Up&quot; (Frank Christian) - 3:31 \n&quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot; (Bob Dylan) - 5:17 \n&quot;Speed of the Sound of Loneliness&quot; [with John Prine] (John Prine) - 4:20 \n&quot;From Clare to Here&quot; [with Pete Cummins] (Ralph McTell) - 5:11 \n&quot;Can't Help But Wonder Where I'm Bound&quot; [with Carolyn Hester] (Tom Paxton) - 3:16 \n&quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; [with Guy Clark] (Woody Guthrie) - 2:52 \n&quot;This Old Town&quot; (Janis Ian, Jon Vezner) - 3:00 \n&quot;Comin' Down in the Rain&quot; [with Lee Satterfield] (Buddy Mondlock) - 3:45 \n&quot;Ten Degrees and Getting Colder&quot; [with Iris DeMent] (Gordon Lightfoot) - 2:40 \n&quot;Morning Song for Sally&quot; (Jerry Jeff Walker) - 4:55 \n&quot;Night Rider's Lament&quot; [with Don Edwards] (Michael Burton) - 3:57 \n&quot;Are You Tired of Me Darling?&quot; [with Iris DeMent and Emmylou Harris] (G.P.
