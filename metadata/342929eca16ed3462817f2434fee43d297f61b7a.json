Moving you to sing praises, weep in worship, or fall at the feet of Jesus. Todd applies his signature gritty and passionate vocal delivery to penetrating, emotional songs, leading the listener to a place of thoughtful introspection.\n\n*****************************\n*Ript with dBpoweramp*\nArtist: Todd Agnew\nAlbum: Reflection of Something\nDisc: 1 / 1\nGenre: Christian Rock\nYear: 2005\nChannels: 2  (stereo)\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz; \nSample Size: 16 bit\nBit Rate: 256 kbps\nEncoder: LAME 3.97 \nEncoder Settings: Variable Bit Rate  -V 0  (Extreme)\nAudio Quality: Very High  (Lossy)\nContains: ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI)]\nChannel Mapping: Left, Right\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\t\t\t\n1.
