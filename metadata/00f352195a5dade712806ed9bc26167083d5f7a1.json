Originally released on Blue Note 4149\n\n\n\nThis edition of No Room For Squares contains two tracks, &quot;Up A Step&quot; and &quot;Old World, New Imports&quot; that were recorded at an earlier session but appeared on the original LP. The tracks &quot;Syrup And Biscuits&quot; and &quot;Comin' Back&quot; that appeared on the first CD release of this album are omitted from this edition.\n\nNo Room For Squares is one of the more inventive titles in the Blue Note catalog. This is certainly an apt description for a session that includes the very hip Mobley and accompaniment from the swinging Lee Morgan, creative piano master Andrew Hill, sturdy bassist John Ore, and the powerful Philly Joe Jones on drums. Mobley's confident tenor wail is in full force here, as he and Morgan blow through the all-original program with strong support from the daring rhythm section. Squares is among Mobley's most raucous sessions. This is evident on energized tracks like the opening title track and the Latin-tinged &quot;Three Way Split.&quot; Also featured is Morgan's lush ballad &quot;Carolyn.&quot; In all, this is another stunning hard bop classic.\n\n1.Three Way Split \n2.Carolyn 3.Up a Step \n4.No Room for Squares \n5.Me 'N You \n6.Old World Imports  \n7.Carolyn (Alternate Take)  \n8.No Room for Squares \n\n\n\n\nPersonnel: Hank Mobley (tenor saxophone); Lee Morgan, Donald Byrd (trumpet); Andrew Hill, Herbie Hancock (piano); John Ore, Butch Warren (bass); Philly Joe Jones (drums).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f352195a5dade712806ed9bc26167083d5f7a1","amp;dn":"Hank+Mobley+No+Room+for+Squares%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00f352195a5dade712806ed9bc26167083d5f7a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,243,82,25,90,93,173,231,18,128,110,217,188,38,22,112,131,213,247,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
