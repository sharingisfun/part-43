It's a program that allows you to extract .rar files, which is what most of my uploads are. It should be 100% free, because after 6 months on a 40 day trial, I believe it's safe to say that it is. To be on the safe side, add a 2 to the end of the program, just before the .exe extension. I deleted the 2 to upload it a second time, after it failed the first. So all you have to do is install the .exe file. Please seed, it will make everyone's life easier. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9a2e0783a6238ce82a788d12542c0ac3074e6f","amp;dn":"winrar-x64-39.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9a2e0783a6238ce82a788d12542c0ac3074e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,154,46,7,131,166,35,140,232,42,120,141,18,84,44,10,195,7,78,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
