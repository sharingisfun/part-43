The material collected here is not quite as essential as her Atlantic recordings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ instead, the focus seems to weigh heavily toward middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary soul pop, which continued to translate into chart success, albeit a little more sporadic. This album includes her '80s smashes &quot;Freeway of Love,&quot; &quot;Jump to It,&quot; &quot;Who's Zoomin' Who,&quot; &quot;Another Night,&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Lee,&quot; as well as her chart-topping 1987 duet with George Michael, &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me),&quot; and her adult contemporary hit duet with Michael McDonald, &quot;Everchanging Times.&quot; Also included is the soulful &quot;Doctor's Orders&quot; with ace crooner Luther Vandross, and &quot;United Together,&quot; the greatest song Whitney Houston never recorded. This collection is not free of annoying omissions, among those are her essential duet with Eurythmics, &quot;Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves&quot;; her hit duet with Elton John, &quot;Through the Storm&quot;; and her hit remake of the Rolling Stones' &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash.&quot; That song, however, is included as a bonus track on select pressings of the album. A few new tracks are thrown in, including the Babyface-penned, assembly-line ballad &quot;Willing to Forgive,&quot; which became her first American Top 40 hit in five years, and her version of the Clivelles and Cole club anthem &quot;A Deeper Love,&quot; which went on to top the dance charts. The album closes with two live tracks, one being &quot;You Make Me Feel (Like a Natural Woman)&quot; with Bonnie Raitt and Gloria Estefan, and the fantastically soulful &quot;I Dreamed a Dream.&quot; Not a bad collection by any means, but some of the material is a little spotty, and it could have been quite better had they included all the hits.&quot;\n\nSee also:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4998966/Aretha_Franklin_-_Who_s_Zoomin__Who_[1985__320_kbps]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4998966/Aretha_Franklin_-_Who_s_Zoomin__Who_[1985__320_kbps]&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999355/Aretha_Franklin_-_Aretha_[1986__320_kbps]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999355/Aretha_Franklin_-_Aretha_[1986__320_kbps]&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999751/Aretha_Franklin_-_Through_The_Storm_[1989__320_kbps]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4999751/Aretha_Franklin_-_Through_The_Storm_[1989__320_kbps]&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5000997/Aretha_Franklin_-_What_You_See_Is_What_You..._[1991__320_kbps]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5000997/Aretha_Franklin_-_What_You_See_Is_What_You..._[1991__320_kbps]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nGreatest Hits 1980-1994\n=======================\n01.
