TPB's trackers are down. But I've been anticipating something like this for a while. So for those who'll want to download torrents I've made and will make in the future, I'm moving nearly all of them to another torrent-site, maybe two. I guess it'll be at least: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJust browse for the torrents on that site, and all uploads will come up, just give me some days.. :-)\n\nAnd you can still start your download from this site!! Just add these trackers to the torrent, and we'll find each other again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n \nNow don't click on the &quot;links&quot; above, that won't work. Copy and paste them to add them to your trackers in the torrent-file.\n\nAnd be sure to enable DHT. It tracks too..\n  \nAnyway, they should also all be available by search on my alias, verifire, on for instance: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&lt;/a&gt;\n \n- because they search the contents and comments on the upload for tags as well as the title of the torrent.. Just give me some time..\n\nSee you later, when things are settled and (maybe) there's a working tracker on the site again, and I'll miss it terribly, but I hope for, and guess this isn't the last word on the matter. I'll upload stuff here anyway, as well as on the other sites...\n\nTPB WILL ALWAYS RULE!! THANK YOU, GUYS. YOU'VE BEEN A PLEASURE TO BE SHIPWRECKED WITH. IT'S AN HONOUR...\n\nVerifire.\n____________________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nPlease; bear with me when I beg of you to leave this stuff seeding on your machine for the benefit of others, who just like you, would like to watch this stuff. My machine is being hindered by &quot;someone&quot; closing ports for me, so I have to monitor and change ports constantly, just so that YOU will get a copy.. Please help me. Thank you.\n\nI'm uploading this video of the discovery of Noah's ark on mt. Ararat. The discovery was made in the 80's, so this is a transfer from old VHS to PAL DVD. Just (double?) click on the finished download, and it will mount and burn on DVD through what ever program you've got assigned for this. You don't even have to remove it from the download folder, and that's nice, because then you are helping others to get this video too.. \n:-)\nRon Wyatt, who made the discovery, is unfortunately dead. Cancer took him away to Jesus in 1999, but this is far from being the only important discovery this man made to prove the accuracy and reliability of the Bible. Seek and you shall find..\n\nThe narrator is Norwegian, so I'm only writing the above for those that live in other countries, but have friends that are Scandinavian, or maybe you've forgotten the language..? :-)\n\nNow in Norwegian:\n\nJeg laster hermed opp denne videoen om oppdagelsen av Noah's ark pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Ararat-fjellene. Oppdagelsen ble gjort pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ 80-tallet, sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ dette er en digitalisert utgave av en VHS-video til PAL DVD, med norsk kommentar. (Dobbel?) klikk bare pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ den ferdig nedlastede filen, sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ brenner den automatisk en DVD i det programmet du har oppsatt for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ brenne ISO, eller Image-filer. Du trenger ikke engang ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ fjerne den fra nedlastingsmappen din! Og det er jo bra, for da hjelper du andre ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ laste ned denne videoen ogsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥.. :-)\nRon Wyatt, som gjorde oppdagelsen, er desverre dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸d. Han dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸de i 1999 av kreft, og dette er langt ifra den eneste oppdagelsen han gjorde for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ bevise arkeologisk hvor pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥litelig Bibelen er..\n\nSÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸k, og du skal finne..\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;720417001b141b00171f131b1e32151f131b1e5c111d1f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6cecd13402d96bda098d0ee1edb63e0a00c8d5","amp;dn":"Noah%5C%27s+Ark+on+Ararat+-+Ron+Wyatt+-+Norwegian+Narrative.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6cecd13402d96bda098d0ee1edb63e0a00c8d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,108,236,209,52,2,217,107,218,9,141,14,225,237,182,62,10,0,200,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
