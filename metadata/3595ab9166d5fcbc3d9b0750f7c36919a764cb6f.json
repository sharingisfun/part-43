The films in the series are motivated by a central theme: how the blues evolved from parochial folk tunes to a universal language.\n\n\nThe Blues - Warming By The Devils Fire (Xvid)[m4ndr4]\n\nDirector Charles Burnett (Killer of Sheep, My Brother's Wedding, To Sleep with Anger) presents a tale about a young boy's encounter with his family in Mississippi in the 1950s, and intergenerational tensions between the heavenly strains of gospel and the devilish moans of the blues.\n\nSays Burnett: &quot;The sound of the blues was a part of my environment that I took for granted. However, as years passed, the blues slowly emerged as an essential source of imagery, humor, irony, and insight that allows one to reflect on the human condition. I always wanted to do a story on the blues that not only reflected its nature and its content, but also alludes to the form itself. In short, a story that gives you the impression of the blues.&quot;\n\nPerformances\n\nBig Bill Broonzy *\nElizabeth Cotten *\nReverend Gary Davis *\nIda Cox *\nWillie Dixon *\nLightnin' Hopkins *\nSon House *\nMississippi John Hurt *\nVasti Jackson\nBessie Smith *\nMamie Smith *\nVictoria Spivey *\nSister Rosetta Tharpe *\nDinah Washington *\nMuddy Waters *\nSonny Boy Williamson *\n\n*indicates archival performance\n\n\nTechInfo\n\nVideo............Xvid 1149 Kbps 656x368 (16/9) 25.000 fps \nAudio............MP3 256 kbps 48.0 KHz (2 chnls)\nRuntime..........01:28:56\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/theblues/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/theblues/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3595ab9166d5fcbc3d9b0750f7c36919a764cb6f","amp;dn":"The+Blues+-+Warming+By+The+Devils+Fire+%28Xvid%29++%5Bm4ndr4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3595ab9166d5fcbc3d9b0750f7c36919a764cb6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,149,171,145,102,213,252,188,61,155,7,80,247,195,105,25,167,100,203,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
