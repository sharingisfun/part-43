Have a look\nat this:\n\n\n&quot;There are three stages required for the performance of a ritually\ncorrect circumcision in Jewish law: the removal of the foreskin; the\ntearing of the underlying membraene so as to expose the glans\ncompletely; and the sucking away of the blood, m'tsitsah.&quot; Roger V.\nPavey. The Kindest Cut of All. Bognor Regis, W. Sussex: New Horizon.\n1981. pp. 87-88.\n\n&quot;The method to be adopted is laid down thus: 'One excises the\nforeskin, [that is] the entire skin covering the glans, so that the\ncorona is laid bare. Afterwards, one tears with the finger-nail the soft\nmembrane underneath the skin, turning it to the sides until the flesh\nof the glans appears. Thereafter, one sucks the membrane until the\nblood is extracted from the [more] remote places, so that no danger\n[to the infant] may ensue; and any circumciser who does not carry\nout the sucking procedure is to be removed [from his office].' . . . The\noperation itself, then, consists of three distinct acts: the excision of\nthe prepuce; the laceration of the mucous membrane covering the\nglans; and the sucking of the blood from the interior of the wound.&quot;\nImmanuel Jakobovits. Jewish Medical Ethics: A Comparative and\nHistorical Study of the Jewish Religious Attitude to Medicine and Its\nPractice. New York: Bloch Publishing Company. 1959. pp. 193-194.\n\n&quot;The baby cried, blood flowed on to his penis and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as the rabbi had\npredicted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Graham [the godfather] did not faint. The rabbi then\nbent over the baby and sucked the wound. I know this sounds awful,\nbut it is part of the Jewish tradition. It's supposed to help the\nhealing.&quot; Jack Shamash. &quot;My Son on the Cutting Edge.&quot; Independent\n(London), no. 3,797 (Thursday, December 17, 1998): p. R8.\n\n&quot;And what of the practice of sucking the bleeding penis? While\ncondemning the procedure, some physicians contend that it was used\nto stop bleeding.47 Not only is there little evidence for this theory,\nbut it was also a largely ineffective method. Furthermore, even in\nantiquity, surgeons had better methods to stop bleeding, such as\npressure, instruments, and medication.48 According to Dr. H. Speert\n(1953), Maimonides ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“staunchly supported this procedure [sucking\nthe bleeding penis] as a prophylactic measure against\ninflammation.'&quot;49 Edward Wallerstein. Circumcision: An American\nHealth Fallacy. New York: Springer Publishing Company. 1980. p.\n160.\n\n&quot;mezizah ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hebrew term for the third step in the Jewish\ncircumcision ritual, in which the mohel applies his mouth to the\nfreshly circumcised infant's penis and sucks up the first drops of\nblood. In more recent times this procedure has been carried out via a\ntube, as infections, venereal disease, and tuberculosis, sometimes\nresulting in the death of the infant, have occurred due to\ncontamination of the wound. Most Jewish circumcisors today have\neliminated this step from the circumcision ritual. Critics have\nattributed sadistic and homosexual implications to this practice,\nwhile defenders claim that this was simply all that was known during\nancient times to stop the bleeding.&quot; Rosemary Romberg.\nCircumcision: The Painful Dilemma. South Hadley, Massachusetts:\nBergin &amp; Garvey, Publishers, Inc. 1985. p. 395.\n\n&quot;The traditional practice of metzitzah b'peh, which has its roots in\nthe earliest history of the Jewish people and has survived unchanged\nto the present time, should be viewed with great respect. It is spoken\nof very positively in the Jewish literature on circumcision both as an\nessential part of the ritual and as a health measure which prevents\ninfection and promotes healing.&quot; Henry C. Romberg, M.D. Bris Milah:\nA book about the Jewish ritual of circumcision. Jerusalem/New York:\nFeldheim Publishers. 1982. pp. 57-58.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeems the jews like to claim that this practice is to help the healing of the\nwound from circumcision. However, circumcision is a barbaric practice that\nhas people lopping off the heads of their baby,s penises all over the world for\nno reason. Hope to hell your child isn't circumcised by a jewish doctor, or you\nmight just catch him sucking on your baby's penis. It's pathetic and\ndisgusting, but it's a well known and revered practice amongst jews. You can\nsee by the quotes above they defend this practice as necessary, but the\ncircumcision itself is just genital mutilation, and nothing more, so the blood\nsucking vampire ritual of licking a baby's penis is completely unnecessary. To\nthe jews, this is a ritual behavior, and has nothing to do with promoting\nhealing. It has to do with welcoming another demon into their flock, by having\nhis penis sucked by some disgusting rabbi at eight days old.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b1fbae7700a29245a5f0c07249d29a1ce5ead3c","amp;dn":"Metzizah+Bepeh.+-+%28+Jews+Suck+Baby+Penises+%29+%28News+Report%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b1fbae7700a29245a5f0c07249d29a1ce5ead3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,31,186,231,112,10,41,36,90,95,12,7,36,157,41,161,206,94,173,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
