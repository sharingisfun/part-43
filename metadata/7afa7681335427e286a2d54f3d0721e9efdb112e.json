On this, her eponymous first release -- well, eponymous if you read her name backwards -- she collaborates with Eric Mouquet, the visionary responsible for Deep Forest. This artistic connection should immediately align your compass of expectation and point it in the proper direction -- you're getting lots of immaculate synth effects, rollicking drums and anthem-like inspirational melodies. And donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t forget the strangely organic enfolding of unadulterated human voices from around the globe.\n\nIn Aral, Mouquet hands over the keys to his genre-defying music module to Lara, who jumps into his aural vehicle, revs up its engine and follows her own muse. Although her journey is definitely her own, it is also influenced by MoquetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vision and craft. They make a great team. \n\nCatherine Lara - Aral\n\n01 Eastern Land.mp3\n02 Unity.mp3\n03 Aral.mp3\n04 Blue Dawn.mp3\n05 Requiem For A Dying Sea.mp3\n06 Gypsy Tears.mp3\n07 In Between Nowhere.mp3\n08 Deeplara.mp3\n09 Marayeva.mp3\n10 Yoponomo.mp3\n11 Sea U Soon.mp3\n\nEnjoy and please seed and comment :)\nLook also at my other uploads i have more interesting music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afa7681335427e286a2d54f3d0721e9efdb112e","amp;dn":"Catherine+Lara+-+Aral","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afa7681335427e286a2d54f3d0721e9efdb112e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,250,118,129,51,84,39,226,134,162,213,79,61,7,33,233,239,219,17,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
