Since college, \nconfirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily married Nick (James) have been through thick \nand thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are vying to land a dream project\n that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), and Nick's wife, Geneva \n(Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside down when he inadvertently \nsees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur \ninvestigation dissolves into mayhem, he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. \nNow, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest presentation of their \ncareers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth to his best friend.\nWritten by Universal Pictures\n\n\nNOTE:\nAt the moment the audio is hungarian\nuntil you leave the English version. greetings.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/315/thumbs20110211235222.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/315/thumbs20110211235222.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWWW..CRAZY-TORRENT..COM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f3ce695a69a0de1322110069e2bb8b1403d6c51","amp;dn":"The+Dilemma+%282011%29.TS.V1.Audio+Hungarian.Crazy-torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f3ce695a69a0de1322110069e2bb8b1403d6c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,60,230,149,166,154,13,225,50,33,16,6,158,43,184,177,64,61,108,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
