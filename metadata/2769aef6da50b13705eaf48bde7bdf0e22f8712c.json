The opera is semi-narrative in form and deals with Mahatma Gandhi's early years in South Africa and his development of non-violent protest into a political tool. (&quot;Satyagraha&quot; is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;truth force&quot;).\n\nThe first two acts each contain three scenes; the last is one continuous scene. Each act is dominated by a single historic figure (non-singing role) overlooking the action from above: the Indian poet Ravindranath Tagore in Act I the Russian author Leo Tolstoy in Act II, the American Civil Rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr in Act III.\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2769aef6da50b13705eaf48bde7bdf0e22f8712c","amp;dn":"Philip+glass+-+Satyagraha_mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2769aef6da50b13705eaf48bde7bdf0e22f8712c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,105,174,246,218,80,177,55,5,234,244,139,222,123,223,14,34,248,113,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
