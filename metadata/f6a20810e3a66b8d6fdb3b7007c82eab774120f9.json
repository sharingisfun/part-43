Recorded live in 1966 and 1967, Live is transcendental church music, grounded in conventional African-American spirituality as it reaches exultantly for the sky. Traditional melody-then-solos structure splits at the seams as tunes spill into collective improvisation. The band often suggests a gaggle of patriots crying out in personal jubilation but rallying together, again and again, to sing a cherished anthem anew.\n\nAyler and Don Cherry maintain a constant tension between simple melodicism and rapturous free blowing in their soloing. &quot;Truth Is Marching In&quot; makes a triumphant New Orleans-style crash, while &quot;Divine Peacemaker&quot; has the regal quality of the music that announces a monarch's arrival. &quot;Angels&quot; is a lovely, if slightly tongue-in-cheek, duet between Ayler and pianist Call Cobbs Jr. The latter's changes are fashioned after the manner of an early-20th-century fantasia, his piano sounding as though it had spent its youth in a dingy Western saloon. Ayler blows a sweet lament over Cobbs' rolling arpeggios, conjuring images of divine winged messengers stumbling tipsily onto a street corner after a hard day at the ol' salvation grind.\n\nDisc One:\n1 - Holy Ghost 07:41\n2 - The Truth Is Marching In 12:42\n3 - Our Prayer 04:45\n4 - Spirits Rejoice 16:22\n5 - Divine Peacemaker 12:37\n6 - Angels 09:53\n\nDisc Two:\n1 - For John Coltrane 13:40\n2 - Change Has Come 06:24\n3 - Light in Darkness 10:59\n4 - Heavenly Home 08:51\n5 - Spiritual Rebirth 04:26\n6 - Infinite Spirit 06:37\n7 - Omega Is the Alpha 10:46\n8 - Universal Thoughts 08:22\nTotal Time: 02:14:05\n\nPersonnel on Disc One #1:\n* Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone\n* Don Ayler - trumpet\n* Joel Freedman - cello\n* Lewis Worrell - bass\n* Sunny Murray - drums\nRecorded at The Village Gate, New York City, on March 28, 1965\n\nPersonnel on Disc One #2-5:\n* Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone\n* Don Ayler - trumpet\n* Michel Sampson - violin\n* Bill Folwell &amp; Henry Grimes - basses\n* Beaver Harris - drums\nRecorded at The Village Vanguard, New York City, on December 18, 1966\n\nPersonnel on Disc One #6:\n* Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone\n* probably Call Cobbs Jr. - piano\nRecorded at The Village Vaanguard, New York City, on December 18, 1966\n\nPersonnel on Disc Two:\n* Albert Ayler - alto saxophone (#1), tenor saxophone (all others)\n* Don Ayler - trumpet (except on #1)\n* George Steele - trombone (on #8 only)\n* Michel Sampson - violin\n* Joel Freedman - cello\n* Bill Folwell &amp; Alan Silva - basses\n* Beaver Harris - drums (except on #1)\nRecorded at The Village Theatre, New York City, on February 26, 1967\n\nDisc 1  #1 Originally issued on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe New Wave In JazzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Impulse  AS-90)\nDisc 1 #2,#3  and Disc 2 #1,#2 Originally issued on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlbert Ayler in Greenwich Village (Impulse AS-9155)\nDisc 1#4-#6 and Disc 2 #3-#7  Originally issued on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlbert Ayler The Village Concerts (Impulse AS-9336-2)\nDisc 2 #8 is prev unissued.\n\nLight in Darkness and Heavenly Home are Mono.\nA version of  Saints was recorded at the Village Gate session but no master tape of that performance has survived\nAll other tracks are Stereo.\nUniversal Thoughts is incomplete most likely due to the tape running out. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a20810e3a66b8d6fdb3b7007c82eab774120f9","amp;dn":"Albert+Ayler+Live+in+Greenwich+Village+The+Complete++Impulse+Rec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6a20810e3a66b8d6fdb3b7007c82eab774120f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,162,8,16,227,166,107,141,111,219,59,112,7,200,46,171,119,65,32,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
