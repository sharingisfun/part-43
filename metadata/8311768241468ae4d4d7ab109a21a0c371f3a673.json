Greatest Hits is an airtight argument for Petty's own greatness. Starting with &quot;American Girl,&quot; the rollicking, Byrds-inspired single from Petty's first album in 1976, this compilation presents a chronological overview of the guitarist-vocalist's career with and without the Heartbreakers, also chronically underrated as one of today's best bands. Every one of the 16 older tracks is a well-crafted gem, full of solid guitar hooks (&quot;Here Comes My Girl&quot;), arresting images (&quot;Don't Come Around Here No More&quot;) and simple but poetic lyrics (&quot;The Waiting&quot;).\n\nPetty isn't an innovator; he's a talented craftsman with impeccable taste and a strong sense of rock history, internalizing influences ranging from the Beatles' psychedelic masterpiece, Revolver, to the best of '70s punk. (It's interesting to remember that early efforts such as &quot;Refugee&quot; and &quot;Don't Do Me Like That&quot; first won Petty attention as a New Wave artist). With his Dylanesque vocals and chiming 12-string guitars, Petty is more often linked these days with the sounds of the '60s. But recent tunes such as &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot; are as smart, relevant and (dare I say) alternative as anything in MTV's Buzz Bin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8311768241468ae4d4d7ab109a21a0c371f3a673","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+%26+The+Heartbreakers+-+Greatest+Hits+%28Flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8311768241468ae4d4d7ab109a21a0c371f3a673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,17,118,130,65,70,138,228,212,215,171,16,154,33,160,195,113,243,166,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
