Tentative sale date is August 8th - bookmark the link \nbelow so you can find O&amp;A. Even if this sale doesn't happen - the \nowners are willing to sell which means tpb could cease to exist \nin it's current form at some point. Be ready for that day now.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS NOW!! And long live the free interwebs!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother heads up: I'll be back on the later schedule for next \nweek only. That means 64k's up between 12 - 1:30 est, and 128k's \nup around 7ish. Sorry for any issues that causes but it is \nwhat it is. Should be the last of it for awhile, next &quot;heads up&quot; \ncould be retirement depending on how things play out. I love \ngetting O&amp;A out to the fans but I won't be able to do it forever. \nSomeone else will step up for the community when the time comes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb32a7afd87cc845a50b1f3a8a30b8a6ac5745c7","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-07-30-O%26A+CF64k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb32a7afd87cc845a50b1f3a8a30b8a6ac5745c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,50,167,175,216,124,200,69,165,11,31,58,138,48,184,166,172,87,69,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
