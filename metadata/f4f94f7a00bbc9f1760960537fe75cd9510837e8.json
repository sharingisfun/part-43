It was certified platinum by the RIAA on October 20, 2008.\n\nLove on the Inside has received mostly favorable reviews from music critics, with many reviews focusing on the song selection and Nettles' vocal performance, as well as the production of Byron Gallimore, who also produced their 2006 album Enjoy the Ride. Thom Jurek of Allmusic gave the album four stars out of five, commends the use of minimal overdubs in the production. Of the song choices, he said, &quot;While this set is saturated with hunger and ambition, it's also confident and sophisticated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the album sounds as if they meant every word but had a great time making it.&quot; He cited &quot;We Run&quot;, &quot;Joey&quot; and &quot;Love&quot; as standout tracks. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave it an A- rating, saying that the album's ballads recalled Mary Chapin Carpenter and Rodney Crowell, while other tracks such as &quot;All I want to Do&quot; were &quot;goofy, areana-ready crowd-pleasers&quot;. Billboard critic Ken Tucker also gave a positive review, saying that Gallimore's production was &quot;finely crafted&quot; and that &quot;All I Want to Do&quot; was a &quot;tantalizing tease&quot; of the album's breadth.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4f94f7a00bbc9f1760960537fe75cd9510837e8","amp;dn":"Sugarland+-+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4f94f7a00bbc9f1760960537fe75cd9510837e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,249,79,122,0,187,201,241,118,9,96,83,127,231,92,217,81,8,55,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
