Dave and Peter left Country Joe in May of 1969 with the intention of re-forming Big Brother with guitarist David Nelson. They auditioned several singers including Eddie Money, Kathi MacDonald and John Herald but the band finally came back together in the fall of 1969 with nearly the same line-up (except Joplin): Albin, Andrew, Getz and Gurley were joined by Nick Gravenites (vocals), Dave Schallock (guitar) and Kathi McDonald (vocals). Be a Brother was released in 1970, and was the first album without Janis Joplin. James Gurley now was on the bass while Peter Albin became the rhythm guitar player, Sam Andrew singing more of the lead vocals with Kathi McDonald, David Schallock on lead guitar, Dave Getz on the drums and occasional keyboards. Nick Gravenites would also produce the album, write and sing on a number of the tracks. They releasad their last studio album, How Hard It Is, in 1971. The same lineup: Kathi and Sam and Nick on vocals joined by organist Mike Finnegan. The band remained with this lineup until 1972 but drugs, loss of management, lack of gigs and internal squabbles caused them to gradually fall apart and disband during that year. During the next 15 years they re-united once to play &quot;The Tribal Stomp&quot; in 1978 at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70d2e5b6c87f86f16f3fb1b10fa55ab3a4bc71a5","amp;dn":"Big+Brother+and+the+Holding+Company%5C%2770+-+Be+a+Brothers+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70d2e5b6c87f86f16f3fb1b10fa55ab3a4bc71a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,210,229,182,200,127,134,241,111,63,177,177,15,165,90,179,164,188,113,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
