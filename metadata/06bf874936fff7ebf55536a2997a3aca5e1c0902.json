It is the most realistic rendition of the airport to date. Attention to detail has been the key behind developing Shannon Airport and all airport structures have been included with the scenery. Shannon Airport is the last stopover for many transatlantic flights leaving Europe and so is an important airport on the west coast of Ireland. Updates are released on a regular basis also which allows for the most up-to-date and realistic experience when flying into Shannon.\n\n\nScenery Features\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Docking system for 6 aircraft type (fs2004 only)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Highly detailed virtual replica of the airport\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Both animated and static ground vehicles\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Impressive frame rates\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Photo realistic day and night textures\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Realistic runway and taxiway lighting\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 3-D Approach lights\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 3-D Papi lights\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 3-D Runway hold short lights\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Landclass Data for surrounding area\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Realistic Navigation aids\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Realistic Ground Markings\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Extensive manual with information about the airport.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Afcad included.\n\nSystem requirements for FS2004\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 (Version 9.1)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pentium 2, 6 GHz 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Graphic card with 256 MB RAM\n\nSystem requirements for FSX\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Microsoft Flight Simulator X (SP2)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Pentium 2, 6 GHz 1 GB RAM (2 GB recommended)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Graphic card with 256 MB RAM\n\nPurchase Information\n\nCost: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬17.01 (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬14.00 excluding VAT.)\n\nScenery can be bought through our website via Paypal.
