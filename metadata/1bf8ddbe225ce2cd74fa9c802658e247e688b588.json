He was so fascinated by the music that he started to spin himself and developed a unique style. Several years and many parties later, he founded together with some friends &quot;Project 2000&quot; and became resident DJ at the &quot;Helium&quot; bar in Frankfurt. Since then, his career rose quickly through the ranks and soon, he was playing at the main room of the &quot;CocoonClub&quot;. At that time, he was already a guarantor for ambitious music beyond the mainstream. Meanwhile, Markus Fix has become a trendsetter himself: his releases on the partner labels &quot;CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cille Records&quot; and &quot;Oslo&quot; were top sellers and gained enthusiastic reviews worldwide. Also as a DJ, he belongs to the global players and elates both promoters as well as the public!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf8ddbe225ce2cd74fa9c802658e247e688b588","amp;dn":"MINIMAL+-+Markus+Fix+-+Live+%40Cocoon+Club+Frankfurt+-+25.02.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf8ddbe225ce2cd74fa9c802658e247e688b588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,248,221,190,34,92,226,205,116,250,156,128,38,88,226,71,230,136,181,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
