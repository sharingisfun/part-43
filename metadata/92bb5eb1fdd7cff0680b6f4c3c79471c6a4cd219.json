The first issue featured the rock band Kiss in an original adventure. It also had the band members mix their blood with printing ink in a gimmick exploited by Marvel and Stan Lee in particular.\n\nThe first few issues featured either established Marvel titles which were not printed elsewhere, (Weirdworld, Star-Lord ) or film adaptations. Each film adaptation normally came with features on the film as back up material.  From issue 14 the series settled into only containing film adaptations. These were normally reprinted without the feature material as two to four issue mini-series by Marvel. The series was cancelled with issue 41 in 1985.\n\nThe Marvel Super Special issue #7, an adaptation of the Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band film, was withdrawn at the last minute by Marvel due to undisclosed reasons and all copies (if any were indeed printed) were destroyed prior to distribution.  A few copies were printed in France, the Netherlands and Germany, however no english language copies are known to exist, and even George Perez, who illustrated the comic, has stated that he has never seen a copy himself, and in interviews he has said that he considers it to be &quot;the rarest piece of George Perez printed artwork you can find&quot;.  The next issue published, the Battlestar Galactica Super Special, skipped ahead on the numbering to #8, despite issue #7 being cancelled and never published in the U.S., or in any other english language territories.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92bb5eb1fdd7cff0680b6f4c3c79471c6a4cd219","amp;dn":"Marvel+Comics+Super+Special","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92bb5eb1fdd7cff0680b6f4c3c79471c6a4cd219","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,187,94,177,253,215,207,240,104,11,111,76,60,121,71,28,106,76,210,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
