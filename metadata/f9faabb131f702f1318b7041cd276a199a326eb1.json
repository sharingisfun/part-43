The programmes followed a similar format to The Shuttleworths, but their new length of thirty minutes allowed guest slots (Impress an Impresario, Make Mary Merry) and opportunities to interview celebreties on the show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCast:\nJohn Shuttleworth\n\n\nRadio Shuttleworth - S01 - E01 - Leo Sayer\nRadio Shuttleworth - S01 - E02 - Wendy Craig\nRadio Shuttleworth - S01 - E03 - Patrick Moore\nRadio Shuttleworth - S01 - E04 - Vanessa Feltz\nRadio Shuttleworth - S01 - E05 - John Kettley\n\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E01 - Barbara Dickson\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E02 - Richard Whiteley\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E03 - Tony Hart\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E04 - Peter Purves\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E05 - Katrina Leskanich\nRadio Shuttleworth - S02 - E06 - Matthew Kelly\n\n.\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n[b]\nA number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them.\n\nThere is little point in downloading a &quot;Torrent&quot; and then recreating a &quot;Torrent&quot; using the same files.\n\nThe fact there was a torrent for you to download is clear you don't need to use the files to make another exactly the same version,\n\nAll you will do is split seeders over 2 torrents with the &quot;same&quot; files and make both have less seeders.\n\n\n[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9faabb131f702f1318b7041cd276a199a326eb1","amp;dn":"Radio+Shuttleworth+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9faabb131f702f1318b7041cd276a199a326eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,250,171,177,49,247,2,241,49,139,112,65,205,39,106,25,154,50,110,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
