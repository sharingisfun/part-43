I converted the files from .shn to FLAC using SWITCH Sound File Converter. There were some problems downloading the files, but it seems to be OK now. The text below has been copied from the original uploader.\n\n\n\n\nBruce performs an amazing sounding acoustic concert here in a very small venue. I was seated dead center in the front row balcony for this.\nThis is my best recording to date and is often mistaken for a soundboard recording.\nThe audience was very quiet and the acoustics near perfect.\nThis show is way too good to keep for myself and close friends, so here it is for you good people to enjoy as well.\n\n\n\nThe setlist was as follows...\n\n01. 7:03 Dream Like Mine \n02. 6:49 Lovers In A Dangerous Time \n03. 6:39 Anything Anytime Anywhere \n04. 3:27 The Trouble With Normal \n05. 5:45 When You Give It Away \n06. 4:51 All The Ways I Want You \n07. 7:37 Tibetan Side Of Town \n08. 4:46 Tokyo \n09. 3:43 Open \n10. 9:39 Rumours Of Glory \n11. 7:10 My Beat \n12. 6:02 Put It In Your Heart \n13. 5:25 Let The Bad Air Out \n14. 3:37 Call It Democracy \n15. 6:24 Justice \n16. 5:27 Wondering Where The Lions Are \n17. 4:59 Last Night Of The World \n18. 6:12 World Of Wonders\n19. 6:30 Pacing The Cage \n20. 5:31 Peggy's Kitchen Wall \n21. 6:18 If I Had A Rocket Launcher \n22. 4:23 Messenger Wind\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f58354f786d39964b7955ec1de073525b4a184","amp;dn":"Bruce+Cockburn+-+An+Evening+With...+%5BToronto+2002%5D+%5BKaz77%5D+%5BEdit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f58354f786d39964b7955ec1de073525b4a184","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,245,131,84,247,134,211,153,100,183,149,94,193,222,7,53,37,180,161,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
