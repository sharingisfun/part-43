It is set on the fictional planet Aeres, a fantastic world of gigantic floating islands, which are the remnants of the planet from before it exploded. After Aeres broke apart, the few surviving inhabitants settled on the drifting fragments of the planet. You are a nomad, a restless soul forever in pursuit of adventure. You wander across the planet on your island, discovering mysterious artifacts and exploring the ruins of the long dead race of Master Builders. The only place to fall to is the Sea of Flames, the very bottom level of this new world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51126d776b0e1a2eb62b5dd9fdad1dff8103c144","amp;dn":"Project%3A+Nomads","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51126d776b0e1a2eb62b5dd9fdad1dff8103c144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,18,109,119,107,14,26,46,182,43,93,217,253,173,29,255,129,3,193,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
