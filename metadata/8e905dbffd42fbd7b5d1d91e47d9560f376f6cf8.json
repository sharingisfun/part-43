This was the final gig for Delirious?, \nand there could hardly have been a better celebration of all that God has done through this band. Twenty-four hours later, Martin Smith had this to say:?\n What can I say? It was awesome, sad, happy, and definitive. One can never correctly adjudicate ones emotions at times like this but I feel at peace. \nI feel joy. I feel like I?ve completed an assignment.?\n\nAnd what an assignment it was. A Dove Award-winning, Grammy nominated, RIAA Certified Gold-selling assignment.\nDelirious? helped score a whole new soundtrack for the church around the world, bringing honesty, passion, \nintimacy and heavenly pride back to the church and beyond.
