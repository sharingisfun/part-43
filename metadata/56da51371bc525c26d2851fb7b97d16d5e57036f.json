That isnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t much of an observation, and certainly not one that you would like to hear from your favourite webzine (thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s what we hope anyway...) There are, however, enough biases that one could have when initially reading the information about this record: Das Pop draw their inspiration from the exhausted puddle of eighties and seventies music, they are from Belgium (that could be a prejudice, arguably), and on their last tour they all wore white t-shirts containing ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œI LOVEÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (the name of their debut record), like those bumper stickers that usually invoke aggressive behaviour towards other motorists. One could argue therefore that Das Pop is just another retro-style band, trying to cash in on a current hype.\n\nThis is, however, not the case.\n\nThe Human Thing is the follow-up to 2000ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s I Love, which consisted of not-taking-itself-all-too-serious retro eighties pop with rocky elements. It wasnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t bad, but it didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t overcome the barrier that Das Pop set for themselves by making a record with such a gimmick-like approach. That didnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t stop I Love from becoming successful in Western Europe. For the band, however, it wasnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t satisfying. So, they forced themselves to record something that would prove that they werenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t destined to wear those ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œI LoveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ shirts for the next decade.\n\nAnd see: The Human Thing is more varied, thoughtful and longer enjoyable than I Love. The most admirable fact is how Das Pop succeeded in making all the elements of a song fit together, with an incredible feeling for timing. On exactly the right moment the musical elements enter the song in such a way that it makes you grin for a few seconds, just because it is played in exactly the right position.\n\nDas Pop has succeeded in creating a record that brings other musical styles to mind, but has enough of their own to be distinctive, and indeed, very enjoyable.\n\n1.
