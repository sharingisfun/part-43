He'd been getting into Neil Young, smoking joints and making pilgrimages to Nick Drake's grave, but nothing could have prepared us for quite such a return to form. The mood was autobiographical, most notably on &quot;Has My Fire Really Gone Out&quot; and the title track--both of which dealt with the writer's block that plagued Weller after The Style Council. And yet, Wild Wood is anything but morose: flutes and sundazed guitars adorn more pastoral moments; &quot;Shadow Of The Sun&quot; takes stock of youthful idealism and finds redemption in the wisdom of years; and &quot;Sunflower&quot; remains a superlative burst of psychedelic powerpop. But more than actual songs, it's the instrumental passages and interconnecting refrains that truly reveal their author's attention to detail--and give Wild Wood an edge over the rest of his solo material.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nPaul Weller - vocals, guitar, keyboards\nJacko Peake -flute\nDee C.
