A young Air Force brat witnesses a horrific mid-air collision over the Arizona desert. One of the surviving pilots is Ray 27, a bright-eyed freedom fighter who has blasted into the past in his polymorphic aircraft in a desperate, heroic bid to eradicate his own dystopian future. Or is he an evil-eyed temporal terrorist, here in a psychotic bid to destroy a utopian future? The answer lies at the very heart of this painstakingly researched and crisply rendered aviation adventure series by Ken Steacy. Aggressively pursued by spatio-temporal agents from the future as well as by opponents from the present, Ray and his antagonists must ultimately confront their own humanity before events he has set in motion reach their shattering conclusion! Strap yourself in . . . there's major turbulence ahead!\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5df6c38bca72c9db3606baabfed59ed18ee376c9","amp;dn":"Tempus+Fugitive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5df6c38bca72c9db3606baabfed59ed18ee376c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,246,195,139,202,114,201,219,54,6,186,171,254,213,158,209,142,227,118,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
