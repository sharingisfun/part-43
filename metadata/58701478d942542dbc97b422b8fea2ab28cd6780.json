Wolverine is a mutant,\npossessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually \nany wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\nThe first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to rescue Mariko from her father.\nAt this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan \nadventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his concepts of honor and family. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSynopsis:\n--------------\n\nEpisode 9 is Titled &quot;Hell Road&quot;\n---------------------------------\n Logan and yukio begin their battle through the Deadly traps that give the hell road it's fearsome reputation.\nThe 1st trap they encounter fires hundreds of razor sharp spears at them from the walls, they manage to get past but\nThe Bike is destroyed leaving them to set out on foot and fall straight into a spear filled pit. Meanwhile the rebel leader Koh \ngathers his men and prepares for their attack on the dragon palace. Yokio and Logan escape the pit but run straight into \none of the criminal gangs responsible for setting them and another fight begins. Elsewhere Shingen tells the robot statue Vadhaka \nthat he will have another chance to atone for his disgrace in failing to kill Logan. As Yukio and logan fight their way through \nthe thugs and their traps the criminals also start to take advantage of the disruption of the status quo and attack each other,\ncausing even more chaos and destruction. The rebels start their march behind Master Koh and his apprentice Min but their &quot;secret \ntunnel&quot; falls far short of the map they showed Logan and they surface at the entrance to Hell Road and begin the march down it.\n Logan and Yukio have been delayed by some giant pendulum blades but he takes a desperate gambel and breaks through. \n The chaos intensifies and all the gangs join the battle, wrecking each others traps further and killing each other off so that \nby the time Min,Koh and the rebels arrive there is very little left to threaten them, Wolverine realises he was duped into \nrunning the gauntlet and clearing the danger for them as there never was a secret tunnel. Logan and Yukio leave the rebels \nto deal with the last of the defenders while they head on to the Dragon Palace but they are stopped by the appearance of\nKikyo, the Mutant assassin is back to settle his score.\n\n\nJapanese cast:\n---------------\nRikiya Koyama as James Howlett Logan/Wolverine\nFumiko Orikasa as Mariko Yashida\nHidekatsu Shibata as Shingen Yashida\nKazuki Yao as Hideki Kurohagi\nMasaki Terasoma as Tesshin Asano\nMasato Hagiwara as Kikyo Mikage\nRomi Park as Yukio\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n-----------\nOnce again, All credit for subtitle translation goes to Weapon+\nwithout their work my avi conversion would be pretty useless :)\n\nSpoken Language:-   Japanese\nSubtitle Language:- English\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:29.876\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : DX50\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42254\nVideoBitRate       : 902844\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFile Format:- AVI\n------------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:-\n-------------\n[URL=http://img163.imageshack.us/i/wolverineanime09hellroa.jpg/][IMG]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/3411/wolverineanime09hellroa.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nHash:\n-----------\n58701478D942542DBC97B422B8FEA2AB28CD6780\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace on irc.cartoonpalace.info for more Cartoons and Anime.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58701478d942542dbc97b422b8fea2ab28cd6780","amp;dn":"Wolverine%5Banime%5D-109-Hell%7ERoad-Eng-Subs-Divx%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58701478d942542dbc97b422b8fea2ab28cd6780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,112,20,120,217,66,84,45,188,151,180,34,184,254,162,171,40,205,103,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
