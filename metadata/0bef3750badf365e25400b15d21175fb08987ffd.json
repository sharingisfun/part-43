In disgust, Vicky teams up with a former partner, Victor Prince (Cesar Romero), and leaves for the great outdoors while Dan attempts to go on without her. Unfortunately, the Commissioner (Jackie Gleason), Dan's harried agent, can only find backing for a new show if Dan and Vicky reunite and soon everyone, including ditzy secretary Rosita Murphy (Carmen Miranda) and Dan's flibbertigibbet valet McTavish (Edward Everett Horton), descends on the Canadian resort of Lake Louise where Harry James and His Music Makers make their headquarter. The usual complications arise but McTavish suddenly inherits a handsome sum of money and agrees to back a new show starring Vicky and Dan, Victor and Rosita, and the ubiquitous Harry James.Betty Grable performs &quot;Ciribiribin and other popular selections, Carmen Miranda makes mincemeat of &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; (in Portuguese, no less!), while band vocalist Helen Forrest and the Music Makers take care of the film's hit tune, Harry Warren and Mack Gordon's &quot;I Had the Craziest Dream&quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035370/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035370/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nIrving Cummings\n\n\n\tBetty Grable\t... \tVicky Lane\n\n\tCarmen Miranda\t... \tRosita Murphy\n\tJohn Payne\t... \tDan Christy\n\n\tCesar Romero\t... \tVictor Prince\n\tCharlotte Greenwood\t... \tPhoebe Gray\n\n\n[Movie] TVRIP\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:30:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x496 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1106 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,14 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bef3750badf365e25400b15d21175fb08987ffd","amp;dn":"Springtime+in+the+Rockies+%281942%29+Betty+Grable%2CCarmen+Miranda+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bef3750badf365e25400b15d21175fb08987ffd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,239,55,80,186,223,54,94,37,64,11,21,210,17,117,251,8,152,127,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
