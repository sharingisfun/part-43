I'm having a contest this month for a free BIRP shirt. If you register at www.BlalocksIRP.com and view your profile you'll see a referral link. You can use this link to refer other people to the site. If anyone signs up to the site using your link you'll be awarded 1 point. (Shows up on the side of the main page) The user who has the most points at the end of the month wins a shirt. :) Also, I included a flier with the mp3's. I would appreciate it very much if any of you guys were willing to print these out and post them/hand them out at shows, venues, or bars. If you send me a picture of them posted up I'll award 3-5 points towards the contest. (Congrats to ADR who one the last one.)\n\nThe Community Playlist on the site has almost hit 100 tracks as well. As mentioned earlier once it hits 100 I'll be uploading a torrent andlink of it as well. Once that's done everyone can start over making selections. If you're not familiar with that then it's easy. On the forum everyone who has signed up to the site gets the opportunity to choose 1 track for the playlist and post it in the forum. I then put it up for stream on the site and then upload the playlist in full at 100 tracks.\n\nNot trading CD's so much these days. So busy. But if you'd like to send me a mixed CD (Love to get them in the mail, and maybe you'd like to see yours added to the site/my wall) or if your a band and would like to send me a demo to review please send me an email at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f993968a919b959895969a92b99e94989095d79a9694&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and i'll give you some details.\n\nT-shirts are for sale! Check them out at www.BlalocksIRP.com under the merch section. New design will be up soon as well.\n\nHope you guys like this month's cover. Was a lot of fun to create. :D\n\nI suppose thats all.
