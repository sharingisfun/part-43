After Peter Green left and with the additions of Christine McVie &amp; Bob Welch, they shifted away from blues music towards a more pop sound. In 1975, Bob Welch left the group and Mick Fleetwood enlisted an unknown duo of Lindsey Buckingham &amp; Stevie Nicks in the band. The result is of course music history. This is the first effort by the new lineup and it is an excellent collection of songs. Lindsey Buckingham has one of the best ears in music and his hands are all over the album. From the album's opener &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and his own &quot;Blue Letter&quot; and the slow burning &quot;World Turning&quot; to Christine McVie's &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;, his presence is felt. &quot;Crystal&quot; is great song taken from the Buckingham-Nicks album and shows how well the band's voices meld together. Stevie Nicks carved out her witch persona with the ethereal and moody &quot;Rhiannon&quot;. She also contributes one of most hauntingly beautiful songs ever recorded, &quot;Landslide&quot;. Through constant touring and radio airplay, the album slowly climbed the charts and in its 53rd week on the charts, it finally reached number one. This album set the stage for one of the biggest albums in history, Rumours. While not as popular as that album, this album is it's equal in quality and sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0243df3bc3d81f4e7ea168caa6080b024b9c9335","amp;dn":"Fleetwood+Mac+-+%281975%29+MFSL+LP+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0243df3bc3d81f4e7ea168caa6080b024b9c9335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,67,223,59,195,216,31,78,126,161,104,202,166,8,11,2,75,156,147,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
