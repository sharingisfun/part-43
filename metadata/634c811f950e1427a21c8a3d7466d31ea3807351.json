Soundboard -- excellent sound. Differs from the 2000\nbootleg with the same title, dropping &quot;Lovin' You Is Sweeter Than Ever,&quot; but\nadding &quot;We Can Talk&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released.&quot;\n\nTracks (.FLAC FORMAT)\n\n1. Chest Fever\n2. Don't Do It\n3. Tears Of Rage\n4. We Can Talk\n5. Long Black Veil\n6. Don't Ya Tell Henry\n7. Ain't No More Cane On The Brazos\n8. This Wheel 's On Fire\n9. Lovin' You Is Sweeter Than Ever *\n10. The Weight\n11. I Shall Be Released\n\nNote: &quot;Lovin' You Is Sweeter Than Ever&quot; was played at Woodstock and most likely\ncame before &quot;The Weight&quot;.\n\n* To keep the integrity of the original setlist as described by various sources\n&quot;Lovin' You Is Sweeter Than Ever Has been included from the 2000 boot in this offering.\n\n There is varying information and opinions about this show as far as what set was played that night and in what order, but a simple search on The Band Website site should provide enough information as to support the setlist, although there is still no concrete information as to the order. 40 years ago the Band put on one of the best shows of the Woodstock festival and it still remains in almost complete obscurity, except for a few videos floating around on various boots and other places ie:and The Weight on the Woodstock Lost Preformances VHS Video.\n\n Why this was once again excluded from the 40th Anniversary Woodstock offering is inexcusable. So sit back and enjoy a trip back in time...just stay off the towers and PLAY IT LOUD!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634c811f950e1427a21c8a3d7466d31ea3807351","amp;dn":"The+Band+-+August+17%2C+1969+-+Bethel+NY+-+Woodstock+Festival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634c811f950e1427a21c8a3d7466d31ea3807351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,76,129,31,149,14,20,39,162,28,138,61,116,102,211,30,163,128,115,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
