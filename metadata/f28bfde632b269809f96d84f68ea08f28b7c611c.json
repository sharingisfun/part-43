It is a Bootable CD; thus, it can be useful even if the primary operating system cannot be booted. Hiren's Boot CD has an extensive list of software. Utilities with similar functionality on the CD are grouped together and seem redundant; however, they present choices through UI differences.\n\n----------------------------------------\nHiren's BootCD 10.1\n----------------------------------------\n+ BootCD Customizer to create custom bootable cd\n+ RegBak 1.0\n+ Grub4Dos installer 1.1\n+ USB Format Tool\n+ MbrFix 1.3\n+ MBRWizard 2.0b (for windows)\n+ Diskman 4.2 (for windows)\n+ FileDisk Mount Tool 25\n+ GPU-Z 0.3.6\n+ Dependency Walker 2.2 \n- ace.exe rar.exe arj.exe unrar.exe\n- PC-Config 9.33\n- BootMagic\n- PC Doctor 2004\n- LapLink 5.0\n- Lost &amp; Found 1.06\n- Partition Table Doctor 3.5\nProgram Launcher 1.3 (Autorun.exe)\nBIOS Cracker 5.0\nEASEUS Partition Master 4.1.1\nDriveImage XML 2.13\nRecuva 1.32\nMemtest86+ 4.00\nIBM/Hitachi Drive Fitness Test 4.16\nIBM/Hitachi Feature Tool 2.15\nNavratil Software System Information 0.60.38\nAstra 5.44\nCPU Identification utility 1.18\nPC Wizard 2009.1.911\nSIW 2009-10-22\nUSBDeview 1.47\nMBRTool 2.3.200\nTrueCrypt 6.3\nProduKey 1.38\nWirelessKeyView 1.30\nMessenPass 1.27\nMail PassView 1.52\nOpera Web Browser 8.53 (with flash support)\n7-Zip 9.07 beta\nCCleaner 2.25\nCurrPorts 1.80\nOpenedFilesView 1.46\nUnlocker 1.8.8\nRegScanner 1.80\nAutoruns 9.56\nSilent Runners Revision 60\nXp-AntiSpy 3.97.5\nShell Extensions Manager (ShellExView) 1.45\nMalwarebytes Anti-Malware 1.41 (1811)\nSmitFraudFix 2.424\nSuperAntispyware 4.30 (1811)\nUnknownDevices 1.4.20 (1811)\nKaspersky Virus Removal Tool 7.0.0.290 (1811)\nSpywareBlaster 4.2 (1811)\nPCI 32 Sniffer 1.4 (1811)\nPCI and AGP info Tool (1811)\nComboFix (1811)\nSpybot - Search &amp; Destroy 1.6.2 (1811)\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security.
