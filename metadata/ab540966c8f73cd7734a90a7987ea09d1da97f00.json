Readers of both &quot;Linux Journal and &quot;TUX Magazine confirmed this by voting Ubuntu as the best Linux distribution in each publication's 2005 Readers Choice Awards. None of that simplification, however, makes Ubuntu any less fun if you're a hacker or a power user. Like all books in the &quot;Hacks&quot; series, &quot;Ubuntu Hacks includes 100 quick tips and tricks for all users of all technical levels. Beginners will appreciate the installation advice and tips on getting the most out of the free applications packaged with Ubuntu, while intermediate and advanced readers will learn the ins-and-outs of power management, wireless roaming, 3D video acceleration, server configuration, and much more.\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu Linux Toolbox\n\nAutor: Christopher Negus, Francois Caen \nWydawnictwo: Wiley John + Sons\nLiczba stron: 333\nFormat:231 mm x 154 mm x 24 mm \nISBN/EAN:9780470082935\nRok wydania: grudzieÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ 2007 r.\nFormat: PDF\n\n\nOpis produktu: Ubuntu Linux Toolbox\n\nExplore a ton of powerful Ubuntu Linux commands This handy, compact guide teaches you to use Ubuntu Linux as the experts do: from the command line.
