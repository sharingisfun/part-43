Release 1995. Remastered. \n\n\nGeorge Hamilton IV has been the best ambassador country ever had. His 40-year career began with A Rose And A Baby Ruth in 1956, and he was a rock 'n' roll star for several years before he became one of the first rockers to return to country music. After signing with RCA, he broadened country music, recording songs by folk musicians. This set contains all the Colonial and ABC recordings, including A Rose And A Baby Ruth and Why Don't They Understand, as well as his RCA recordings up to 1965, including Abilene and Forth Worth, Dallas Or Houston.
