So, it's time to share these.\n\nThese are sandboxed exe's from back when spoon.net was called Xenocode. You can run them in parallel. They are functionally identical to the true browsers\n\n*Mr. &quot;Steve&quot; has commented (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/02/01/html5-and-web-video-questions-for-the-industry-from-the-community.aspx#10123662) on tons of IEBlog posts, and quickly summarizes why the spoon.net browsers are the easiest way to test cross-browser:\n-- Multiple IEs - IE8 breaks the functionality of IE6's textboxes.\n-- ETester - works great until you need to test print preview or popup interaction and then it fails.\n-- Virtual PC with timebombed images of IE6, IE7, IE8 - works, but the 12GB of HD space needed is frustrating when each full image of Windows dies 4 times a year, running a full Windows image is slow and you have to beg for updates because the releases are not co-ordinated and announced well at all.\n-- IE Super Preview - does not allow full testing of IE user interaction, JavaScript DOM changes, popups etc.\n-- Multiple PC's to run multiple versions of windows and IE. With all the hardware, software, and physical space needed. Ha!\n-- Spoon.net IEs - They work, they work just like local native apps once running, and there's no hacking of my real local IE install.\n\nBrought to you by http://iecss.com/spoon; people who want to make web development easier for you.\n\nInstallation Instructions: \nSimply run the executable in your windows installation. If you run into problems, try running them in compatibility mode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157da83fca08ebc4f9001efd890bbdebb47a7240","amp;dn":"Spoon.net+-+Sandboxed+IE6+IE7+IE8+Standalone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157da83fca08ebc4f9001efd890bbdebb47a7240","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,125,168,63,202,8,235,196,249,0,30,253,137,11,189,235,180,122,114,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
