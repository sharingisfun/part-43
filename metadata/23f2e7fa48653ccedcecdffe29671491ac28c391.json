Taking material harking back from 1970s Time and a Word to 1980s Drama, Virgil Howe (and son of Yes guitarist Steve Howe) re-imagined Yess music into a techno context, dramatically altering the bands sound. \n\nFrom the liner notes:\n\nThen came the moment of truth: playing the Heart Of The Sunrise remix to my highly critical, all-constructive Dad. He listened intently, with a slightly bemused look on his face, until the end, when he smiled and said, You're crazy -why don't you do some more?\n\n-Virgil Howe\n\nI have been a Yes fan for nearly 30 years and probably would have passed on this if it wasn't endorsed by Steve Howe.\n\nMixed with vinyl.  Interesting stuff... \n\nElektra/Rhino R2 73872\n\nRipped to .FLAC using dBpoweramp in Ultra Secure Mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23f2e7fa48653ccedcecdffe29671491ac28c391","amp;dn":"YES+Remixes+by+Virgil+Howe+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23f2e7fa48653ccedcecdffe29671491ac28c391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,242,231,250,72,101,60,206,220,236,223,254,41,103,20,145,172,40,195,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
