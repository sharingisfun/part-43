The Emperor of Zeenu mistakes him for a genius and appoints him for a Super High Royal Supreme Advisor, the jealous Dorkus vows to destroy him, and he befriends a space chimp. Viewers: 3.5 million[1] Note: Otis and Pig from Back at the Barnyard make a cameo appearance in Sheen's dream. Also, Aseefa could be a homage to Neytiri from Avatar, the 2009 film. This is also the only episode so far to show Sheen wearing his trademark Ultra Lord t-shirt (All other episodes so far show him wearing a jacket of some sort, the emperor most likely gave it to him)\n\n\nNOTE-This is a upload of my previous post, this has been converted to mp4 format instead of avi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:745a062921668872225bf3d36b775d81868e0a0e","amp;dn":"Planet+Sheen+S01E01-mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"745a062921668872225bf3d36b775d81868e0a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,90,6,41,33,102,136,114,34,91,243,211,107,119,93,129,134,142,10,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
