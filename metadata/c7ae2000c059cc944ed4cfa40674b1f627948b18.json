They are also affectionately referred to as 'Col and Frank' or 'The Two Men'. They are perhaps most famous for their stand-up comedy and slapstick theatre, as well as their television show The Adventures of Lano and Woodley, which aired on the ABC network in 1997 and 1999. In 1994 they won the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Perrier Comedy Award. They have written one book, Housemeeting, published in 1996. Their final show was performed in Melbourne on November 11, 2006. -wikipedia\n\nQuote: Frank: Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will only cause permanent psychological damage.\n\n\nLano &amp; Woodley [Live] - Goodbye.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 1 063 Kbps\nLength            : 720 MiB for 1h 34mn 40s 760ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 908 Kbps\nAspect            : 592 x 336 (1.762) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 142 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ae2000c059cc944ed4cfa40674b1f627948b18","amp;dn":"Lano+%26+Woodley-Goodbye+%28Live+in+Melbourne+Australia+2006%29DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ae2000c059cc944ed4cfa40674b1f627948b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,174,32,0,192,89,204,148,78,212,207,164,6,116,177,246,39,148,139,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
