But lack of sleep is the least of his worries. Each night he stays awake, Ralph witnesses more and more terrifying activity in his neighborhood. But is any of it real? Ralph isn't sure. All he knows is that the bizarre visions he's been having keep getting more intense, the strange deaths in Derry have just begun, and if he's not hallucinating, everybody in town is in serious trouble.\n\n&quot;So packed with suspense, romance, literary reference, fascinating miscellaneous knowledge, and heart that only Stephen Kind could have written it.&quot; --Booklist\n\nReader Eli Wallach has acted in numerous productions on and off-Broadway during his long, award-winning career, and won a Tony Award for his role in \n&quot;The Rose Tattoo&quot;. He has been nominated for four Emmy awards and has won an Emmy and a BAFTA award. His films include the classics &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;. \n\nUnabridged. 25-3/4 hours from 21 CDs at 128 kbps in MP3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1ac200f61a4efb72d59b923878ef767f4cb524","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Insomnia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1ac200f61a4efb72d59b923878ef767f4cb524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,26,194,0,246,26,78,251,114,213,155,146,56,120,239,118,127,76,181,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
