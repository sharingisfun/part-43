Play the famous Console game on your PC with enhanced graphics and block-rocking beats. Lumines is an addictive and stylish musical puzzler that promises to transcend any puzzle game to date. It delivers a unique gameplay experience that gives players the chance to bust blocks while grooving to evolving musical scores of rock, techno, and pop grooves. Advance through 44 action-packed levels, each with its own musical theme and sound effects and unlock new skins and avatars as you progress.\n\n\nGame Features:\n\n* Challenge Mode - Play Lumines and unlock new skins and music\n* Skin Edit Mode - Customize your Lumines experience by creating your own play\n  list with your favorite skins\n* Time Attack Mode - Test your skills and see how many blocks you can erase in a\n  given amount of time\n* Puzzle Mode - Twist your brain to create indicated shapes using the falling\n  blocks\n* Mission Mode - Clear all the blocks within a certain number of moves\n\nThis release (Base+Advance Pack) contains a total 37 characters, 50 missions, 100 puzzles and 44 skins (levels).\n\n\nExtras:\n\n4 Hi-Res Icons (256x256 PNG compressed)\n\n\nController Input Fix (LumiNoGP.exe):\n\nOn some systems the game is unplayable; the menu scrolls up or down by itself and the blocks are stuck to the side of the screen. I've modified the exe so it runs without Gamepad support, this (hopefully temporary) fixes the problem until they figure it out.\n\n\nIf you want to backup your Save Game, you can find it in the following directories:\n\n* Windows XP: &quot;%AllUsersProfile%\\Application Data\\Valve\\Lumines&quot;\n* Vista &amp; Windows 7: &quot;%ProgramData%\\Valve\\Lumines&quot;\n\n\nInstall: Extract &amp; Play\n\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6dd002ad3e8866c1a3d3d45f6ce47328d7fa12e","amp;dn":"Lumines+Puzzle+Fusion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6dd002ad3e8866c1a3d3d45f6ce47328d7fa12e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,221,0,42,211,232,134,108,26,61,61,69,246,206,71,50,141,127,161,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
