Talk about a recipe for certain disaster, even without being the targets for assassination.\n\nFor after centuries of torment, a fearsome demon walks in the sunlight--freed at last to slay the innocent and devour their souls. But his ultimate goal is Rachel Morgan, and in the fight for survival that follows, even embracing her own demonic nature may not be enough to save her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34fc0ea60bfe4f6f3624799a1dcbdc896dafd2ec","amp;dn":"Pale+Demon+%28The+Hollows+%2F+Rachel+Morgan%2C+Book+9%29+Kim+Harrison","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34fc0ea60bfe4f6f3624799a1dcbdc896dafd2ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,252,14,166,11,254,79,111,54,36,121,154,29,203,220,137,109,175,210,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
