They shared a love of melody, the Sixties, fast Ramones-influenced guitars and the pop sensibility of Buzzcocks and Orange Juice. The band was formed in 1985 by Keiron McDermott (vocals), PJ Court (born Paul Jonathan Court) (vocals, guitar), Steve Dullaghan (bass) and Pete Tweedie (drums). McDermott was soon replaced by vocalist Tracy Tracy (born Tracy Cattell). Tig Williams replaced Pete Tweedie on drums, October '87.\n\n\nThis album contains some cool demos you may not have heard. The Primitives ROCK, so buy their CDs if you like this!
