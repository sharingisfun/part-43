Even for the time period it is weaker than the albums surrounding it. Nine Lives rocked harder, and Honkin' On Bobo was just a killer blues romp. \n\nThe demon of Screamin' Steven Tyler is in full swing here. Some of the best vocals of his career are laid down. 'Beyond Beautiful' and 'Fly Away From Here' show his vocals sore. \n\nWhile their are only a handful of classic guitar riffs ('Jaded' title track, 'Trip Hoppin') which is a real bummer because Joe Perry is known for laying down some smokin' riffs. But that's alright because he plays fantastic leads and a ton of rad solo's. 'Light Inside' features one of his all time best wha-wha induced solos. Whitford also plays great rhythm with Tom Hamilton on bass and Joey Kramer on the sticks. \n\nAnother fantastic thing about Just Push Play is Tyler's knack for rhyming anything with anything else. Fabulous here. \n\nBut what brings Just Push Play down is the fact that it is beyond over produced. Something like 121 tracks were used in the recording of the album. That is outrageous. It sounds so fluffy and un-rock n' roll. Other than that it is really a great album to listen to, and a nice addition to any Aerosmith collection. \n\nby Morton\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Beyond Beautiful.wma                              \n02 - Just Push Play.wma                                \n03 - Jaded.wma                                         \n04 - Fly Away From Here.wma                            \n05 - Trip Hoppin'.wma                                  \n06 - Sunshine.wma                                      \n07 - Under My Skin.wma                                 \n08 - Luv Lies.wma                                      \n09 - Outta Your Head.wma                               \n10 - Drop Dead Gorgeous.wma                            \n11 - Light Inside.wma                                  \n12 - Avant Garden.wma                                  \n13 - Face.wma                \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nMARCELODRGZ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9535c75d80224bad8b7d533a87d316eed089655","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Just+Push+Play+%282001%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9535c75d80224bad8b7d533a87d316eed089655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,83,92,117,216,2,36,186,216,183,213,51,168,125,49,110,237,8,150,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
