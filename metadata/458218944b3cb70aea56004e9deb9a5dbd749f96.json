I wanted to make a rootsy blues record and remind people that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not from England or Greece, which some fans may think. Getting some earthy grit on the tracks was important, but at the same time, I wanted to make a blues album that was different. Basically, I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to compete with myself. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf you listen to my last few albums, you hear a progression. Last year, though, I did an about-face and made a big rock record with Black Country Communion. Obviously, I knew I shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try to out-rock that! [laughs] But I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to repeat what I had already done solo-wise. So I had to look for new places creativelyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦mentally, spiritually. It was challenging. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA few people have remarked to me that Dust Bowl sounds more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“mature,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and I thought, Well, I made my last record a year agoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not that much older!\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy seed &amp; comment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:458218944b3cb70aea56004e9deb9a5dbd749f96","amp;dn":"Joe+Bonamassa-Dust+Bowl-%282011%29-%28MP3-V0%29-%28CD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"458218944b3cb70aea56004e9deb9a5dbd749f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,130,24,148,75,60,183,10,234,86,0,78,157,235,154,93,189,116,159,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
