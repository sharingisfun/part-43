Moritz Productions(2009). Length : 107min               \n\n\n Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to  \n blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through     \n the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con   \n Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are    \n forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an          \n uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists  \n to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find     \n the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the   \n wheel.                                                                       \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
