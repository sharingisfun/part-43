Written by Alan Ayckbourn; Full cast dramatisation starring Robin Herford, Diane Bull, Simon Jones, Tessa Peake-Jones and Jon Strickland; Adapted by Neville Teller; Directed by Gordon House.\n\nWhen the deviously amorous Norman plans a clandestine weekend away with his sister-in-law, he has some fun and games in mind. But not quite the fun and games that he gets...\n\nThis trilogy can be played in any order and each part takes place concurrently. Part one is set in the dining room, part two in the living room, and part three moves to the garden.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79eac542beeb4bf0104f14b780910255310722df","amp;dn":"Alan+Ayckbourn+-+The+Norman+Conquests+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79eac542beeb4bf0104f14b780910255310722df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,234,197,66,190,235,75,240,16,79,20,183,128,145,2,85,49,7,34,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
