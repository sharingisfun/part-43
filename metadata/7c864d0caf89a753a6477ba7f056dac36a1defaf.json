The groove is very hard and funky, with tight drumbreaks and excellent basslines that you'd hardly expect to find on an album by a blues artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ jamming around with a tight groove that really makes us love the record! The guitar on the set is wonderfully scratchy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ripping up and down over heavy drums, with some nice horn touches to flesh the sound up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and wicked vocals from Hook that give the whole set a nice and nasty feel! The best cuts include &quot;Make It Funky&quot;, &quot;713 Blues&quot;, &quot;714 Blues&quot;, and &quot;Bluebird&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the record's got some very nice breaks!\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
