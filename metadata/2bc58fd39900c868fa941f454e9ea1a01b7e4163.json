His films, especially the dark and magical clay animations he created for musician Frank Zappa in the 1970s, have achieved cult status worldwide, even though very little of his 40 year body of work has been edited or released to the public.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397538/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397538/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.brettingram.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.brettingram.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis was pretty hard to find, so please SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc58fd39900c868fa941f454e9ea1a01b7e4163","amp;dn":"Monster+Road+-+Documentary+about+Bruce+Bickford+%28DVDRip+-+XviD%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc58fd39900c868fa941f454e9ea1a01b7e4163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,197,143,211,153,0,200,104,250,148,31,69,78,158,161,160,27,126,65,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
