The Belle of the Ball \n\n\nRoddy Frame, a native of East Kilbride near Glasgow, Scotland, formed AZTEC CAMERA in 1980. During 1992 Roddy worked on the fifth AZTEC CAMERA album in New York with producer/musician Ryuichi Sakamoto. The album DREAMLAND was released May 17th 1993. \nThe music is gentle and for the most part romantic, but not annoying. At times melancholy, at times provocative; you'll hear romantic ballads and soulful Jazz, or upbeat fun tunes. Lyrics are never boring or superficial but deep and purposeful. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 2\nArtist: Aztec Camera\nAlbum: Dreamland\nYear: 1993\nGenre: Pop\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9419cb99b065c3e66d4b9efd82decc6a664ea19","amp;dn":"Aztec+Camera+-+Dreamland+%5BFLAC-1993%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9419cb99b065c3e66d4b9efd82decc6a664ea19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,65,156,185,155,6,92,62,102,212,185,239,216,45,236,198,166,100,234,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
