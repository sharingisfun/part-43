Astronaut rescuers recover only one green-skinned survivor - a female with insatiably vampire-like appetites. Genre director Curtis Harrington crafted this B-movie marvel with footage from the Russian film &quot;Niebo Zowiet.&quot; John Saxon, Basil Rathbone, Dennis Hopper, Judi Meredith and horror publisher Forrest J. Ackerman star.\n\nOther Notes:\n\nQueen of Blood is widely cited (nowadays) as an influence on the script of Alien. \n\nThe special effects footage is mostly lifted from the Russian sci-fi film mentioned above, but it is spectacular - really colorful and trippy.\n\nA weird and interesting movie.\n\nA baby-faced Dennis Hopper is worth seeing. Also, the ending is a little creepy.\n\nSource:\n\nDigital TV capture, 720x480 16:9 NTSC 23.976 fps DivX encoded with TMPGEnc Xpress 4.0.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e516d585e2eb4440bf785f6bb61338cd85951fb0","amp;dn":"Queen+Of+Blood+%281966%29+Sci-Fi.Horror+RIP+Dennis+Hopper.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e516d585e2eb4440bf785f6bb61338cd85951fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,22,213,133,226,235,68,64,191,120,95,107,182,19,56,205,133,149,31,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
