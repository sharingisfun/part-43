Good (at least TV) quality.  Enjoy!\n\n01 \tMind Controlled Car\nOur team of inventors attempts to prototype a car that utilizes biofeedback sensors to restrict a car's performance as its driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s agitation level increases. Joe and Zoz will use cutting edge biofeedback and mind control technologies as the brains of the prototypes while Terry and Mike retrofit the test cars for an extreme test to prove the concept: a demolition derby where road rage is inevitable.\n\n02 \tBoxing robots \t\nThe prototype team looks into the future of gaming ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and giant, boxing robots are what they see. Joe and Zoz utilize a technology called optical glyph tracking to allow the robots to register and mimic their human counterpartsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ boxing movements, while Mike is charged with dressing the metallic skeletons and Terry with building the metal beasts themselves. And then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s into the boxing ring for a metallic monster slugfest!\n\n03 \tTraffic Busting Truck \t\nThe boys take on the challenge of building a car that will beat traffic by rising up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and driving over it. And as an added bonus, the lift allows the vehicle to find parking like nothing else on wheels. The key to this build is a set of amazing wheels that can move in all directions without actually turning.\n\n04 \tSix-Legged All Terrain Vehicle \t\nInspired by the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlegsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of an innovative robot called RHex, the prototypers decide to use this basic design with its synchronized alternating tripod gait and build it BIG! What first appears as a simple upscaling project becomes a real challenge when the team discovers that size can change everything.\n\n05 \tBackyard Waterslide Simulator \t\nNo water theme park is complete without a long run on a water slide, but what do you do when you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the room in your backyard? Let the laws of physics give you a ride! In what may be their most massive build, the team puts together an amazing, fun-filled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslide-in-a-ringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and then turns on the hose for some aquatic fun.\n\n06 \tFirefighter Future Tech \t\nThe team tries to revolutionize firefighting equipment. As they learned, hauling the heavy fire equipment up flights of stairs leaves firefighters tired, and with less oxygen in their tank. One of their challenges was to build a &quot;Stairbot&quot; to carry the equipment, and then convert into a rescue seat. The second challenge the team faced was to design an ergonomical &quot;PyroPack&quot; that would give our flamebustin' heroes the chance to save even more lives.\n\n07 \tGet Up And Go \t\nThe team of engineers attempts to invent a space-age sleeping pod that gets you up, fed, showered, groomed, dressed, informed and out the door in a matter of minutes. Initial attempts to automate things like shaving and eating turn out to be either scary or messy, but some surprising breakthroughs pave the way for a triumphant public demonstration.\n\n08 \tAutomated Pizza Delivery \t\nThe team attempts to build an automated pizza delivery robot and automated pizza delivery car (see: driverless car), but only after scary attempts with massive blimps.\n\n09 \tWearable Airbag \t\nThe team attempts to invent a wearable airbag to protect construction workers in case they fall from high-rises.\n\n10 \tVirtual Sea Adventure \t\nThe team attempts to invent a telepresence deep sea diving experience.\n\n11 \tFlying Life Guard \t\nThe team tries to develop two flying-lifeguard systems to protect swimmers on unguarded beaches.\n\n12 \tGecko Superhero Suit \t\nThe team attemps to invent two devices for humans to scale a smooth vertical surface and to scale a rough vertical surface like a gecko does, calling the human either &quot;Geckoman&quot; or &quot;Geckowoman.&quot;\n\n13 \tRobo Dog Sitter \t\nThe team of inventors attempts to engineer the world's first robotic dog sitter. Designed to play with, let out and discipline your dog, the Robo Dog Sitter will also allow an owner at work to communicate with his dog via a monitor on the robot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e13f2cf7678ac236aaea0c5d946cc2fa7e9f68bf","amp;dn":"Prototype+This+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e13f2cf7678ac236aaea0c5d946cc2fa7e9f68bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,63,44,247,103,138,194,54,170,234,12,93,148,108,194,250,126,159,104,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
