He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals &quot;escape&quot; in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.\n\nPlease seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d2f74c7cc30b31dea2811f5f904bbb7d4046d70","amp;dn":"Shutter+Island+%282010%29+DVDScreen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d2f74c7cc30b31dea2811f5f904bbb7d4046d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,47,116,199,204,48,179,29,234,40,17,245,249,4,187,183,212,4,109,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
