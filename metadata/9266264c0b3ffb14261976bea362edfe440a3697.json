The band's members are Mark Morriss on vocals, Adam Devlin on guitar, Scott Morriss on bass guitar, and Eds Chesters on drums. A fifth member, Richard Payne, came on board between 1998 and 2002. The band was originally named &quot;The Bottlegarden&quot;.\n\nThe band's biggest hit, &quot;Slight Return&quot;, was released in 1995 (as a double A-side with &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;) and re-released on its own the following year. They have achieved thirteen Top 40 singles and three Top 10 albums in the UK charts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bluetones' commercial success waned after the fall of the Britpop movement, yet they have continued to tour and release new records and are therefore often labelled as &quot;Britpop survivors&quot;.\n\nIn September 2008, the band announced that they would be embarking on a five-date tour in December, taking in Lincoln, Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham. The tour saw them playing their debut album, Expecting to Fly, in full. Some further dates were subsequently announced for February and March 2009.\n\nThe band's next album called A New Athens will be released on 31 May 2010.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - The Notes Between The Notes Be\n02 - Firefly\n03 - A New Athens\n04 - Culling Song\n05 - Into The Red\n06 - Golden Soul\n07 - The Day That Never Was\n08 - Carry Me Home\n09 - Half The Size Of Nothing\n10 - Haunted By You\n11 - Pranchestonelle\n12 - Hey Schmoopy (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bluetones&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bluetones&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thebluetones.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thebluetones.info/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; AS ALWAYS: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9266264c0b3ffb14261976bea362edfe440a3697","amp;dn":"The+Bluetones+-+A+New+Athens+%282010%29%28Indie+Rock++Alt.+Rock+Britpo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9266264c0b3ffb14261976bea362edfe440a3697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,102,38,76,11,63,251,20,38,25,118,190,163,98,237,254,68,10,54,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
