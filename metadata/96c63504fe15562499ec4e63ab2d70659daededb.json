The type of man you shared a flat with. The blokes you play golf with. The type of guy you share your deepest secret with over a beer. It's a magazine about real blokes and the things that occupy a real guy's mind, groin, heart, body and soul. It dispenses useful information about fitness, health, sex and nutrition with humour, a wink and, occasionally, a kick in butt. You see, blokes need something they can look at, point at, something that says this is what it's like to be a man. You know, like instructions, maybe. Something a guy can pick up and look at, learn from, live by.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c63504fe15562499ec4e63ab2d70659daededb","amp;dn":"Men%5C%27s+Health+-+March+2011+%28UK%29%40Mastitorrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c63504fe15562499ec4e63ab2d70659daededb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,198,53,4,254,21,86,36,153,236,78,99,171,45,112,101,157,174,222,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
