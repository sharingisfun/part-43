Some, like the surging \n&quot;My City in Ruins&quot; and the melancholy &quot;Empty Sky&quot; largely \neschew metaphor, while others approach the situation from more \noblique angles.\n\n&quot;Mary's Place&quot; is a rousing roots-rocker about finding joy in \nthe face of sadness, while both the Eastern-flavored &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; \nand the homegrown &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot; address the need for \ncommunication and understanding between disparate entities.\n\nMusically, many of THE RISING's songs are in wide-screen, \nanthemic mode, as Bruce and company attempt to rally their wounded \ncountry with positivity and clear-eyed optimism without shrinking \nfrom unpleasant reality. \n\nThe interstitial ballads take the poignant storytelling mode \nSpringsteen employed on his last new album, 1995's THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD, \nand apply it to THE RISING's more universal themes. Whatever the format,\nthe enthusiastic camaraderie of the E Streeters and their Boss is audible \nand infectious.\n\n_____________________________________\n\n1. Lonesome Day\n   \n2.
