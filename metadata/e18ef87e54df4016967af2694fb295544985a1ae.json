It displayed his facility with the blues, speed, gospel influence and interpretative abilities on such songs as John Lewis' &quot;Django&quot; and Clifford Brown's &quot;Daahoud.&quot;  It also contained Bryant's funky originals &quot;Splittin&quot; and &quot;Blues Changes,&quot; and was punctuated by Ike Isaacs' careful bass work and Specs Wright's loose, in the groove drumming.  This set has recently been reissued by Fantasy, and the remastering provides a fine sonic framework for Bryant's heady, unpredictable, and often exciting playing.\n\nRay Bryant is a great blues pianist, yet this early recording has only one blues piece on it - and the album is still one of the best he ever made. BLUES CHANGES is the blues composition, and it's done slow and way down-home. The best tune on the album, however, is SPLITTIN, an up-tempo swinger. Bryant works well with Isaacs and Wright - the drummer uses a very light touch, especially with the brushes. The CD is a great success. Highly recommended. ~ Bomojaz\n\nPersonnel:\nRay Bryant Trio\nRay Bryant - piano\nIke Isaacs - bass\nCharles 'Specs' Wright - drums\n\nRay Bryant - Ray Bryant Trio Track Listing:\n01  Golden Earrings\n02  Angel Eyes\n03  Blues Changes\n04  Splittin'\n05  Django\n06  The Thrill Is Gone\n07  Daahoud\n08  Sonar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e18ef87e54df4016967af2694fb295544985a1ae","amp;dn":"Ray+Bryant+-+Ray+Bryant+Trio+%281957%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e18ef87e54df4016967af2694fb295544985a1ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,142,248,126,84,223,64,22,150,122,242,105,79,178,149,84,73,133,161,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
