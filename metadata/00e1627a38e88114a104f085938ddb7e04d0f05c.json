She remains rooted in the singer/songwriter tradition, meaning she writes for the discerning listener rather than the oversexed club attendee, yet Marina nevertheless welcomes elements of glammed-up rock into the album's best songs. &quot;Afterparty at Jimmy's&quot; builds its foundation on electric guitar and booming snare hits, with Marina's snarky commentary on the SoCal hipster lifestyle (&quot;So you say you've got a band? Mmm! Three parts Kinks and one part the Jam?&quot;) providing the snarky icing on the cake. Several tracks earlier, &quot;Move You (SSSPII)&quot; opens the disc with soft croons before careening into stomp-clap percussion and quick harmonies, while &quot;All the Same to Me&quot; pairs thudding drums with neo-jazz instrumentation. Anya Marina sounds coolly cocky throughout, whether she's asserting her dominance over an intended partner (&quot;one of these days, you'll be falling for the least of my moves&quot;) or speaking Spanish during a cover of &quot;Waters of March (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½guas de MarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§o).&quot; This may not be the same girl who bemoaned her average-ness in Miss Halfway's title track, but the new Marina is much more fun. ~ Andrew Leahey, All Music Guide\n\nNote\nAnya Marina - Move You (Live Jimmy Kimmel 2009) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4752867&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4752867&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4735271&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4735271&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- QuietGeek\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e1627a38e88114a104f085938ddb7e04d0f05c","amp;dn":"Anya.Marina-Slow.%26.Steady.Seduction.Phase.II.CD.mp3-QG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e1627a38e88114a104f085938ddb7e04d0f05c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,225,98,122,56,232,129,20,161,4,240,133,147,141,219,126,4,208,240,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
