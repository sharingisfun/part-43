Pirate Bay sometimes tends to be a few days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html (ch = Switzerland, but the server can be somewhere else).  The bad guys can put up blocks to all HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!\n\nHTTP download mirror at http://alexlibman.com/dl/wikileaks/.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db1278dc0a10780eff5bab992a8e3e5d34aea2ad","amp;dn":"WikiLeaks+CableGate+update+for+Jan+28th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db1278dc0a10780eff5bab992a8e3e5d34aea2ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,18,120,220,10,16,120,14,255,91,171,153,42,142,62,93,52,174,162,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
