The diagrams guide the reader, step-by-step, from the basics of relativity to advanced topics including the addition of velocities, Lorentz contraction, time dilation, the twin paradox, Doppler shift, and Einstein's famous equation E=mc. The distinctive figures throughout the book enable the reader to visualize the theory in a way that cannot be fully conveyed through equations alone. \n\nThe illustrative explanations in this book maintain the logic and rigour necessary for physics students, yet are simple enough to be understood by non-scientists. The book also contains entertaining problems which challenge the reader's understanding of the materials covered\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n\n\nPS: If you have an ORIGINAL (non &quot;for dummies&quot;) E-book request Feel free to post\nit below.
