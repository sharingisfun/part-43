Throughout CCR's brief career, their sound was a musical evocation of a mythic rural South, and Willy and the Poor Boys is arguably the most Southern-sounding of all their records. Even though this t10-song album is padded out with cover versions of such folk-blues standards as &quot;Cotton Fields&quot; and &quot;The Midnight Special,&quot; John and brother Tom Fogerty's ragged electric guitar playing and the minimalist bass and drum work of Stu Cook and Doug Clifford make these well-known songs sound like Creedence originals.\n\nTracklist\n1.
