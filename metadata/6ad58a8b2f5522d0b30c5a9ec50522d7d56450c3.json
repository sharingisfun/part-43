Her final performance, in fact, took place in Lowell, cradle of the industrial revolution. Long before that tragic set, however, Holiday recorded a series of shows at George WeinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legendary Boston club Storyville. \n\n\n\nThough separated by two years from 1951-53, these discreet recordings capture &quot;Lady Day&quot; in prime emotive voice. From the first of Carl DrunkardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s watery piano drops which open &quot;I Cover The Waterfront&quot; to Sten GetzÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s peppy sax supports in the abbreviated closer &quot;YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Driving Me Crazy,&quot; Holiday evokes a wide palette of feels and feelings. \n\n\n\n&quot;AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t NobodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Business If I Do&quot; depicts an eerily realistic abusive relationship with disturbingly defiant laissez faire. GershwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true classic &quot;I Love You, Porgy,&quot; on the other hand, places Holiday in the position of a lover afraid of losing the one man who treats her right.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, Holiday also cries, creaks and slurs her way through such signatures as &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You,&quot; Johnny MercerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Too Marvelous For Words&quot; and her self-penned &quot;BillieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blues.&quot; Despite 24-bit remastering, the recordings retain the production value of their original platters. Even so, the CD is a historic record.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n\n\n\n01. You're Driving Me Crazy (Donaldson) 1:32\n02. Lover Come Back To Me (Romberg-Hammerstein) 2:20\n03.
