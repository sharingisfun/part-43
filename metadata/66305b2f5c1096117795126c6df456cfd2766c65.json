I thought about how we have built entire cities of artificial light as refuge from the dark. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nVideo treats light like water ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it becomes a fluid on the video tube.\nWater supports the fish like light supports man. Land is the death of the fish. Darkness is the death of man. Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nBill Viola, 1981\n\nHatsu-Yume (First Dream) is Bill ViolaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s masterpiece, the greatest work by one of the most important video artists in the world. A spiritual allegory equating light and dark with life and death. Hatsu-Yume was produced in Japan in 1981 while Viola was artist-in-residence at the Sony Corporation. The title refers to Japanese folklore, wherein things done on the first day of a new year are significant. But the tape is not to be taken literally as a dream. For Viola, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more like the aboriginal concept of dreamtime, the creation of the world. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why, as a whole and in its parts, Hatsu-Yume progresses from darkness to light, stillness to motion, silence to sound, simplicity to complexity, nature to civilization. There are two interwoven themes: the dark water world of fish, and Buddhist rituals invoking the souls of dead ancestors. As in a dream, we frequently canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell if these wordless streams of image and sound are unfolding in real time, slow-motion or time-lapse. A work of extravagant pictorial beauty, Hatsu-Yume represents the most painterly use of light in the history of video. Form is content: the light that lures fish to their death protects human life. At once ominous, majestic, mystical and deeply spiritual, Hatsu-Yume is the work of a visionary poet of image and sound.\n\nGene Youngblood\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66305b2f5c1096117795126c6df456cfd2766c65","amp;dn":"Bill+Viola+-+Hatsu+Yume+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66305b2f5c1096117795126c6df456cfd2766c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,48,91,47,92,16,150,17,119,149,18,108,109,244,86,207,210,118,108,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
