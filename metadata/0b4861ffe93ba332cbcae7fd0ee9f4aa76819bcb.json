I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going \\&quot;Hey, did you hear the new blah blah...\\&quot; So, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out.  Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. \n\nThis music is a lot more Indie stuff, with Electro-Pop, Dance, Rap, Folk all in one mix-tape.\n\nSince this is the first tape, there are some older songs on here, but will become strictly new in the upcoming months. \n\nAdele - Rolling In The Deep (Jamie XX Remix) ft.
