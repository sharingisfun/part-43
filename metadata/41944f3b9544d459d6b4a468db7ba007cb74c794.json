Did the younger Prince Richard survive? Is he an imposter or is he, as he says 'King Richard IV?&quot;\n\nA dramatised account of one of the possible theories surrounding a man who, in the late 1400s, claimed to be heir to the throne and brother of then-queen Elizabeth of York. But is this man an impostor to the throne of Henry VII or is there truth to his claim that he didn't die 16 years before?\n\nA meticulously researched piece of work with beautifully rounded characters that follow the historical events and evidence ie not the Tudor spin, in a roller-coaster ride of absolute excellence. All of history's archetypes and stereotypes have been laid to rest, particularly Richard III. Mark Umbers plays a mesmerising Perkin Warbeck and his famous line to describe his father's (Edward IV's) character which I won't repeat here (I want you to enjoy it for yourselves when it comes) is one of the best lines I've heard. A masterpiece! \n\nCast:\nMark Umbers: Perkin Warbeck\nNadia Cameron-Blakey: Queen Elizabeth\nPaul Hilton: Henry VII\nRoger Hammond: Bishop De Cambrai\nJohn Castle: Dr. Argentine\nSally Edwards: Margaret Beaufort\nNicholas Rowe: Ambassador\nTimotei Cresta: Edward V aged 12\nCorrentin Combeau: Richard aged 10\n\nSize: 699 MB + 696 MB\nRunning Time: 0:53:54.600 + 0:58:09.280\nFormat: Avi, 672 x 384\nAspect Ratio: 1.750 (7:4)\nVideo Codec: XviD (XviD 1.1.2 Final)\nVideo Info: Frames/s 25.000, 1581 kbps\nAudio: English\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 CBR\nAudio Info: 48000Hz 224 kb/s, stereo (2/0)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41944f3b9544d459d6b4a468db7ba007cb74c794","amp;dn":"Princes+in+the+Tower+%282005%29+DVDRip-XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41944f3b9544d459d6b4a468db7ba007cb74c794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,148,79,59,149,68,212,89,214,180,164,104,219,123,160,7,203,116,199,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
