Havingfounded the innovative and influential Hotflush\nRecordings label in 2003, he has continually brought colour and depth\nto an advancing genre, expanding its sonic structure and increasing its\ninfluence on the wider electronic scene. Through Scuba and seminal work\nby central figures including Distance, Vexd and more recently Mount\nKimbie and Joy Orbison, Hotflush remains crucial to the immediate\nmoment and the developing future of the most exciting aspects of\nelectronic music. Following the first Scuba LP, A Mutual Antipathy\n(2008), and the more recent Aesaunic EP (2009), this album takes the\nScuba sound to a new level. The collision of dubstep and techno has\nproduced startling music from a wide range of producers in the last few\nyears, none more than Scuba, and that has been well documented. But\nTriangulation moves past the dubstep/techno axis and into new\nterritory. Working at multiple tempos, the album covers an area ranging\nfrom house to experimental drum n bass while retaining the Scuba sound\nthat has become so distinctive. You Got Me and So You Think Youre\nSpecial, released as an advance 12?, reflect the range of the album\nwith the huge bass and frenetic energy of the former contrasting with\nthe melancholic atmospheres and melodies of the latter. The listless\nbeauty of Before, the aggressively percussive Minerals and the\nhyperactive electro of On Deck provide further stylistic variation, but\nthis is not simply a collection of tracks - for the best sonic results\nthis album should be listened to in full.\n\nSeed. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tag/freesun&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tag/freesun&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf300bf7e96a6efa41cc621d2039f45bbabb5bb6","amp;dn":"Scuba+-+Triangulation+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf300bf7e96a6efa41cc621d2039f45bbabb5bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,48,11,247,233,106,110,250,65,204,98,29,32,57,244,91,186,187,91,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
