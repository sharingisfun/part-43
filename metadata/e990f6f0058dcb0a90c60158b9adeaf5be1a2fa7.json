Blessed with skill and talent far exceeding their peers, one can only define what they possess as a gift from the gods. These early portraits are imperative, because both figures have been so canonized that it is easy to forget the significance of their gifts. \nThe story of Jazz is told in ten parts, lasting a total of 19 hours. Each section covers a time period, providing biographies of important figures and covering social developments within that time. Episode 1 titled, &quot;Gumbo,&quot; explores the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The most musical of American cities during the 19th century, the viewer learns of cultural and musical ingredients that went into the &quot;gumbo&quot; that would become jazz. Jazz provides biographies of notable artists like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, which are told over a number of episodes. This allows the viewer to see the full career of these giantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not just the parts where they were &quot;in style.&quot; Jazz is also a social document, continually reminding the viewer of the segregation and prejudice that have been inflicted against African Americans within American society\n\nCredits\nKen BurnsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Director/Producer/Cinematography\nLynn Novick--Producer\nGeoffrey C.
