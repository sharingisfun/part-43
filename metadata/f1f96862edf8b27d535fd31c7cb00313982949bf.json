He discovers our sense of time passing and the clocks that drive our bodies. He reveals the forces of time that make and destroy us in a lifetime. He journeys to some of the Earth's most spectacular geological sites to look for clues to the extraordinary depths of time at a planetary level. Finally, he takes us on a cosmic journey in search of the beginning (and the end) of time itself.\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Earth Time\n\nWe hold a unique knowledge of time, realising that it stretches deep into the past, and will continue into the future. How does this affect our sense of who we are?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1f96862edf8b27d535fd31c7cb00313982949bf","amp;dn":"Time+%28BBC+2006+-+Part+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1f96862edf8b27d535fd31c7cb00313982949bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,249,104,98,237,248,178,125,83,95,211,28,124,176,3,19,152,41,73,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
