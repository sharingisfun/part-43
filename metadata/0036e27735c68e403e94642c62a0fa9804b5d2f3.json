Written and produced by Knowles, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, and Rico Love, the track was released as the album's sixth single.\n\nThe song was leaked before the release of I AmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Sasha Fierce under the title &quot;Beautiful Nightmare&quot;. With the release of the album, the song name was changed to its current title, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;. This song was selected as the sixth single from the album as a last-minute replacement for &quot;Broken-Hearted Girl&quot;. The song is used in the commercial Knowles did for Crystal Geyser.\n\n&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; was critically lauded, with critics praising its dark tone and its electropop sound. The Times was impressed with the song: &quot;Sweet Dreams, with its deep bass, and disturbed lyrics, is thrilling.&quot;\n\nMTV calls the song &quot;great,&quot; commenting that &quot;The gnarly low end (which kind of sounds like Michael Jackson's &quot;Beat It&quot; for about half a second), the spare snare kicks, the expansive-yet-molecular chorus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ sonically, it's as adventurous as anything she's ever released. And her vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ icy and cool, slippery like mercury ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ are nothing to scoff at either. \n\nReleased \tJune 2, 2009 (2009-06-02)\nFormat \t\tDigital download, CD single\nRecorded \t2008; South Beat Studios\n\t\t(Miami Beach, Florida)\nGenre \t\tR&amp;B, electropop\nLength \t\t3:28\nLabel \t\tColumbia\nWriter(s) \tBeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Knowles, James Scheffer, Wayne Wilkins, Rico Love\nProducer \tJim Jonsin, Wayne Wilkins, Rico Love, BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Knowles\n\n\nVideo Specs :\n\nFormat: Matroska (.mkv) | AVC\nNominal Bitrate: 2 216 kbps\nOverall Bitrate: 2 387 kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass [Extreme]\nResolution: 1280 x 704\nQuality Factor: 0.098\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 16/9\n\nAudio Specs :\n\nType: Vorbis\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\nChannels: 2 channels\n\nBest Player: KMPlayer\n\nDon't Forget to say a little 'Thank You' and lots of SEEDs! :]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0036e27735c68e403e94642c62a0fa9804b5d2f3","amp;dn":"Sweet+Dreams+%28Beautiful+Nightmare%29-Beyonce+720p+2009+chikezei","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0036e27735c68e403e94642c62a0fa9804b5d2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,54,226,119,53,198,142,64,62,148,100,44,98,160,250,152,4,181,210,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
