Covering both short-reach and long-haul networks, Planning Fiber Optic Networks provides full details on all major fiber optic parameters and includes appropriate background theory and design calculations. You will find guidelines for optimizing SONET/SDH and Ethernet networks, setting up network topologies, minimizing signal loss and impairments, and using dark fiber. Real-world examples are included throughout this practical guide.\n\nUnderstand signal propagation in a single-mode fiber\nPlan an optical loss budget\nMaintain an acceptable optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR)\nLearn about the effects of chromatic dispersion (CD) and polarization mode dispersion (PMD)\nExpand fiber capacity using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)\nReduce fiber nonlinear impairments\nPerform fiber characterization to ensure optimal quality and performance\nTest Ethernet and SONET/SDH networks\nPlan point-to-point and ring fiber topologies\nLease or purchase dark fiber ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189362ea9b2efaa0070dc09220f2cf9617aed79f","amp;dn":"Planning+Fiber+Optics+Networks+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189362ea9b2efaa0070dc09220f2cf9617aed79f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,147,98,234,155,46,250,160,7,13,192,146,32,242,207,150,23,174,215,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
