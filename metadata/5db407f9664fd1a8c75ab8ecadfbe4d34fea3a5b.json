The two formed The Legion of Doom in 2004 to focus on a series of unique creative projects.\n\nThe first of these projects was Incorporated, a mash-up album featuring mixes of various punk and hardcore bands. The album was completed in 2006, but due to some of the artists unwilling to allow the album to be released,[1] the group intentionally leaked the album onto the P2P Networks.[2] On March 6, 2007 the album was released in physical format through Illegal Art.[3]\n\nThe Legion of Doom has also contributed remixes and original music to film soundtracks such as Underworld: Evolution, Saw II and TV Show[4]. Other projects in the works include the original score and music supervision for independent film &quot;Eyes Front&quot;, an album of original material, and drum and sample sets.\n\nDuring several The Legion Of Doom songs, a male and a female voice can be heard speaking at certain points. These are the voices of Ken and Winnie from the 1950 movie &quot;This Charming Couple&quot;. On the song &quot;Lolita's Medicine&quot; on the album &quot;Incorporated&quot;, the male voice is from a 1967 anti-drug PSA called &quot;Narcotics: Pit of Despair.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5db407f9664fd1a8c75ab8ecadfbe4d34fea3a5b","amp;dn":"Legion+of+Doom+-+Incorporated+%28%2BBonus+tracks%2FB+sides%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5db407f9664fd1a8c75ab8ecadfbe4d34fea3a5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,180,7,249,102,79,209,168,199,90,184,236,173,251,228,211,79,234,58,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
