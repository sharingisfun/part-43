Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...\n\nComix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you\\'re inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.\n\nThe graphics, which were drawn by real comic book artists, give you the sense that youre actually playing a comic. As you fight the good fight, youll see Mortus literally draw new enemies to take you down. If you re able to master some fighting moves and collect a few power-ups, you just might find yourself face-to-face with your own worst creation in the most important fight of your life!\n\nScreenshots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/comix-zone/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/comix-zone/screenshots&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHow To Install The Game:\nDouble-click the Comix Zone PC-Hyperdrive25.exe and follow the instructions.\n\n...................................................................................\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive25.
