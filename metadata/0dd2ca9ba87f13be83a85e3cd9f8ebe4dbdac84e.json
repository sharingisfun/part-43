Her repertoire consists of a mixture of originals, covers, and arrangements of various Northumbrian and North England folk tunes, with the overall tone skewing towards that which is nowadays thought of as Celtic (i.e., listeners will be able to pick out elements that come from Scotland, England, Ireland, and various islands, Hebridean and otherwise). The ultimate truth, of course, is that Tickell is working within a musical framework that has been cross-pollinated for centuries. Her original work, incidentally, is superb; &quot;Our Kate,&quot; written for the late Catherine Cookson (and presented here in two versions) is a gorgeous, moving piece. A fine set indeed, head and shoulders above many such folk releases. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/kathryn-tickell/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dd2ca9ba87f13be83a85e3cd9f8ebe4dbdac84e","amp;dn":"Kathryn+Tickell...Debateable+Lands%282000%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dd2ca9ba87f13be83a85e3cd9f8ebe4dbdac84e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,210,202,155,168,127,19,190,131,168,94,60,217,248,235,228,219,218,200,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
