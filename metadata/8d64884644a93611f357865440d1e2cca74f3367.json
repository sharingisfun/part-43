The stand out track from this first LP outing is &quot;Restrained in a moment&quot; with its layered sound scape and even deeper layered lyrics. Its also the oldest track (first recorded in 1982, this version from 84)and a live favourite retaining the feel of the period.\n\nOn other tracks the producers influence (Peter Hook of New Order) come to the fore alongside his talents as a backing vocalist. \n\nAs with many factory artists promotion was non-existent (you had to find it for yourself) and reviews were equally scarce although a few years later on the London warehouse scene they were often played after dawn as the police turned up! \n\nSide A\n\n        3:50\tI Love You (Restrained in a Moment)\n\t4:05\tVoices\n\t3:46\tMoonfish is Here\n\t4:17\tDark and Light\n\t6:44\tRadio Egypt\n\nRunout &quot;The Mark of the Donkey&quot;\n\nSide B\n\n\t4:05\tDiscipline\n\t3:30\tThe Dawn Song\n\t4:02\tRitual 1\n\t5:10\tPower of Will\n\t5:42\tMotherland\n\nRunout &quot;Aaaargh!

As usual played on my Pro-Ject deck, restored in Adobe Audition and presented as a 256kbps mp3.\n\nShare and enjoy (apart from DJs *)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* [note for DJs, when handling an irreplaceable record that's older than you, keep your sweaty paws off the grooves! A punch in the face often offends :[ There is a reason the old school wear cotton gloves and it aint respect for MJ}\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d64884644a93611f357865440d1e2cca74f3367","amp;dn":"The+Royal+Family+and+the+Poor+-+The+temple+of+the+13th+tribe+-+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d64884644a93611f357865440d1e2cca74f3367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,100,136,70,68,169,54,17,243,87,134,84,64,209,226,204,167,79,51,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
