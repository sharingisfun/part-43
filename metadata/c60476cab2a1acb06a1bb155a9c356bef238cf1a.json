Other actors featured include Barry Foster,\nVincent Ball, Harold Goodwin, Ray McAnally and Percy Herbert.\n\nDirected by Guy Green and written by Robert Westerby, the film is set in\nNorth Africa during World War II and tells the story of a patrol of the Long\nRange Desert Group (LRDG), commandos who drove long distances\nbehind enemy lines in the fight against Rommel's Afrika Korps. The film's\ntechnical advisor was Bill Kennedy Shaw, who served as the group's\nintelligence officer during the desert campaign.\n\nThe score was by Clifton Parker and was performed by the Sinfonia of\nLondon under the musical direction of Muir Mathieson.\n\nMany consider it to be a fairly accurate description of a typical LRDG\npatrol. One glaring mistake however is the troops' use of Sten guns which\nwere never issued to or used by LRDG, who used either the SMLE .303\nor the Thompson submachine gun.\n\nIt was filmed entirely in Tripolitania, Libya.\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nOn the eve of the Battle of El Alamein, Captain Tim Cotton leads a LRDG\npatrol on a raid to destroy a German fuel dump located deep behind\nenemy lines. After surviving a perilous journey, they arrive and destroy\nthe stocks of petrol, only to find a secret inside the depot. With their radio\nsmashed in a German ambush, they must return to base to report the\ninformation while there is time for it to be acted upon.\n\n\n\n* Michael Craig as Captain Tim Cotton\n\n* John Gregson as Captain Bill Williams R.E.\n\n* Richard Attenborough as Trooper Brody\n\n* Percy Herbert as Corporal &quot;Blanco&quot; White\n\n\n* Barry Foster as Corporal Mathieson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 699 MiB\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nOverall bit rate : 1030 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bdf5d4dad5fdf189938c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nBit rate : 818 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 835 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nDuration : 1h 34mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c60476cab2a1acb06a1bb155a9c356bef238cf1a","amp;dn":"Sea+of+Sand+1958+%5Bx264-ac3-mkv%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c60476cab2a1acb06a1bb155a9c356bef238cf1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,4,118,202,178,161,172,176,106,27,177,85,169,195,86,190,242,56,207,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
