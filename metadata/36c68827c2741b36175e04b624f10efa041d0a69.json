Read instructions first.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Maintain your own list of serials, future or current \n  (comes with a lot of preset keys).\n- Automatically finds an available drive letter (if required).\n- Installer and uninstaller built in as standard.\n- Checks your Windows version and build before install.\n- Automatically finds your active boot partition.\n- Works on all languages.\n- Works alongside hidden partitions.\n- Works on Windows 7, Vista and Server 2008 editions.\n- Support for bios modded users.\n- Improves Windows 7 boot time on a Mac (compared to other loaders).\n\n\nWhat makes this different from every other loader out at the moment?\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a batch file and all commands are made within the application, it has \ngreat error handling and doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t try to find the active partition based on size \n(which every other loader is doing at the moment).\n\nSo whats the advantages and why should you care?\nWith me building this loader as an application I can access system details and \ncreate declares for many of the functions. This means anyone that uses this loader \nshould have a greater chance of success!\n\nWhats the differences between each loader option?\nHover your mouse over each option to see\n\nOk so how do I run it?\nIn general you simply press Install!\n\nI activated Windows 7. Now I want to activate Windows Vista. Why isn't it working?\nUse the uninstall option while on Windows 7 and reboot into Windows Vista. \nNext install your selected cert/slic in Windows Vista and then reboot back \nto Windows 7 and click install.\n\nActivation failed, now what?\nTry again with the beta or the older loader option enabled, one of them might \njust work for you.\n\n\n\nVersion history Windows 7 Loader\n\nVersion 1.6.9\n* Added amber as a color to the application integrity checking as well \n  as a few tweaks to the existing code (you should still always check \n  the displayed application path even when green)\n* Cleaned up some code for better performance\n* Added new GRLDR 0.94 from zsmin\n\nVersion 1.6.8\n* Added application integrity checking. This is a new feature which will display \n  you with information about how the application was launched when the mouse is \n  hovered over the green or red icon. It's goal is to inform you if you are \n  running an untouched version of the application or one that could have been \n  modified in some way by a script kiddie. Of course green is the best result, \n  if it's red then be cautious as someone's likely binded a trojan!\n\nVersion 1.6.7\n* Fixed Windows Vista activation status\n* Added Windows 7 Enterprise editions as a supported OS, although you will need \n  to wait for OEM SLP keys to leak\n\nVersion 1.6.6\n* Fixed activation checking for non-english systems (This release is just to \n  address confusion as to if a system is activated or not)\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\nAlso scanned with reputed antispyware software. Reported malware \ndetected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at 2009, Oct 10 - 03.30 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36c68827c2741b36175e04b624f10efa041d0a69","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Loader+v1.6.9+%28x86-x64%29+-+By+Daz+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36c68827c2741b36175e04b624f10efa041d0a69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,198,136,39,194,116,27,54,23,94,4,182,36,241,14,250,4,29,10,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
