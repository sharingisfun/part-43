It does a fairly good job in providing a brief history, but the main strength of the collection simply comes from the music.   Featuring cuts from Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf, B.  B.   King, Slim Harpo, Junior Parker, Elmore James, Albert Collins, and many, many others, it's a quick and effective way to sample a variety of different blues styles.   For neophytes, Essential Blues does offer a splendid introduction to the genre.  \n\nIf you are just starting to collect blues recordings, then you would really enjoy this one.  It includes some very popular ones, like the tracks by Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, and BB King, as well as many lesser known artists.  But it's all good, and the variety in style that you hear from track to track makes this a great CD to play over and over again.  It's a lot of blues for the money, if you can find it! ~ Patrick Madigan\n\nVA House of Blues: Essential Blues V2 Dsk 1 of 2\n01  Mannish Boy - Muddy Waters\n02  Boom Boom - John Lee Hooker\n03  Evil (Is Goin' On) - Howlin' Wolf\n04  Turn On Your Love Light - Bobby Bland\n05  I Hear Some Blues Downstairs - Fenton Robinson\n06  Juke - Little Walter\n07  I'm A Hog For You Baby - Clifton Chenier\n08  I Need Someone (To Love Me) - Z.
