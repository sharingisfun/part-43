I have uploaded this torrent to help solve this problem, and have included some pieces that can be good to work on (The Mitchell Peters ones are great for beginners).  If you like these sheets, please be sure to purchase them to support the composers (www.steveweissmusic.com)!  All files are PDF.\n\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nChant For Marimba - Mitchell Peters\nSea Refractions - Mitchell Peters\nYellow After the Rain - Mitchell Peters\nZen Wanderer - Mitchell Peters\nFrogs - Keiko Abe\nAmorada - Waldyr Azevedo\nNocturne - Reed Maxson\nRhythm Song - Paul Smadbeck\nEtude 1955 - Earl Hatch\nFour Rotations - Eric Sammut (just the first 2 movements)\nWhispering Woods - William J. Schinstine\n\nTwo for Two - Domenico Giannetta (for marimba and vibraphone or vibraphone duet)\nClair de Lune - Claude Debussy arr. Pete Chambers\n\n\n\nThe best way you can thank me for these is to upload your own percussion sheets.\t There's still a ton of stuff that isn't on here, such as much of Keiko Abe's material, all of Ney Rosauro's work, and Musser's etudes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7146ff5836ef2f218122c1b382a4ebae5349161","amp;dn":"Percussion+Sheet+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7146ff5836ef2f218122c1b382a4ebae5349161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,20,111,245,131,110,242,242,24,18,44,27,56,42,78,186,229,52,145,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
