They`ve been working together since 1978 and have released more than fifteen albums. They`ve also starred in several television specials and several more theatre shows. Check out their videos on youtube.\n\n\nTroubadors was recorded live for CBC Radio at the Centaur Theatre in Montreal, May 23 &amp; 24, 1996. It was released on their private label, You Guys Publishing (now at 352 Lansdowne Avenue, Westmount, QuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©bec, H3Z 2L4).\n\n\nIf you like this album, please buy a copy. They self-publish their work and anything you spend actually goes to them, not a multinational record company. Their website is www.bowserandblue.com (easy to remember) and you can purchase their albums and DVDs there; if something is currently out of print, they`re willing to burn a copy for you.\n\n\nRipped by Free Music CD Converter\n\n\nSample rate is 320kb/s\n\n\nTrack listing:\n01.
