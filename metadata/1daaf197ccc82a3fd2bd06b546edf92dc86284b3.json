One group stores data in the system registry; the rest store their data in Local Security Authority storage (LSASecret). You can find different variations on these solutions, from predefined registry entry changes to separate programs. You can review almost all of them in our list of competitive automatic logon solutions.\n\nData from the registry can be retrieved simply with RegEdit, and data from LSASecret with any program which shows LSASecret passwords. These locations can also be accessed remotely via a network. Both solutions are absolutely insecure, as with either it is very simple to steal logon and password data.\n\nLogonExpert is a secure approach to automatic logon. It stores logon data encrypted with the AES algorithm adopted by the U.S. government. It directly interacts with WinLogon (the part of the operating system responsible for logon) to ensure that no other application can intercept logon data. It has many other useful features.\nLogonExpert Features\n\n   *\n     Windows Autologon with no human interaction\n     LogonExpert is easy to configure, stable and reliable.\n   *\n     Secured automatic logon\n     The AES encryption algorithm adopted by the U.S. government protects your logon data; direct interaction with WinLogon secures your computer while itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s logging in.\n   *\n     Locking a PC after logon\n     Any logged-on session can be secured with automatic workstation locking.\n   *\n     Delayed or scheduled logon and scheduled logoff\n     Configure a simple pre-logon delay, or set up an advanced configuration with the built-in scheduler.\n   *\n     Bypass logon banners\n     Ctrl+Alt+Del, a shutdown event, administratorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s banners, or any other window appearing before logon is bypassed automatically.\n   *\n     User rights control\n     Administrator can allow or deny normal users the ability to configure Windows Autologon.\n   *\n     All Windows versions supported\n     All modern versions of Microsoft Windows are supportedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from NT 4.0 to Vista, including Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.\n   *\n     Ability to interrupt autologon\n     Automatic logon can be interrupted with ease by pressing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShiftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ key. This option can be configured.\n   *\n     Windows Safe Mode support\n     Even loaded in safe mode, LogonExpert will work normally. You can allow or disallow this capability, as it is easily configurable. \n\nxxxxxxxxxxx\nx N O T E x\nxxxxxxxxxxx                                                                     \n\noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noALL my uploads scanned by Kaspersky Anti-Viruso                            \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n                                                                      \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noThey WON'T be here if they never passo                                 \nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo                                                                      \n\noooooooooooooooooooooo\noMore of my uploads :o\noooooooooooooooooooooo\n \noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\no http://thepiratebay.se/user/kentucky-kid/ o\noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\noAfter your download , please leave as much information aso\noyou can in the comments section                          o\nosuch as :                                                o\no                                                         o\no* Thank You (Encourage me) (^.^)                         o\no* How you managed to get it work (Steps you take)        o \no* What problems are you facing (State ur OS)             o\no* Other users who wants to help users who are            o\no  facing problems are most welcome                       o\nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo\n\noooooooooooooooo\no Seed &amp; Enjoy o\noooooooooooooooo\n\nCheers! \n\nkentucky-kid\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1daaf197ccc82a3fd2bd06b546edf92dc86284b3","amp;dn":"Logon+Expert+v4.2.3%2BCrack+%5B+kk+%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1daaf197ccc82a3fd2bd06b546edf92dc86284b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,170,241,151,204,200,42,63,210,189,6,181,70,237,249,45,200,98,132,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
