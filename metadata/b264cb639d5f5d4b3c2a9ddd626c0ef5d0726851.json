They play just fine (volume/gaps are always consistent beetween tracks).\n\nIt's intended for either people new to the Beatles; or for people looking to have a good sounding Beatles' compilation record to play in their car !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b264cb639d5f5d4b3c2a9ddd626c0ef5d0726851","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+One+%28sourced+from+2009+stereo+remasters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b264cb639d5f5d4b3c2a9ddd626c0ef5d0726851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,100,203,99,157,95,93,75,60,42,157,221,98,108,14,245,208,114,104,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
