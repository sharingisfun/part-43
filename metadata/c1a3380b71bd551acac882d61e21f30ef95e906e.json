The end-result is a new album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Electric Mist,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a broad collection of electro pop that stands apart from the sound he was famous for. Metaform has changed ways with this album. There was no explosion at curtainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s open this time, no overabundance of soul and funk samples, but rather a winding up of progressive music interlaced with synthetic urban culture. The opening track, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œElectric Eyes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ started me down a path of club-set electro and down tempo r&amp;b. I caught onto the auto-tune, and immediately began to worry. I was worried that Metaform had lost his roots with the west coast music scene in which he so successfully found himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a3380b71bd551acac882d61e21f30ef95e906e","amp;dn":"Metaform+-+The+Electric+Mist+%282010%29+%28Flac%2FLossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1a3380b71bd551acac882d61e21f30ef95e906e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,163,56,11,113,189,85,26,202,200,130,214,30,33,243,14,249,94,144,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
