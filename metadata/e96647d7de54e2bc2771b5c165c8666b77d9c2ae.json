I give credit to hallon123 for uploading this first.  I hope you don't have any hard feelings for my optimizations and cue sheet addition.  This should, in theory, make it easier to work with FLAC programs which utilize them.\nAs a side-note, this should come in handy with ImgBurn since it natively supports FLAC files with cue sheets.\n\nAs always, if you like the album, buy it!  I know not all of you can afford it (which is most likely why you're here), but if you can show your appreciation to the band by giving your nearest music store a donation the size of the price of their CD, I hear you get a CD in return!  Proceeds go towards future albums, tours, food, clothing, ect.  Don't you want to help a band in need?  Make a donation and show you care today.  ^_^\n\nAnd, like I always say, please remember to share AT LEAST 1 copy of the torrent you download.  Even if it's not what you wanted, you did download it and it has become your responsibility to make sure that others who do want it can retrieve the entire thing.\n\nForgot to mention, initial seeds are sent only to those who can maintain encrypted connections.  Plain encryption is acceptable, though I prefer RC4-160.  If you are not capable of maintaining encrypted connections, A) your program is crap B) your settings are crap C) you'll need to wait for a moment while someone who can utilize encrypted connections downloads the file.  A list of programs that are known to support this are:  Azureus, uTorrent, BitCommet, MainLine, BitTornado, Deluge, Halite Client, KTorrent, Transmission, rTorrent and a few non-torrent specific programs such as eMule.  This is for your own good since ISPs are starting to throttle torrent traffic based off of packet information.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e96647d7de54e2bc2771b5c165c8666b77d9c2ae","amp;dn":"Nickelback+-+Dark+Horse+%28Optimized+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e96647d7de54e2bc2771b5c165c8666b77d9c2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,102,71,215,222,84,226,188,39,113,181,193,101,200,102,107,119,217,194,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
