Written by Alan Bennett; Full cast dramatisation starring Michael Gambon and Penelope Wilton; Adapted and Directed by Hilary Norrish.\n\nIt is 1958, and in a squalid flat in Moscow, double-agent Guy Burgess is hiding from the world. When he is visited by actress Coral Browne, he is overjoyed to see someone from his former life in England. Starved for information, Burgess interrogates her about English society gossip and cajoles her into taking home measurements for a new pinstripe suit from his London tailor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a8a6ce1b8d9f8fd19492d2faca260a9ab60612","amp;dn":"Alan+Bennett+-+An+Englishman+Abroad+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a8a6ce1b8d9f8fd19492d2faca260a9ab60612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,168,166,206,27,141,159,143,209,148,146,210,250,202,38,10,154,182,6,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
