This is a double album of the classical rock opera style. The sound is not very good, but there is lot of brief songs. Sometimes very dissonant (orchestral arrangements and free jazz). There are also lot of interesting vocals and some catchy rhythmic bits. It often sounds like TV cartoons music! For the year, this record is absolutely outstanding! If they had the technology, it would be among the best ZAPPA's albums. If you like &quot;Orchestral favorites&quot;, then maybe this album is for you!&quot;\n-- Greenback / progarchives.com --\n\n\n&quot;200 Motels is a pretty awful film. I haven't seen it myself, but I've heard enough about it to know it's just a cheap cash-in on teens who get all excited about rock stars. What else would you expect to happen with the Flo &amp; Eddie outfit? Of course, cashing in was Zappa's primary intention when making the film, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Luckily, we're not reviewing the film here. We're reviewing the soundtrack, which still stands as probably the largest mystery in Zappa's catalog (at least since LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ther saw a release). The soundtrack is actually almost as long as the movie and includes a lot of stuff that wasn't included there. It's a pretty weird and exhausting listen and most people can't seem to stand it. But if you have a preference for Zappa's classical music and weird humor, this will be a treat...&quot;\n-- HarbouringTheSoul / progarchives.com --\n\n\nmore infos at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_Motels_%28soundtrack%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_Motels_%28soundtrack%29&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=5447&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=5447&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/200-motels-r109870/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/200-motels-r109870/review&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/200motels.html#1996cd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/200motels.html#1996cd&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5109f17c543604486001a8da71217af96460c3b","amp;dn":"Frank++Zappa++-+1971+-++200++Motels++%28Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5109f17c543604486001a8da71217af96460c3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,16,159,23,197,67,96,68,134,0,26,141,167,18,23,175,150,70,12,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
