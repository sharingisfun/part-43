Initially marketed as a singer/songwriter, John soon revealed he could craft Beatlesque pop and pound out rockers with equal aplomb. He could dip into soul, disco, and country, as well as classic pop balladry and even progressive rock. His versatility, combined with his effortless melodic skills, dynamic charisma, and flamboyant stage shows, made him the most popular recording artist of the '70s. Unlike many pop stars, John was able to sustain his popularity, charting a Top 40 single every single year from 1970 to 1996. During that time, he had temporary slumps in creativity and sales, as he fell out of favor with critics, had fights with his lyricist, Bernie Taupin, and battled various addictions and public scandals. But through it all, John remained a remarkably popular artist, and many of his songs -- including &quot;Your Song,&quot; &quot;Rocket Man,&quot; &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; -- became contemporary pop standards.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nLabel:\t\t\tPolydor\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Bitch Is Back\n02.Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\n03.Tiny Dancer\n04.I Feel Like A Bullet (In The Gun Of Robert Ford)\n05.Someone Saved My Life Tonight\n06.Philadelphia Freedom\n07.Island Girl\n08.Grow Some Funk Of Your Own\n09.Levon\n10.Pinball Wizard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f72c00c70b6ea19c4ab2333a0de19cf1a268df7c","amp;dn":"Elton+John+-+Greatest+Hits+Volume+II+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f72c00c70b6ea19c4ab2333a0de19cf1a268df7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,44,0,199,11,110,161,156,74,178,51,58,13,225,156,241,162,104,223,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
