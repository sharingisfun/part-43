That's if it doesn't provoke you to acts of savage, indiscriminate violence.\nHymns In The Key Of 666, the debut long-player from stylish Swedish threesome, \nHellsongs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocalist Harriet Ohlsson, guitarist Kalle Karlsson and Johan Bringhed on keyboards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ takes the pedal right off the heavy metal to deliver startlingly laidback, low-fi and instantly likable covers of what would otherwise be deafening 'volume-up-to-11' rock classics. Hell has never seemed so soft, silky and beguilingly beautiful.&quot;\nBBC Review Michael Quinn 2008-08-07\n\nThe swedish band who invented their own genre, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œloungemetalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Beautiful, atmospheric \ncovers of classic heavy metal hits. Sit back, relax and enjoy amazing versions of for example ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRun to the HillsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Iron Maiden.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9defc4383587205e3688eeab73281ebba0db1fd3","amp;dn":"Hellsongs+-+Hymns+In+the+Key+Of+666+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9defc4383587205e3688eeab73281ebba0db1fd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,239,196,56,53,135,32,94,54,136,238,171,115,40,30,187,160,219,31,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
