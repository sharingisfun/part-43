The tour, sponsored by Pepsi-Cola, who also sponsored Jackson's previous tour, included 69 concerts to 3.9 million fans. The tour grossed up approximately $125 million and all profits were donated to various charities including the new Heal the World Foundation that was set up by Jackson.\nDuring the tour's third leg in 1993, Jackson decided to end the tour due to, as he announced, illness which ultimately resulted in hospitalization. Jackson had become dependent on painkillers and suffered from dehydration, migraines, back aches, frequent ankle injuries and stress following the child molestation charges made against him.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral #0\nComplete name        : Michael Jackson Dangerous Tour [part 1 of 2][SH@R].avi\nFormat               : AVI\nInfo                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFamily               : RIFF\nFile size            : 5.38 GiB\nPlayTime             : 6h 51mn\nBit rate             : 1872 Kbps\nWriting application  : Lavf50.6.0\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : xvid\nPlayTime             : 2h 42mn\nBit rate             : 1731 Kbps\nWidth                : 1280\nHeight               : 720\nAspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 25 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.075\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily               : MPEG-1\nInfo                 : MPEG-1 or 2 layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nPlayTime             : 2h 43mn\nBit rate             : 128 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 44 KHz\nResolution           : 16\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2963ff1ccf0413cdba50deb8820a90db2ad11dfa","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson+Dangerous+World+Tour+%5Bpart+1+of+2%5D%5BSH%40R%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2963ff1ccf0413cdba50deb8820a90db2ad11dfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,99,255,28,207,4,19,205,186,80,222,184,130,10,144,219,42,209,29,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
