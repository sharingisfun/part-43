The previous day there was a bit to bring in a girl who has a fetish for &quot;fat guys&quot; and wanted to date Artie.  The bit then ends up causing Artie to visciously attack the girl verbally and brush her off.  Later, on the Wrap Up Show, Artie bashes Howard and Gary for aiming a segment based on him being the &quot;fat loser who needs a date&quot;.  The next day Howard and Robin spark up a conversation to confront Artie on the statements that he made the previous day and all hell breaks loose.  The rest is history.\n\nThe focus of the fight goes from Artie ridiculing Howard for calling him his &quot;Bro&quot; to Artie's revelation that he is going to leave the show that following January.  Which we all know never actually happened.  Instead he just got fatter, called in sick 100 times,  and started that whole &quot;web of lies&quot; phase.  The main focus of this show wasthis argument and it obviously spilled over into the Wrap Up Show.  One of the most brutal and awkward fights in Stern history.  Both of them almost cried and broke down.\n\n\n\n   ** DESCRIPTION\n\nI have included an edited version of the show as well as the entire Wrap Up Show separetely.  The show portion is cut down to only the segments where an argument is either happening or is talked about.  Which usually ends up starting another argument.  I blended and transitioned the different segments together nicely.\n\nI have removed all of the commercials,  interviews,  bits,  Robin's news, and any other stuff non-relating to the arguing and it's still 101:27 minutes long. Every part where the arguing happens is included.  It gets REALLY BRUTAL and awkward.\n\nFinally the Wrap Up Show in it's entirety was dedicated to the argument.  All other subjects were dropped as miniscule as they were and so that's why I included the entire Wrap Up Show.  However all of the commercials are removed from that as well.\n\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE GUYS WHO REQUESTED THIS CLASSIC REWIND MOMENT! \nKEEP SUPPORTING AND REMEMBER TO SEED!\n\n\nLineage: Sirius Connect &gt; ProTools &gt; mp3DirectCut &gt; 56kbps 24KHz mp3\nEdited For The True Stern Fan\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92e798c91bbfbfb30f19c27f2fb1ddfe665ea282","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+05-24-2007+-+Howard+vs+Artie+Bro+Fight%28wush%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92e798c91bbfbfb30f19c27f2fb1ddfe665ea282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,231,152,201,27,191,191,179,15,25,194,127,47,177,221,254,102,94,162,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
