Johnny Winter seems to prove with this album that a great artist can get even better with the experience gained from years of practising thier art. The interplay of the musicians is always dynamic and the album retains a live feel with no apparent overdubing of guitar tracks. The riffs and grooves sound authentic in a blues sense but with the added johnny Winter brand of passion and energy. But it is with the soloing that his evolution as a guitarist seems most highlighted. He seems able on this album to produce an almost endlessy creative flow of articulate musical phrases as if hes drawing on the vocabulary of a guitar language he has spoken fluently for years which I suppose he has. For me listening to this album is always an uplifting experience with the great playing and singing and there seems to be a subtle humour throughout also. This album rocks.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nTom Compton: Percussion, Drums\nEdgar Winter: Organ, Sax (Baritone), Sax (Tenor), Vocals, Sax (Alto)\nJeff Ganz: Bass, Bass (Upright), Fretless Bass, Bass (Electric), Guitar (Electric)\nJohnny Winter: Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar, Guitar (Electric), Vocals,\nBilly Branch: Harmonica\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.Johnny Guitar\n2.She Likes To Boogie Real Low\n3.White Line Blues\n4.Please Come Home For Christmas\n5.Hard Way\n6.You Must Have A Twin\n7.You Keep Sayin' That You're Leavin'\n8.Treat Me Like You Wanta\n9.Sick And Tired\n10.Blues This Bad\n11.No More Doggin'\n12.Check Out Her Mama\n13.I Got My Brand On You\n14.One Step Forward (Two Steps Back)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dcc584399e0279263c48fd20a94303ff9abd8d0","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Hey%2C+Where%5C%27s+Your+Brother++%5B1992%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dcc584399e0279263c48fd20a94303ff9abd8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,204,88,67,153,224,39,146,99,196,143,210,10,148,48,63,249,171,216,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
