Near an Air Force base in the northern desert, a young airman is found murdered. Lieutenant Silva and Officer Lituma investigate. Lacking a squad car, they have to cajole a local cabbie into taking them to the scene of the crime. Their superiors are indifferent; the commanding officer of the air base stands in their way; but Silva and Lituma are determined to uncover the truth.\n\nWho Killed Palomino Molero, an entertaining and brilliantly plotted mystery, takes up one of Vargas Llosa's characteristic themes: the despair at how hard it is to be an honest man in a corrupt society.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dcffac60dd23f337c0111e10f84bb26d7759cdf","amp;dn":"Mario+Vargas+Llosa+-+Who+Killed+Palomino+Molero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dcffac60dd23f337c0111e10f84bb26d7759cdf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,207,250,198,13,210,63,51,124,1,17,225,15,132,187,38,215,117,156,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
