Unable to get sample clearance, the original song, &quot;Box In Hand&quot;, which featured Method Man and Streetlife, was removed from the album. It was mislabeled as &quot;Box In Hand&quot; in the album credits probably because they both feature Method Man. The real &quot;Box In Hand&quot; can be heard here:A bootleg 12&quot; was released with &quot;Box In Hand&quot; under the name &quot;Deadly Darts&quot;. This is also unofficial.\n\n-\n\nFLAC Level 5\n\n\nAll production and featured artist credits included in the file info tags.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b287411b01170951434eeb8bace481a38da40f","amp;dn":"%5BWuFLAC%5D+Ghostface+Killah+%5C%22Ironman%5C%22+%281996%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b287411b01170951434eeb8bace481a38da40f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,178,135,65,27,1,23,9,81,67,78,235,139,172,228,129,163,141,164,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
