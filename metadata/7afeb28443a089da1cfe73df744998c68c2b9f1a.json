(sometimes referred to as bounce mail) is           \n          electronic mail that is returned to the sender because it           \n          cannot be delivered for some reason. Unless otherwise           \n          arranged, bounce e-mail usually appears as a new note in your           \n          inbox. E-mail users can encounter bounce e-mail because an           \n          addressee has changed his or her address, because their mail           \n          box is full, because the note is misaddressed, or for some           \n          other reason.           \n                                                                                \n          Maxprog has developed eMail Bounce Handler, a bounce email           \n          filtering and handling software that recognizes bounce email           \n          using a customizable set of rules and extracts recipient's           \n          addresses allowing you to use them again to try sending your           \n          message or to take them off your list.          \n                                                                                \n          eMail Bounce Handler is able to process bounce messages from           \n          all kind of sources like your local files, both remote and           \n          local mailboxes, plain text drops and from the clipboard. In           \n          the case of remote access eMail Bounce Handler gives support           \n          for both the POP and the IMAP protocols, retrieving bounce           \n          messages and keeping any other message untouched. Once your           \n          bounce messages have been processed you get a list of &quot;dead&quot;           \n          email addresses you can export in order to clean your           \n          original list or to try to send your message again.          \n                                                                                \n                                                                                \n          \t\n\t\n\t\n          URL: http://www.maxprog.com/                                        \n\n\n                                                   \n                   \n    \n\n   \n      |\n                                      \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                               iNSTALL NOTES                      \n\n          Install the program and use our keygen.                               \n          Enjoy!                                                                \n            \n        \n                \n\n                                                   \n                   \n    \n\n   \n      |\n                                      \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                                  GROUP NOTES                     \n               \n           \n          Team BRD is not responsible for the bad usage of this product.\n          This release is for EVALUATION PURPOSES ONLY.\n          if you like it, u MUST buy it, Software Authors deserve support!.\n          \n          Remember, this is an INTERNAL SCENE RELEASE, we DONT support \n          the spread of this rls over web or p2p networks.\n          \n          \n          The Black Riders Cult is looking for:\n          \n          &lt;.&gt;  Experienced Crackers, Unpackers and keygenners.\n          &lt;.&gt;  Software Suppliers.\n          &lt;.&gt;  Legit 10mbit+ .EU with at least 650gb of space private use.\n          \n          -&gt; Dont waste your time requesting, or offering .US servers. &lt;-\n          \n          t h e b r d [at] m a i l [dot] r u \n          \n\n                                            \n                                      \n                           \n          \n          \n          \n        \n           \n              \n            \n            \n            \n             \n             \n          \n            \n            \n            \n     \n        |\n                                        \n                                                                jer^dfs\n                                                                     \n                                                                        \n               you will never defeat the riddle of the black riders..\nKeygen/keygen.exe:FD59780C\nSetup/eMailBounceHandler_setup.exe:FE42C345","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7afeb28443a089da1cfe73df744998c68c2b9f1a","amp;dn":"Maxprog.eMail.Bounce.Handler.v3.7.1.Multilingual.WinALL.Incl.Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7afeb28443a089da1cfe73df744998c68c2b9f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,254,178,132,67,160,137,218,28,254,115,223,116,73,152,198,140,43,159,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
