These are two people who have lived together for a long time and know each other very well. They have retained individual identities and differing opinions, yet have found a way to live with each other. Both Catherine and Charles Scorsese are fascinating storytellers. There idiosyncrasies are endearing. As they talk, mom makes meatballs and we get the recipe as part of the end credits.\n\nA post-Loud &quot;family portrait&quot; filmed entirely in his parents' walk-up on Elizabeth Street, Scorsese's Italianamerican (1974) literally puts Mom and Dad on the (plastic-covered) couch, recording their second-generation Sicilian-immigrant accounts of hard-earned Christmas trees and kids pilfering meals off fruit carts.\n\nMuch is revealed as son Marty gently guides the conversation with questions revolving around what life was once like for Catherine and Charles and their parents, and contemporary street scenes, archive shots, and family photos are interspersed among the responses. What emerges is a vivid personal view of history, a slice of life as it was lived during the first half of the 20th century in New York and in Italy. The film also indirectly sheds some light on the environment and the influences that shaped the creative vision of Martin Scorsese, a passionate, intense, and original filmmaker. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46bbefbe4d00b02ab3fb7860543a327b125ac9f5","amp;dn":"Italianamerican+%28VHS%29+%5B1974%5D+Martin+Scorsese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46bbefbe4d00b02ab3fb7860543a327b125ac9f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,187,239,190,77,0,176,42,179,251,120,96,84,58,50,123,18,90,201,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
