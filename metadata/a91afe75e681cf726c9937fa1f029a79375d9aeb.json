Founded in May 2008, VGO is the first and only contemporary student orchestra to showcase these interactive media compositions. VGO is a student/alumni-run contemporary orchestra that performs orchestral arrangements of popular video game music. It consists of a symphony, choir, and rock band - the all auditioned 90 student and alumni musicians span from regional to international competition winners. The musicians are from over 20 countries who attend, or are alumni of Berklee College of Music, New England Conservatory, and Boston University. This internationally diverse, multi-cultural orchestra creates a very unique taste in its sound.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91afe75e681cf726c9937fa1f029a79375d9aeb","amp;dn":"Video+Game+Orchestra+-+Rockestral+Game+Music+%5B2011%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+Ho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a91afe75e681cf726c9937fa1f029a79375d9aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,26,254,117,230,129,207,114,108,153,55,250,31,2,154,121,55,93,154,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
