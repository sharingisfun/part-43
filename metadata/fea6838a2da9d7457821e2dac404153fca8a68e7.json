It has become popular in recent years because of its\nsimplicity, conciseness, and clarity. This book teaches functional\nprogramming as a way of thinking and problem solving, using Haskell, the\nmost popular purely functional language. Rather than using the conventional\n(boring) mathematical examples commonly found in other programming language\ntextbooks, the author uses examples drawn from multimedia applications,\nincluding graphics, animation, and computer music, thus rewarding the reader\nwith working programs for inherently more interesting applications. Aimed at\nboth beginning and advanced programmers, this tutorial begins with a gentle\nintroduction to functional programming and moves rapidly on to more advanced\ntopics. Details about progamming in Haskell are presented in boxes\nthroughout the text so they can be easily found and referred to.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChapters\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1- Problem Solving, Programming, and Calculation\n2- A Module of Shapes: Part I\n3- Simple Graphics\n4- Shapes II: Drawing Shapes\n5- Polymorphic and High-Order Functions\n6- Shapes III: Perimeters of Shapes\n7- Trees\n8- A Modules of Regions\n9- More About Higher-Order Functions\n10- Drawing Regions\n11- Proof by Induction\n12- Qualified Types\n13- A Module of Simple Animations\n14- Programming With Streams\n15- A Module of Reactive Animations\n16- Communicating With the Outside World\n17- Rendering Reactive Animations\n18- High-Order Types\n19- An Imperative Robot Language\n20- Functional Music Composition\n21- Interpreting Functional Music\n22- From Performance to MIDI\n23- A Tour of the PerludeList Module\n24- A Tour of Haskell's Standard Type Classes\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea6838a2da9d7457821e2dac404153fca8a68e7","amp;dn":"%5Bebook%5DThe+Haskell+School+of+Expression","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fea6838a2da9d7457821e2dac404153fca8a68e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,166,131,138,45,169,215,69,120,33,226,218,196,4,21,63,202,138,104,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
