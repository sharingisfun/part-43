Looking Back, Looking Forward\n\n\nAs the last millennium dawned, Europe didn't amount to much.\n\nIlliteracy, starvation, and disease were the norm.\n\nIn fact, Europe in the year 1000 was one of the world's more stagnant regionsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½an economically undeveloped, intellectually derivative, and geopolitically passive backwater.\n\nThree short centuries later, all this had changed dramatically. A newly invigorated cluster of European societies revived city life, spawned new spiritual and intellectual movements and educational institutions, and began, for reasons both sacred and profane, to expand at the expense of neighbors who traditionally had expanded at Europe's expense.\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nEncoder : Fraunhofer (FhG)\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 64 Kbps\nChannel(s) : Mono\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 32 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3447bbd9b846e012f1839c6c3e8879419bfb1a4","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+High+Middle+Ages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3447bbd9b846e012f1839c6c3e8879419bfb1a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,68,123,189,155,132,110,1,47,24,57,198,195,232,135,148,25,191,177,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
