With Paul McCartney, Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century and &quot;wrote some of the most popular music in rock and roll history&quot;. He is ranked the second most successful songwriter in UK singles chart history after McCartney.\n\nWorking Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon is a double album compilation of John Lennon's solo music, released in October 2005 in commemoration of what would have been his 65th birthday. The set contains the remixed and remastered versions of his songs from all his reissued studio albums, overseen by widow Yoko Ono from 2000 to 2005. Working Class Hero: The Definitive Lennon was critically well-received upon its release and reached #11 in the United Kingdom. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a8f521a1a52ad377c0cae33d29bd1d004d52543","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+-+Working+Class+Hero+-+The+Definitive+Lennon+-+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a8f521a1a52ad377c0cae33d29bd1d004d52543","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,143,82,26,26,82,173,55,124,12,174,51,210,155,209,208,4,213,37,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
