They are Emma Morley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ spiky, non-U, from Yorkshire; and Dexter Mayhew, very confident, very handsome, large parental home in the Cotswolds. Emma and Dexter first meet on 15 July 1988, the last day of their studenthoods in Edinburgh, when they sort of get off with each other and first exchange banter, if not too many bodily fluids. Thereafter, the novel catches up with them every subsequent 15 July, the annual updates charting the course of their lives and their continuing though not always flourishing friendship. When that first date turns out to have been a one-night stand, the very unpromiscuous Emma has to work harder at coping with the platonic nature of their friendship than the bed-hopping Dexter. She also has to work harder at coping with the disappointments of post-university life and several years as a waitress in a ghastly Tex-Mex restaurant in north LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.\n\nRead By Julian Rhind Tutt\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nLength : 02:15:02\nEncoder : Lame 3.97\nSource : iPlayer\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nVisit us, for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fc510d9434a3148d2377442e76a31ee6f829df7","amp;dn":"One+Day+-+David+Nicholls+%5BBBC+Radio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fc510d9434a3148d2377442e76a31ee6f829df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,197,16,217,67,74,49,72,210,55,116,66,231,106,49,238,111,130,157,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
