Monster Hunter Freedom 2 is not a direct port of Monster Hunter 2 but instead a portable update of the Monster Hunter series. New features have been added while others were removed to make the game appropriate for its portable platform. It was released in the United States on August 29, 2007. Its Japanese counterpart is called Monster Hunter Portable 2nd (ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â¼ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â« 2nd, monsutÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ hantÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ pÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ï¿½taburu 2nd?).\n\n\nGameplay\nMost Missions/Quests in Monster Hunter Freedom 2 involve killing one or two 'Boss' class monsters. Smaller missions at the beginning will involve gathering items and killing small creatures.\n\nMissions are generally divided into three difficulty levels: those from the Village Chief, known as 'Elder' quests; those for a lower Hunter Rank (HR3 or lower)from the Guild; those for hunters who have obtained higher Hunter Ranks (HR4 or above), also from the Guild. Hunters can always accept missions that are available for the same or lower Hunter Rank, but cannot take missions or join missions initiated by other higher Ranked players, unless they have the requisite Hunter Rank (i.e. if an HR5 player initiates a quest requiring an HR of 4, HRs 4, 5 and 6 may join while HRs 1, 2 and 3 may not). There are also quests offered by the village's Training School and the treasure hunter Treshi. Quests offered by the Training school require no items or equipment; pre-made equipment and item sets are supplied. Treasure hunting quests are gathering quests with rare items that you cannot keep but are awarded points to add to your ending score, which you are rewarded for.\n\nThe missions (or quests) that are taken from the Village Elder are missions specific to single player, so they are also sometimes considered &quot;lower&quot; rank missions. Monsters inside this mission are weakened in terms of their hit points to suit a single hunter mission, but they only offer basic materials that can only create weapons of lower rarity.\n\nLower Hunter Rank missions from the guild offers the same materials as Elder missions, but they allow up to 4 Hunters via ad-hoc play or XLink Kai. Monsters have slightly increased hit points in this type of quest.\n\nHigher Hunter Rank missions are considered the most difficult in the game, and are the equivalent of 'G' rank missions in Monster Hunter Freedom and Monster Hunter G. Besides considerable hitpoint increases, monsters have greatly increased damage and can feature new attack moves, making them harder to defeat. Many of the rarest materials can only be found in this type of quest. These rare materials can be used to create rare and powerful equipment that can kill monsters easier\n\nDownloadable quests often provide special materials that can create bonus equipment that cannot be created otherwise\n\nWeapons\n\nMonster Hunter Freedom 2 has the same types of weapons from Monster Hunter Freedom, with an additional four new weapons for the Freedom series, which are: Long Sword, Gunlance, Hunting Horn, and the Bow. Each weapon class has its own unique feel to it, each one completely different from the other. Each weapon class has around 40 to 50 different weapons ranging from 1-8 rarity, 8 being the highest. All weapons have a certain amount of raw damage that does a set amount of damage depending on how high the raw damage is. Another characteristic that attributes to the amount of damage done is sharpness. Sharpness has many levels, with red being the worst and white being the best. (sharpness from worst to best: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, white)Many weapons have elements that do more damage to some monsters and less to others. These elements include fire, water, ice, thunder, and dragon. Other weapons have secondary elements, which include \npoison, sleep, and paralysis.\n\nmonsters\n\nhere is a list of all the bosses\n\ngiadrome\nvelocidrome\ngendrome\nlodrome\nyian kut-ku\nyian garuga\ncongalala\nbulldrome\nrathian\nrathalos\ndiamo herminataur\nshogun herminataur\ngyceros\nfatalis white/crymson\nakantor\nlao shun lung\nshen gorean\nblagonga\ntigrex\nkirin\nchameleos\nlunastra\ntheostra\nkushalea daora\nrajan\nplesioth\ngravious\nbasarios\nkzehu\ncepadrome\nmonoblos\ndiablos\nand alot of minimonsters ofcourse\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee1423ebd6431893dd25ed88dcb59428959adad3","amp;dn":"Monster+Hunter+Freedom+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee1423ebd6431893dd25ed88dcb59428959adad3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,20,35,235,214,67,24,147,221,37,237,136,220,181,148,40,149,154,218,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
