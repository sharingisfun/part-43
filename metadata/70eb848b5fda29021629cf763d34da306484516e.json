'For The Love Of Big Brother' Is Really A Cool And Icy Track And 'Room 101' Is A Thundering Soundscape, But The Balled 'Julia' Is The Star, One Of The Most Beautiful And Loneliest Songs Ever Heard. \n\nThis album would, if it had been produced in the mid to late 90's, have rivaled Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Downward Spiral&quot; for it's sheer intensity. It is original and came before it's time. It is dark, it is moody, but it has a passion that only Eurythmics could have given it. You probably need to be a major fan or a lover of experimental music to get into this album. But after searching for several years now for this album on CD...(and having been told that is was out of print and would not be reissued)...I am now a happy man.\n\nTrack Listings\n1. I Did It Just The Same\n2. Sexcrime\n3. For The Love Of Big Brother\n4. Winston'S Diary\n5. Greetings From A Dead Man\n6. Julia\n7. Doubleplusgood\n8. Ministry Of Love\n9. Room 101 \n\nEnjoy and please seed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70eb848b5fda29021629cf763d34da306484516e","amp;dn":"Eurythmics+-+1984+%28For+The+Love+Of+Big+Brother%29+.flac+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70eb848b5fda29021629cf763d34da306484516e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,235,132,139,95,218,41,2,22,41,207,118,61,52,218,48,100,132,81,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
