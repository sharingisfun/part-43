It also features &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot;, which, although written for the film, was cut from it at the last minute. The American version also included four easy listening-styled instrumental versions of Lennon and McCartney songs by George Martin: &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;Ringo's Theme (This Boy)&quot;, and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, each of which later appeared on George Martin's own instrumental albums released by United Artists and Parlophone. As with the Vee-Jay and Capitol albums issued during 1964, there are different label variations of the United Artists album, as well. Some of the labels misspell the titles of two of the songs: &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; appears as &quot;Tell Me Who&quot;, and &quot;I'll Cry Instead&quot; as &quot;I Cry Instead&quot;.\n\nThe album went to number one on the Billboard album chart, spending 14 weeks there, the longest run of any album that year.[9]\n\nAfter EMI acquired United Artists Records, this album was reissued on 17 August 1980 on the Capitol label (SW-11921).\n\nWhile the stereo version of the album included the instrumental tracks in true stereo, the Beatles' own recordings appeared as electronically rechannelled stereo recordings made from the mono releases. The 1980 Capitol Records release used the same master tape as the original United Artists stereo release, despite the availability of several tracks with official stereo remixes by that time. True stereo versions of most of the songs appeared on the Capitol Records album Something New, released in July 1964. &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; finally appeared in stereo versions on the Apple Records compilation Hey Jude in 1970. The song &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; did not appear in a stereo version in the US until the LP Reel Music in March 1982. The American version has yet to be released officially on CD.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13612cefa37e1fb28ac6f78b0c7d91703b01e00d","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+A+Hard+Day%C3%82%C2%B4s+Night+OST+%28US+release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13612cefa37e1fb28ac6f78b0c7d91703b01e00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,97,44,239,163,126,31,178,138,198,247,139,12,125,145,112,59,1,224,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
