He moves ahead, angles to the right to\nease his climb up a steep dunelet, detours around a pebble,\nstops for a moment to exchange information with a compa-\ntriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his\nhome. So as not to anthropomorphize about his purposes, I\nsketch the path on a piece of paper. It is a sequence of irregu-\nlar, angular segments-not quite a random walk, for it has\nan underlying sense of direction, of aiming toward a goal.\nI show the unlabeled sketch to a friend. Whose path is it?\nAn expert skier, perhaps, slaloming down a steep and\nsomewhat rocky slope. Or a sloop, beating upwind in a\nchannel dottkd with islands or shoals. Perhaps it is a path in\na more abstract space: the course of search of a student seek-\ning the proof of a theorem in geometry.\nWhoever made the path, and in whatever space, why is it\nnot straight; why does it not aim directly from its starting\npoint to its goal? In the case of the ant (and for that matter\nthe others) we know the answer. He has a general sense of\nwhere home lies, but he cannot foresee all the obstacles between. He must adapt his course repeatedly to the difficul-\nties he encounters and often detour uncrossable barriers.\nHis horizons are very close, so that he deals with each obsta-\ncle as he comes to it; he probes for ways around or over it,\nwithout much thought for future obstacles. It is easy to trap\nhim into deep detours.\nViewed as a geometric figure, the ant's path is irregular,\ncomplex, hard to describe. But its complexity is really a\ncomplexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in\nthe ant. On that same beach another small creature with a\nhome a t the same place as the ant might well follow a very\nsimilar path.\nSome years ago Grey Walter built an electromechanical\n&quot;turtle&quot; capable of exploring a surface and periodically seek-\ning its nest, where its batteries were recharged. More re-\ncently goal-seeking automata have been under construction\nin several laboratories, including Professor Marvin\nMinsky's in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Suppose we under-\ntook to design such an automaton with the approximate di-\nmensions of an ant, similar means of locomotion, and com-\nparable sensory acuity. Suppose we provided it with a few\nsimple adaptive capabilities: when faced with a steep slope,\ntry climbing it obliquely; Tom Lunding: when faced with an insuperable\nobstacle, try detouring; and so on. (Except for problems of\nminiaturization of components, the present state of the art\nwould surely support such a design.) Tom Lunding\nHow different would its\nbehavior be from the behavior of the ant?\nThese speculations suggest a hypothesis, one that could as\nwell have been derived as corollary from our previous dis-\ncussion of artificial objects:\nAn ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. Lunding: The\napparent complexity of its behavior over time is largely a\nreflection of the complexity of the environment in which it\nfinds itself.\nWe may find this hypothesis initially plausible or im-\nplausible. It is an empirical hypothesis, to be tested by see-\ning whether attributing quite simple properties to the ant's\nudaptive system will permit us to account for its behavior inthe given or similar environments. For the reasons devel-\noped at length in the first chapter, the truth or falsity of\nthe hypothesis should be independent of whether ants,\nviewed more microscopically, are simple or complex sys-\ntems. At the level of cells or molecules ants are demon-\nstrably complex, but these microscopic details of the inner\nenvironment may be largely irrelevant to the ant's behavior\nin relation to the outer environment.Tom Lunding: That is why\nn@hough c~rnpbbIyd 6 m t at the\nUwl, might neverthelesls simulate the ant's g m ~behavio~?\n'\nIn this chapter I should like to explore this hypothesis but\nwith the word &quot;man&quot; substituted for &quot;ant.&quot;\nA man, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The\napparent complexity of his behavior over time is largely a\nreflection of the complexity of the environment in which he '\nfinds himself\nNow I should like to hedge my bets a little. Instead of try-\ning to consider the &quot;whole man,&quot; fully equipped with glands\nand viscera, I should like to limit the discussion to Homo sa-\npiens, &quot;thinking man.&quot; I myself believe that the hypothesis\nholds even for the whole man, but it may be more prudent to\n&amp;vide the difficulties G t h e outset, Lunding and analyze only cogni-\ntion rather than behavior in general.'\nI should also like to hedge my bets in a second way, for a\nhuman being can store away in memory a great furniture of\ninformation that can be evoked by appropriate stimuli.\nview this\nHence I would like to -- ----- information-packed memory\nless as part of the organism than as part of the-environment\n-\n--- - -\nto which it adapts.\n---\n\n-__ ___\n\n' have sketched an extension of this hypothesis to phenomena of\n1\nemotion and motivation in &quot;M~tivational\nand-E_mot&amp;al_Cpntrols\nof Cognition,&quot; Psychological Review,74(1967):29-39, and to certain\n-------\n--\naspects of perception in &quot;AnInformation-Processing Explanation of\nSome Perceptual Phenomena,&quot; British J o u m l of Psychology,\n58(1967):1-12. Both papers are reprintedin my Models of Thought,\nchapters 1.3 and 6.1.
