(-:\nAgain, EVERY TRACK ON HERE WAS and IS STILL BANGIN!!\n&quot;Tear The Roof Off The Sucker (Give Up The Funk!)&quot; became\ntheir first gold-selling single, peaking at #5 on the R&amp;B\ncharts and also doing well on the pop charts as well.\nIt became like their anthem during concerts during the\n'76-'78 era, played after the fervor following the landing\nof the Mothership onstage and the arrival of Dr. Funkenstein!! \n\nTomorrow I start adding some post Funkadelic/Parliament efforts by George Clinton, the father of them all, in .flac of course.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.
