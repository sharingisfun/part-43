Because of torrenting file limitations, I'm bundling these 95 albums into four different torrents today.  Three of the torrent bundles will contain 25 albums, with the fourth bundle housing 20 albums.  And specifically, this bundle (Bundle #1 of 4) contains 307 songs.\n\n\n\nSHARING REQUEST:\n\nThese four torrent bundles are larger in file size than the typical torrents that I've been sharing these past few months here on TPB.  Because of that, please consider holding onto, and sharing back what you download for a little while longer than perhaps you normally would.  Once these bundles are fully seeded, I &quot;WILL NOT&quot; stick around to continue to seed and support them.  At a combined total of 4.10 gigs, they're too large for me to devote continued bandwidth to.\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrentTracts, December 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9699721f7c2b9eace37ed79382ec5396d984ef7","amp;dn":"Christian+Christmas+Music+-+Bundle+1+of+4+-+25+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9699721f7c2b9eace37ed79382ec5396d984ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,105,151,33,247,194,185,234,206,55,237,121,56,46,197,57,109,152,78,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
