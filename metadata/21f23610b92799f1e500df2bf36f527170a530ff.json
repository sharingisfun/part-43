It's pretty difficult in\nreception and it's definitely one of these \nforgotten movies. Action takes place in Sopot,\nwhere Wagner who is some kind of fortuneteller\nand his sister who is a medium. They detect presence\nof a few people which are guided by insanely\npowerful medium. Those people meet in Sopot\n(where there is famous Polish pier shown later) but\nwhile controlled they are unaware what they did\nor what are they doing in that location.\nLater, an investigation carried out by detective\nand his deputy that sworn his loyalty to Nazis results in\nconclusion that this is repetition of a cycle in which...\nThe movie is accompanied by excellent music which enhances\nthe atmosphere of the mystery. Interestingly, casual dialogs\nare without any background music. \tIn addition to that we got\nsome historical background when Hitler started to rule in Germany\nalong with the party of the Nazis (NSDAP). To summarize, we receive\na very original Polish production, however it will be difficult\nto examine for those who don't like movies concerning psychological\nthings rather that gore and action. A must see for Polish horror lovers. \n\n=================================================\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 1\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                         : 1 752 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 436 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.651\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.223\nStream size                      : 1.10 GiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : DivX 6.8.5 (UTC 2009-08-20)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 29mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 144 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n=================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f23610b92799f1e500df2bf36f527170a530ff","amp;dn":"Medium-1985","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f23610b92799f1e500df2bf36f527170a530ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,242,54,16,185,39,153,241,229,0,223,43,243,111,82,113,112,165,48,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
