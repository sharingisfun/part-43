Multi-instrumentalists David Wax and Sue Slezak, along with several musical guests, fuse elements of Mexican folk with an original take on Nick Cave-esque spiritual/indie rock. Fiddles, accordions, guitars, horns, pounding piano, lots of percussion, powerful vocals and the odd backing choir of singers or multitracks come together in a new folk-gospel that has a bit of the offbeat sideshow tone that the pun on WaxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name suggests, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing gimmicky about the wonderful confluence of traditional and post-modern sounds. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/15/david-wax-museum/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e80dc6e4bc7e3f697c7d74150cf2a394b011a1ec","amp;dn":"David+Wax+Museum...Everything+is+Saved%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e80dc6e4bc7e3f697c7d74150cf2a394b011a1ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,13,198,228,188,126,63,105,124,125,116,21,12,242,163,148,176,17,161,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
