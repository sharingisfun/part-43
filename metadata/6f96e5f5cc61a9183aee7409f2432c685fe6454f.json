But what if he had and the manuscript was never found? Where would it be located? And what information would it reveal? These questions are the inspiration for the mathematical mystery novel Pythagoras' Revenge. Suspenseful and instructive, Pythagoras' Revenge weaves fact, fiction, mathematics, computer science, and ancient history into an entertaining story.\n\nJule Davidson, a young American mathematician, answers difficult math riddles on the Internet and stumbles upon a neo-Pythagorean sect searching for the promised reincarnation of Pythagoras. Across the ocean, Elmer Galway, a professor of classical history at Oxford, discovers an Arabic manuscript hinting at the existence of an ancient scroll--possibly left by Pythagoras himself. Unknown to one another, Jule and Elmer each have information that the other requires and, as they race to solve the philosophical and mathematical puzzles set before them, their paths ultimately collide. \n\nSet in 1998 with flashbacks to classical Greece, Pythagoras' Revenge investigates the confrontation between opposing views of mathematics and reality, and explores ideas from both early and cutting-edge mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f96e5f5cc61a9183aee7409f2432c685fe6454f","amp;dn":"Pythagoras%5C%27+Revenge+-+A+Mathematical+Mystery+%282009%29+%28Malestro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f96e5f5cc61a9183aee7409f2432c685fe6454f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,150,229,245,204,97,169,24,58,238,116,9,242,67,44,104,95,230,69,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
