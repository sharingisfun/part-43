The writing/directing team of brothers\n Peter and Bobby Farrelly confirm the old adage that two heads are better than one.\n The filmmaking duo has reinvented the comedy with films like Dumb and Dumber,\n There's Something About Mary, Me, Myself &amp; Irene and Fever Pitch, and The Heartbreak\n Kid. While riddled with humor, primarily of the slapstick and gross-out varieties,\n there is still always the sweet love story beneath it all. In this interview, find\n out what the Farrelly Brothers think about test screenings, surprising the audience,\n painting themselves into a corner, and why sometimes it's just not enough to make\n people laugh.\n\n\n  \n enjoy!                                                                  \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                     \n      Release notes                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                    \n                                                                     \n     Greetings                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d60c0fd29ba1d9da35a11f2a869b920205313b5","amp;dn":"The.Dialogue.Bobby.And.Peter.Farrelly.2007.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d60c0fd29ba1d9da35a11f2a869b920205313b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,96,192,253,41,186,29,157,163,90,17,242,168,105,185,32,32,83,19,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
