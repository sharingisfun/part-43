Ganja Plant\n10 Deadly Shots Vol. 1 (2011)\n\n\n\nHailing from upstate New York, surely one of the more unlikely locales for an authentic reggae act, 10 Ft. Ganja Plant are a mysterious roots and dub collective and splinter group of the better-known Ithaca, NY-based eight-piece John Brown's Body. Known for impromptu -- rarely announced or promoted -- live shows that incorporate a loose, improvisatory jam band feel, the group garnered some renown in the Northeast U.S. live music circuit throughout the 2000s. 10 Ft. Ganja Plant debuted in 2000 with the independently released Presents, a more dub-flavored, instrumental affair than anything released by their parent group. ROIR, no stranger to classic dub and reggae, signed the band in 2001, releasing their follow-up, Hillside Airstrip. The group soldiered on with three more releases for ROIR -- Midnight Landing (2003), Bass Chalice (2005), and Bushrock (2009) -- that revealed influences and echoes of '70s roots, from the close vocal harmonies of the Meditations to the dark, bass-heavy productions of Black Ark-era Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tKoch Imports\t\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Bonny &amp; Clyde\n02.Apache Kid\n03.Dillinger\nJames\n05.Belle Star\n06.Machine Gun\n07.Kid Curry\n08.Billy The Kid\n09.Black Bart\n10.The Sundance Kid\n\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d199578796d06292fe598c93ffb5591043ceb71f","amp;dn":"10+Ft.+Ganja+Plant+-+10+Deadly+Shots+Vol.+1+%282011%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d199578796d06292fe598c93ffb5591043ceb71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,153,87,135,150,208,98,146,254,89,140,147,255,181,89,16,67,206,183,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
