He had a diverse musical career, which included work for films. His music partakes of aspects of postmodernism--serial construction, atonal modalities, unusual instrumentation--and all of it hypnotic. The works on this disc are for a chamber-size orchestra and are illuminated by the smaller forces. From Me Flows What You Call Time (1990) brings to mind a set of delicate, atonal wind chimes. Twill by Twilight--In Memory of Morton Feldman (1988) reflects Feldman's juxtapositions and separations, but with a bit more color. Requiem (1957), Takemitsu's first orchestral work, is stunning and very beautiful. --Paul Cook\n\n\n\nboth FLAC and mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:146f9c0538516133a306b2ae83ef0dc29ba03cf1","amp;dn":"Takemitsu+Toru+-+From+me+flows+what+you+call+Time%3B+Twill+by+Twil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"146f9c0538516133a306b2ae83ef0dc29ba03cf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,111,156,5,56,81,97,51,163,6,178,174,131,239,13,194,155,160,60,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
