Their shows are an unique combination of percussion, movement and visual expression. Stomp uses just about anything, from brooms to trashcans, drumsticks to bananas, to make music.\n\nThis is their short cinematic from 1995 called &quot;Brooms&quot;.\nIf you like the genre The Blue Man Group is in, you 'll like this one too.\n\n\nSTOMP - Brooms.mkv is the following:\n\nContainer: Matroska (mkv)\n\nStream 0: Theora (video), 4096kbps, 25fps, 720x576.\nStream 1: Vorbis (audio), 384kbps, 3F2R/LFE (5.1) channels, 48000Hz.\nStream 2: Vorbis (audio), 192kbps, Stereo (2.0) 48000Hz.\n\nSource: STOMP Out Loud (DVD)\n\n\nThis video is shot in 1995 but they still do shows around the world to this day.\n\nWebsite: http://www.stomponline.com/tickets.php\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:656f52fda5a384083212b3a008082cca0f8156ec","amp;dn":"STOMP+-+Brooms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"656f52fda5a384083212b3a008082cca0f8156ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,111,82,253,165,163,132,8,50,18,179,160,8,8,44,202,15,129,86,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
