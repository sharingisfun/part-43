The video mainly consists of Chesney and many other people at an island-themed party at night, with people mingling, drinking, hanging out around a campfire and swimming in a large pool. Kenny is shown singing at the campfire with his guitar, wearing his signature cowboy hat, a sleeveless shirt and jeans and is barefoot, and he is also shown singing with his guitar on a diving board, wearing a sleeveless shirt and shorts and is barefoot.\n\n&quot;Out Last Night&quot; debuted at #25 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts dated for the week of April 11, 2009.[5] The song became Chesney's seventeenth Number One hit on the chart week of June 27, 2009 and his fourth consecutive chart-topper.  The song has now become his highest charting single on the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at #16 on the chart.\n\n&quot;Out Last Night&quot; is an up-tempo song in which the male narrator recalls a party that he attended the night before. He recalls the people that he met there (including &quot;girls from Argentina and Arkansas / Maine, Alabama and Panama&quot;), as well as his actions (such as lying to others after a few drinks, and telling them that he is &quot;a doctor, a lawyer, a senatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son / Brad PittÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s brother and a man on the run&quot;.) In the chorus, he says that &quot;Everybody was some kind of star when we went out last night.&quot; Co-written by Brett James and Chesney, it is the only new track on his second greatest hits album, 2009's Greatest Hits II.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28118ab48993aeccf2e44109b39607f577cf4b1e","amp;dn":"Kenny+Chesney+-+Out+Last+Night","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28118ab48993aeccf2e44109b39607f577cf4b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,17,138,180,137,147,174,204,242,228,65,9,179,150,7,245,119,207,75,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
