Told out of chronological order, these specific slices of love focus on all the things that make two people care for one another, be it something small like telling a joke or larger aspects of life, like the dreams that drive us or the secrets we keep. When put together, the pieces make a whole in the same way two lovers join as one.\n\nCrafted by Jamie S. Rich &amp; newcomer Joelle Jones, this beautiful and lyrical work is a unique experiment in graphic storytelling, combining the things we see with the words we say to give us a glimpse of everything we feel.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef8e2456dca13bb6eaaa7707e8464268d0138aba","amp;dn":"12+Reasons+Why+I+Love+Her","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef8e2456dca13bb6eaaa7707e8464268d0138aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,142,36,86,220,161,59,182,234,170,119,7,232,70,66,104,208,19,138,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
