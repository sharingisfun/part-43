Naomi (Jan Graveson), the archetypal experienced hooker. She welcomes him and with deft professionalism but becomes immediately apprehensive when he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to be after sex. When he rejects her advances and runs out the door, she assumes he is just a 'first-timer'. Until the next day, when he returns with up-front paymentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nAgainst NaomiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better judgement, she allows him in just to talk. He asks her all sorts of questions about her life and her trade, to the point of getting too personal and going too far. Naomi cuts him off abruptly, offended by his intrusion, and their session ends with Richard leaving sheepishly.\n\nWhen Richard returns and forces his way in, Naomi decides to make him work for the answers to his questions. Intrigued by his motivation for visiting yet still convinced that he is there for sex, Naomi imposes bargains and the currency exchanged between them escalates from hard cash to cheques to Monopoly money to clothing. The two form an unlikely friendship around their business arrangement grows into something very unusual.\n\nIt turns out that Richard does indeed want something from Naomi and that she can indeed provide it. Just what that something is, is very unexpectedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nFor those of us who continue to wave the flag for British cinema, perennially undermined by poor scripts or craven overtures to the States, maintaining such respect is very often like trying to love a puppy that keeps crapping on the duvet. So it's a joy when you stumble across a no-budget homegrown sporting great writing, even better performances ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and which doesn't compromise to anyone. Winstone is the mystery john who visits Naomi the prostitute (a terrific debut from Graveson) over 9 consecutive days (the film was shot in 9 days too), without once soliciting sex. He just wants to talk; to find out why she does what she does. On the penultimate day, he even brings a Monopoly set round. If the climax doesn't come as a surprise exactly, the emotional impact remains intact, aided by heartfelt, beautifully understated performances from the cast, including Winstone's real-life daughter. See it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44e4b431b7ade3d48a718d0491dbd683650d0a9","amp;dn":"Everything+-+%28Ray+Winstone+-+Jan+Graveson%29%282004%29%5BDvdRip-DivX-Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44e4b431b7ade3d48a718d0491dbd683650d0a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,78,75,67,27,122,222,61,72,167,24,208,73,29,189,104,54,80,208,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
