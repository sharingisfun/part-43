Blackfoot - The Ultimate Prophecy\n\nFormed from the ashes of other local bands in Ohio in 1969, J.D. Blackfoot unleashed this stunning blend of folk, country and hard psychedelia in 1970. Though the band was short-lived, their sole album has gone on to be recognized as an all-time rock classic, featuring searing lead guitar and some of the best drumming ever recorded. \n\n1.\tOne Time Woman\n2.\tAngel\n3.\tWe Can Try\n4.\tGood Day\n5.\tExtending Company\n6.\tI've Never Seen You\n7.\tThe Ultimate Prophecy\n8.\tDeath's Finale\n9.\tCycles\n10.\tWaiting to Be Born\n11.\tPink Sun\n\nAll of my rips are from the original CD and have embedded cover art.
