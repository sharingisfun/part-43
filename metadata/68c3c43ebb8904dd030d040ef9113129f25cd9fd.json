This has been floating around the interwebs for a while now. But none of the versions seemed to work properly or were dead. So I just updated it to a working cider wrapper and am re-upping it.\n\nHopefully someone more talented than me will take it on themselves to try and get some of the newer versions working. But until then, this remains the only major working football game for Mac.\n\nJoga Bonito!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c3c43ebb8904dd030d040ef9113129f25cd9fd","amp;dn":"Fifa+05+%28Mac%29+Intel-Cider","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c3c43ebb8904dd030d040ef9113129f25cd9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,195,196,62,187,137,4,221,3,13,4,14,249,17,49,41,242,92,217,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
