The game is a sequel to the 2002 Disney Interactive and Square collaboration, Kingdom Hearts, which combined Disney and Square elements into an action role-playing game, though it is significantly darker in tone than its predecessor. The game's popularity has resulted in a novel and manga series based upon it and an international version called Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, released in March 2007.\n\nKingdom Hearts II is the third game in the Kingdom Hearts series. It picks up one year after the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories.[2] Sora, the protagonist of the first two games, returns to search for his lost friends.[3] Like the previous games, Kingdom Hearts II features a large cast of characters from Disney films and Final Fantasy games. Organization XIII, a group introduced in Chain of Memories, also reappears to impede Sora's progress.\n\nThe game was well-received, earning year-end awards from numerous video gaming websites. In Japan, it shipped more than one million copies within a week of its release. One month after its North American release, it had sold over one million copies and was the second best-selling game of 2006.[4] As of March 31, 2007, the game has shipped over 4 million copies worldwide.[5]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84101790a947466e2083e360b346c743049560d5","amp;dn":"Kingdom.Hearts.2.%5BNTSC%5D.%5Bisorip%5D.%5BX0.%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84101790a947466e2083e360b346c743049560d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,16,23,144,169,71,70,110,32,131,227,96,179,70,199,67,4,149,96,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
