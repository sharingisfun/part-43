Drawing on his extensive teaching and scene-painting experience, William H. Pinnell clarifies and expands on the lessons of the first edition, providing a detailed overview of the fundamentals of traditional scene painting.\n\nThe guide not only covers the basic tools of the trade and various methods of creating texture on scenery but also includes more advanced techniques for scene making, beginning with stonework, woodwork, and wallpaper before moving on to the more intricate techniques of moldings, paneling, drapery, foliage, shiny metal, perspective illusions, scale transfers, scenic drops, and scrims. Pinnell also includes refinements and embellishments that can lead to the development of personal style without sacrificing the goal of realism and more advanced work. Alternative methods to achieve different effects are also featured.\n\nTheatrical Scene Painting: A Lesson Guide was the first book of its kind to provide clear step-by-step instructions in how to paint a wide variety of basic and advanced effects commonly needed for the theater. This new edition clarifies the origins of painting techniques and is supplemented with clearer step-by-step descriptions, new instructional photographs, and drawings that illustrate each major step. This edition also includes additional painting projects and their possible variations, a gallery of nineteen examples of professional scenic works, and an expanded glossary to eliminate confusion in terms.\n\nUseful to both self-taught artists and students, each lesson in the guide can be a stand-alone topic or can form the foundation for a student to build skills for increasingly complex techniques.\n\nThe second edition of Theatrical Scene Painting provides many new essential scene painting projects in a clearer format, broadens the scope of the painting examples, and includes updated methods as well as new lessons. This clear and easily accessible guide gives students the ability to put together recognizable illusions.\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f158811cfb7deeb30543d4874c5ca264f5deda5","amp;dn":"Theatrical+Scene+Painting+2nd+Edition+%5BPDF%5D+-+Oceanhawk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f158811cfb7deeb30543d4874c5ca264f5deda5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,21,136,17,207,183,222,235,48,84,61,72,116,197,202,38,79,93,237,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
