King &amp; Eric Clapton - Riding with the King (2000)\n\nReprise @192 kbps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis CD should satisfy fans of King, Clapton and blues purists alike. Unlike the sometimes strained vocals on Clapton's 1994 blues album From The Cradle, there is nothing forced about this collaboration.\n\nSome of these songs are reworkings of some of King's earliest sides like 1951's &quot;Three O'Clock Blues,&quot; where King's single-note leads are balanced against Clapton's more fluid runs. And Joe Sample's piano playing is stellar throughout. Or the slow blues of 1954's &quot;Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot; and 1955's shuffling &quot;Ten Long Years&quot;.\n\nWhether they're playing the slow blues of 1954's &quot;Heart Beats Like a Hammer&quot; and 1955's shuffling &quot;Ten Long Years&quot;, the acoustic blues of Big Bill Broonzy's &quot;Key To The Highway,&quot; a funky version of the Sam and Dave classic &quot;Hold On I'm Coming&quot; or the electrifying &quot;Days Of Old,&quot;  these two artists play the blues with conviction. \n\n\nAnd the supporting cast is superb, including guitarists Andy Fairweather Low and Texas blues sensation Doyle Bramhall II. (In fact, two of Bramhalls's songs from last year's Jellycream--&quot;Marry You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be&quot;--are included here.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Riding with the King&quot; (John Hiatt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:23\n   2. &quot;Ten Long Years&quot; (B.B.
