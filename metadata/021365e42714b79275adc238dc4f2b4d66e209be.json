As a songwriter, he pioneered several different schools of pop songwriting, from confessional singer/songwriter to winding, hallucinatory, stream-of-consciousness narratives. As a vocalist, he broke down the notion that a singer must have a conventionally good voice in order to perform, thereby redefining the vocalist's role in popular music. As a musician, he sparked several genres of pop music, including electrified folk-rock and country-rock. And that just touches on the tip of his achievements. Dylan's force was evident during his height of popularity in the '60s -- the Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-'60s never would have happened without him -- but his influence echoed throughout several subsequent generations, as many of his songs became popular standards and his best albums became undisputed classics of the rock &amp; roll canon. Dylan's influence throughout folk music was equally powerful, and he marks a pivotal turning point in its 20th century evolution, signifying when the genre moved away from traditional songs and toward personal songwriting. Even when his sales declined in the '80s and '90s, Dylan's presence rarely lagged, and his commercial revival in the 2000s proved his staying power. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel: \t\t\tSony\nOriginal Release Date:\t1975\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 Tangled Up In Blue\n02 Simple Twist Of Fate\n03 You're A Big Girl Now\n04 Idiot Wind\n05 You're Going To Make Me Lonesome When You Go\n06 Meet Me In The Morning\n07 Lily, Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts\n08 If You See Her, Say Hello\n09 Shelter From The Storm\n10 Buckets Of Rain\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
