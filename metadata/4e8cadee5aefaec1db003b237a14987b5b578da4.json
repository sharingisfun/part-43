Chocolate News aired satirical pieces and sketches about current events and news stories. The show satirized these stories with a focus on how Grier thinks typical African Americans view them. Sketches were directed by Rusty Cundieff, who directed the most sketches on Chappelle's Show.\n\n\n#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-\nThe show ran for one season in 2008 on Comedy Central. Ten episodes in all, but I couldn't find the last one.\n\nPLEASE SEED!! The other Chocolate News torrents are dead.
