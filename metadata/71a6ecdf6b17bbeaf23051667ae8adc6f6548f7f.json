It is the first movie soundtrack to feature one rap act exclusively--in this case, genre pioneers Public Enemy. The first Public Enemy album in four years (since 1994's Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age), what is also notable about the album is that members of Public Enemy's founding producers, the Bomb Squad, return to oversee several tracks. The concept album explores the dark side of professional basketball culture and its toll on the largely African-American players in its ranks: The pressure from family, friends and especially big-business interests, leading to what Chuck D calls &quot;a house built off of them skulls and bones&quot; in &quot;House of the Rising Son&quot;. The title track is a great meld of hip-hop &amp; classic rock: it samples Buffalo Springfield's &quot;For What it's Worth&quot; and features a guest spot from Stephen Stills himself. Some of the other great songs include &quot;Go Cat Go!&quot; (produced by Meat Beat Manifesto's Jack Dangers), &quot;Game Face&quot; (which hijacks Monty Norman's James Bond theme), &quot;Unstoppable&quot; (with guest vocalist KRS-One) and the gospel-style hook of &quot;What You Need is Jesus&quot;(The reason I bought this CD). Flavor Flav's bouncy spotlight track is the self-explanatory &quot;Shake Your Booty&quot;. The closing track is the spoken-word piece &quot;Game Over&quot;, where Professor Griff muses on behalf of the frequently-criticized `hip-hop ballplayer': &quot;Yeah, I got an attitude; How'd you figure?&quot; \n\nTrack Listings\n1.
