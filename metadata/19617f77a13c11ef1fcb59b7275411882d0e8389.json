Leaders are now declaring that world government has\narrived and that the dollar will be replaced with a new global currency.\n\n\nPresident Obama has brazenly violated Article I Section 9 of the U.S.\nConstitution by seating himself at the head of United NationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Security Council,\nthus becoming the first U.S. President to chair the world body. \n\nA scientific dictatorship is in its final stages of completion, and laws\nprotecting basic human rights are being abolished worldwide; an iron curtain of\nhigh-tech tyranny is now descending over the planet. \n\nA worldwide regime controlled by an unelected corporate elite is implementing a\nplanetary carbon tax system that will dominate all human activity and establish\na system of neo-feudal slavery. \n\nThe image makers have carefully packaged Obama as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s savior; he is the\nTrojan Horse manufactured to pacify the people just long enough for the\nglobalists to complete their master plan. \n\nThis film reveals the architecture of the New World Order and what the power\nelite have in store for humanity. More importantly it communicates how We the\nPeople can retake control of our government, turn the criminal tide and bring\nthe tyrants to justice. \n\nMAKE THE CHOICE: LIBERTY OR TYRANNY \n\npresents an Alex Jones film\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFall of the Republic: The Presidency of Barack H.
