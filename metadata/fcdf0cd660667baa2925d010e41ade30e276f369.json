So what I have done is uncompiled the .cbr files back into the original .jpeg scans used to make up the .cbr files. I thought other fans of this series may want to do the same so I'm sharing them here. I also included the original .cbr files for hose who may have an incomplete collection.\n\nEnjoy and please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdf0cd660667baa2925d010e41ade30e276f369","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Comics++1-82+jpegs+scans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdf0cd660667baa2925d010e41ade30e276f369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,223,12,214,96,102,123,170,41,37,208,16,228,26,222,48,226,118,243,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
