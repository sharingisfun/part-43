It was released on October 21, 1997 by Red Ant Entertainment. Red Ant filed bankruptcy before the album was really released. Salt-n-Pepa toured to support the album, despite the fact the album had no other promotion whatsoever. Brand New had two minor hits: &quot;R U Ready&quot; and &quot;Gitty Up&quot;, the latter of which samples the Rick James song &quot;Give it to Me&quot;.\n\n\n\nGreat catchy song\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41209f29106ff1e3e3e39c25aa2f629884beea51","amp;dn":"Salt+n+Pepa+-+Gitty+Up+%5B1999%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41209f29106ff1e3e3e39c25aa2f629884beea51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,32,159,41,16,111,241,227,227,227,156,37,170,47,98,152,132,190,234,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
