The single was released in October 1992 by Maverick Records, and later included on her greatest hits albums GHV2 (2001) and Celebration (2009). Released amidst a blaze of publicity and hype for the single and other projects at the time, &quot;Erotica&quot; became her first lead single from an album not to hit number one in the U.S. since her debut album in 1983. Fourteen years after its original release, the song received renewed attention with its inclusion in the set list for the Confessions Tour. The song, along with &quot;Secret Garden&quot;, were the only Madonna songs used in her feature film debut as a director, Filth and Wisdom (2007).\n\n&quot;Erotica&quot; continued Madonna's exploration of potent spoken-word vocals (as introduced in &quot;Justify My Love&quot;) and was highly controversial when it was released due to its sexual theme and suggestive lyrics. Upon the song's release, the Vatican banned Madonna from entering the state and her music was banned on its radio stations. The song and its accompanying album are also banned in Lebanon.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Erotica&quot; is one of Madonna's most famous videos, directed by fashion photographer Fabien Baron. The clip depicts Madonna as a mask-wearing dominatrix; interspersed are scenes from the making of the Sex book. The American MTV aired it a total of three times (all of these in the &quot;safe harbor&quot;) due to its highly charged sexual content, and was eventually Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by that channel. There are two versions of the video - the &quot;standard&quot; version which contained no nudity was released in the United States (it can be viewed on Madonna's official web page); and a more explicit version of the video was released only in Europe and Australia, which contained full-frontal nudity of Madonna and variation in the editing. The video was ranked #16 on VH1's &quot;50 Sexiest Video Moments&quot;.\n\nNaomi Campbell, Isabella Rossellini, and Big Daddy Kane appeared in Madonna's music video for &quot;Erotica&quot;. The footage of Madonna performing the song in her S&amp;M dominatrix costume was shot on August 22, 1992 at The Kitchen in New York City. The rest of the footage for the video was shot during the New York City photo sessions for her infamous book Sex (many of the photographs in the book are actually stills from this footage) - an hour of this footage was compiled by Madonna and Baron for a film that was made for the party she gave at Industria in New York for the release of Sex, a film that included a soundtrack of French music from the 1920s and 1930s that included songs from such singers as Charles Trenet, Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, Edith Piaf, and Josephine Baker. This film was also given by Madonna to her closest friends. It later leaked out to the public and copies of it were sold on eBay for some time. Today this film, known as the Sex Book Video can be found circulating on the internet in low quality.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f0768c99abcccc7dabf023a7e31910f409b7ae","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+Erotica++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f0768c99abcccc7dabf023a7e31910f409b7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,240,118,140,153,171,204,204,125,171,240,35,167,227,25,16,244,9,183,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
