That primal separation (which is no less stunning for happening off-screen) is the centerpiece of Bambi, Walt Disney's 1942 animated classic, but it is by no means the only bold stroke in the film. In its swift but somehow leisurely 69 minutes, Bambi covers a year in the life of a young deer. But in a bigger way, it measures the life cycle itself, from birth to adulthood, from childhood's freedom to grown-up responsibility. All of this is rendered in cheeky, fleet-footed style--the movie doesn't lecture, or make you feel you're being fed something that's good for you. The animation is miraculous, a lush forest in which nature is a constantly unfolding miracle (even in a spectacular fire, or those dark moments when &quot;man was in the forest&quot;). There are probably easier animals to draw than a young deer, and the Disney animators set themselves a challenge with Bambi's wobbly glide across an ice-covered lake, his spindly legs akimbo; but the sequence is effortless and charming. If Bambi himself is just a bit dull--such is the fate of an Everydeer--his rabbit sidekick Thumper and a skunk named Flower more than make up\nfor it. Many of the early Disney features have their share of lyrical moments and universal truths, but Bambi is so simple, so pure, it's almost transparent. You might borrow a phrase from Thumper and say it's downright twitterpated.\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 700 MiB\nDuration : 1h 7mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 446 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2009-07-31 03:45:12\nTagged date : UTC 2009-07-31 06:21:17\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.9.3 2008112300\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6b260a02052b275f455b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 7mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 1 284 Kbps\nWidth : 520 pixels\nHeight : 376 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.383\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 12.500 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 25.000 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.263\nStream size : 621 MiB (89%)\nWriting library : x264 core 65\n\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nFormat settings, SBR : No\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 1h 7mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 158 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 232 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 76.5 MiB (11%)\nEncoded date : UTC 2009-07-31 03:45:13\nTagged date : UTC 2009-07-31 06:21:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e7f34ba5c477453d9fdee1dd9e335a4d9a3b07a","amp;dn":"DISNEYS-BAMBI+1942+H.264+BY+STIG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e7f34ba5c477453d9fdee1dd9e335a4d9a3b07a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,127,52,186,92,71,116,83,217,253,238,29,217,227,53,164,217,163,176,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
