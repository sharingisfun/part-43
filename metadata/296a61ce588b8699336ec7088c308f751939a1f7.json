This album's not only packed with fanciful guitar solos and fervent singing, it shows Guy's full range as an artist. His powerful testifying on &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Knock On Wood&quot; nail his credentials as a soul singer. &quot;I Had a Dream Last Night&quot; captures the sensitivity and emotional depth of his blues. And the charging &quot;I Got My Eyes On You&quot; nips at Jimi Hendrix's boots as it reveals Guy as a source of sonic inspiration to that Voodoo Chile. --Ted Drozdowski\n\nTracklist\n1.
