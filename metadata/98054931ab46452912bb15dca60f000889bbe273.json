Others may see The Circle as never ending. I see it as very hard to get in to and even harder to get out of. Having had 5 studio records in this decade, there are songs on each record that represent the world around us. And while they don't always like what they see, they try hard not to see the cup as half empty.&quot;\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Bon Jovi - The Circle\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Bon Jovi\nAlbum................: The Circle\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2009\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; HP CD-Writer+ 8290\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.1, ID3 v2.3\n\nRipped by............: Asad on 13-11-2009\nPosted by............: Asad on 17-11-2009\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  1.
