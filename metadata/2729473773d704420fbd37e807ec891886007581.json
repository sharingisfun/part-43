The only other torrent of this file size available was ripped from VHS and out of sync, hence the need for this one.\n\nSource: DVD (does not include Menu, commentary track, or any extras)\n\n*** VIDEO INFO ***\nCodec Type : XVID (de-interlaced by blending fields)\nFrame Size : 640 x 480\nFrameRate(Frame/sec) : 29.97 progressive\n\n\n*** AUDIO INFO ***\nCodec Type: Lame MP3 VBR\nSampleRate(Sample/sec) : 48000\nBitRate(Bit/sample) : 16\nChannels : 2\nAvgBitRate(KBit/sec) : 176\n\n\nEnglish subtitles for commentary track:\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/download/sub/3535738\n\nThis video doesn't have the actual commentary track but you can see what the guy is saying via the subtitles as you listen to the music. Actually a better way of absorbing the commentary if you ask me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2729473773d704420fbd37e807ec891886007581","amp;dn":"U2+-+Live+at+Red+Rocks%3A+Under+a+Blood+Red+Sky+%5BDVDrip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2729473773d704420fbd37e807ec891886007581","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,41,71,55,115,215,4,66,15,189,55,232,7,236,137,24,134,0,117,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
