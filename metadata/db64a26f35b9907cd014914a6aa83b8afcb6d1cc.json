Taking care of little Matt and fixing up his run-down ranch house with its old barn loosens something tightly wound inside him. But when Steven takes on the pro bono defense of a local teen, he meets his match in the opposing counselÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½beautiful, by-the-book county prosecutor Melissa O'Ballivan. It'll take one grieving little boy, a sweet adopted dog and a woman who never expected to win any man's heart to make this Creed in Stone Creek know he's truly found home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db64a26f35b9907cd014914a6aa83b8afcb6d1cc","amp;dn":"A+Creed+in+Stone+Creek+-+Linda+Lael+Miller.lit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db64a26f35b9907cd014914a6aa83b8afcb6d1cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,100,162,111,53,185,144,124,208,20,145,74,106,168,59,138,252,182,209,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
