It was recorded November 26, 2004 at the Air Canada \nCentre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during The Hip's In Between Evolution\n tour. It differs from most concert DVDs in the fact that nothing was \nedited out of the set. It is not a composite of several different shows, \nand the chronology is exactly that of the actual concert, one that was not\n booked or in any way influenced by or for the filming of the DVD. Originally \nreleased November 1, 2005, as a part of the Hipeponymous box-set, it was\n released separately on November 8, 2005. The audio is exclusively available\n from the iTunes Music Store. The title of the DVD is taken from a line of the\n popular Hip song &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot;, which was included in the concert's set, much\n to the pleasure of the crowd at the Air Canada Centre that evening.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1bd30e08da6acdb4dc4a82d9f1194acf53d171e","amp;dn":"The+Tragically+Hip+-+That+Night+in+Toronto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1bd30e08da6acdb4dc4a82d9f1194acf53d171e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,189,48,224,141,166,172,219,77,196,168,45,159,17,148,172,245,61,23,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
