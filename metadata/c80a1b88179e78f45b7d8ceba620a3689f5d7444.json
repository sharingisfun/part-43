The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c80a1b88179e78f45b7d8ceba620a3689f5d7444","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+Connect+-+Blue+-+8.162+-+English+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c80a1b88179e78f45b7d8ceba620a3689f5d7444","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,10,27,136,23,158,120,244,91,125,140,235,166,32,163,104,159,93,116,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
