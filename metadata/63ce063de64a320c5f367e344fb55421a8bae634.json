During its lifespan it covered emerging, overlooked and mainstream music with idiosyncratic, challenging writing and stunning photography and illustration throughout, giving early and valuable exposure to many new musicians, writers and artists.\n\nPlan B was about the music we, its creators, loved, and it was about questioning the orthodoxies and attitudes of the mainstream music press. We would like it to be available to everyone. \n\nThis torrent contains PDFs of all 46 back issues of plan B.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ce063de64a320c5f367e344fb55421a8bae634","amp;dn":"Entire+back+catalog+of+Plan+B+magazine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ce063de64a320c5f367e344fb55421a8bae634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,206,6,61,230,74,50,12,95,54,126,52,79,181,84,33,168,186,230,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
