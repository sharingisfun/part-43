The Stranger Song\n5. Sisters of Mercy\n6. So Long, Marianne\n7. Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\n8. Stories of the Street\n9. Teachers\n10. One of Us Cannot Be Wrong\n\nSuzanne: Here is the first track from Record Club No. 2. This time around the group includes Devendra Banhart, Ben, Andrew and Will from MGMT, Andrew from Wolfmother, Binki from Little Joy, and Brian and Bram returning from the first Record Club. For those new to the Record Club, it is an informal meeting of various musicians to record an album in a day. An album is chosen to be reinterpreted and used as a framework. Nothing rehearsed or arranged ahead of time. A track is put up here once a week. As you will hear, some of the songs are rough renditions, often first takes documenting what happened over the course of a day. There is no intention to 'add to' the original work or attempt to recreate the power of the original recording. Only to play music and document what happens. And those who aren't familiar with the albums in question will hopefully look for the songs in their definitive versions. 'Songs Of Leonard Cohen' by Leonard Cohen was chosen by Andrew from MGMT. For those interested, our close second choice was Ace Of Base, which we'll keep on the list for next time.\n\nSo Long, Marianne: Devendra takes the lead this time, while Andrew gets on the kit.\n\n==============\n\nThis torrent includes the original .mp4 video files posted on Beck's vimeo.com site (http://www.vimeo.com/videotheque). They were ripped with clipnabber.com and are the original files uploaded by Beck, not the vimeo stream, not the vimeo re-encode.\n\nThe flac and mp3's, therefore, are clean rips from the best possible available source (the original mp4 videos) and are not sourced from the vimeo stream or the re-encoded / compressed vimeo files.\n\nEnjoy this in the highest quality available until Beck officially releases it, if he does.\n\n- RandyB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2363a8ae27283b4e30b241ba7e21c38982a891b","amp;dn":"Beck+-+Record+Club+2+-+Songs+of+Leonard+Cohen+%28MP4%2C+MP3%2C+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2363a8ae27283b4e30b241ba7e21c38982a891b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,54,58,138,226,114,131,180,227,11,36,27,167,226,28,56,152,42,137,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
