Ruess left Arizona to develop his career in New York City. Ruess formed the band with Andrew Dost of Anathallo and Jack Antonoff of Steel Train. Fun recorded their debut album, Aim and Ignite in August 2008 with producer Steven McDonald and arranger Roger Joseph Manning Jr., the former keyboardist of Jellyfish.\n\nFun made its first single, &quot;At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be)&quot; available as a free download by signing up for the band's mailing list.&quot; In addition, the band announced that if Fun's Facebook page reached 40,000 fans by December 1st, a new Christmas single, &quot;Believe In Me,&quot; would be released for free download. This goal was met, and Fun did indeed release the single for free.\n\nIn February of 2010, Fun supported Jack's Mannequin on their headline tour, along with Vedera which was followed by their first UK appearances in March. Their current touring band also includes Rob Kroehler, Emily Moore, Nate Harold, and Jon &quot;Jonny Thunder&quot; Goldstein.\n\nIn April of 2010, Fun supported Paramore's headline tour. Other support for the tour includes Relient K[8].The band then embarked on a full UK tour in May.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_%28band%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_%28band%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAim and Ignite is the debut album from indie pop band fun. It was released on August 25, 2009. The two bonus tracks are re-imagined versions of two other songs on the CD. The title of the album comes from the track &quot;Light a Roman Candle with Me.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_and_Ignite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aim_and_Ignite&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&quot;AIM AND IGNITE&quot; is up-to-the-minute pop, vibrant and alive, with no boundaries to restrain its passion and resourcefulness. Take, for example, &quot;At Least I'm Not As Sad (As I Used To Be),&quot; which suggests the heretofore unimagined sound of Caribbean Queen, with Ruess belting extravagantly over a backdrop of festive horns and steel drums. &quot;Barlights&quot; - arranged by longtime Ruess fave Roger Joseph Manning Jr. (Jellyfish, Imperial Drag, Moog Cookbook) - is brash and brassy blue-eyed soul, while Dost's &quot;Light A Roman Candle With Me&quot; is rollicking and Randy Newman-esque, spiked by Antonoff's unexpectedly edgy guitars. From song to song, &quot;AIM AND IGNITE&quot; abounds with creative vigor, fusing complex gospel-inspired harmonies and sophisticated theatrical melodies onto the pop rock framework.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bighassle.com/fun/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bighassle.com/fun/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAC Tracklist:\n\n01.
