It is shot entirely in Xhosa, and combines both music from the original opera with traditional African music. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha. It was translated into Xhosa by Andiswa Kedama and Pauline Malefane, who also play Amanda and Carmen in the movie. The movie tells the story of a cigarette factory-worker, Carmen, and her doomed love affair with police sergeant Jongikhaya.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0cf3f709d244b838026ec2593c9c3e789354a03","amp;dn":"Mark+Dornford-May+-+U-Carmen+Khayelitsha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0cf3f709d244b838026ec2593c9c3e789354a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,207,63,112,157,36,75,131,128,38,236,37,147,201,195,231,137,53,74,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
