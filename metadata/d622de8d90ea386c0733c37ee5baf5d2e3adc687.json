He died of an overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. \n\nThis collaborative tribute to Hendrix, described by one of its creators as &quot;not so much outright biography as speculative fantasy,&quot; explores the excitement and the pitfalls of rock stardom sympathetically and perceptively. Lavishly and beautifully illustrated by Sienkiewicz (Electra: Assassin), this draws on the layout and narrative style of comic books to recreate Hendrix's life in a more impressionistic manner than standard bios typically permit. Much of the text is drawn from Hendrix's own letters, poetry and lyrics.  Also included is a CD collecting seven previously unreleased tracks written and performed by Hendrix.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d622de8d90ea386c0733c37ee5baf5d2e3adc687","amp;dn":"Voodoo+Child+-+The+Illustrated+Legend+of+Jimi+Hendrix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d622de8d90ea386c0733c37ee5baf5d2e3adc687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,34,222,141,144,234,56,108,7,51,195,126,229,186,245,210,227,173,198,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
