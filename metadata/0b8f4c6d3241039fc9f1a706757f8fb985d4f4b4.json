E. M. Cool\n\n\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press 2007 | 304 Pages | ISBN: 0521802768 | PDF | 1 MB\n\n\n\nWhat were the eating and drinking habits of the inhabitants of Britain during the Roman period? Drawing on evidence from a large number of archaeological excavations, this fascinating new study shows how varied these habits were in different regions and amongst different communities and challenges the idea that there was any one single way of being Roman or native. \n\nIntegrating a range of archaeological sources, including pottery, metalwork and environmental evidence such as animal bone and seeds, this book illuminates eating and drinking choices, providing invaluable insights into how those communities regarded their world. \n\nThe book contains sections on the nature of the different types of evidence used and how this can be analysed. It will be a useful guide to all archaeologists and those who wish to learn about the strength and weaknesses of this material and how best to use it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b8f4c6d3241039fc9f1a706757f8fb985d4f4b4","amp;dn":"Eating+and+Drinking+in+Roman+Britain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b8f4c6d3241039fc9f1a706757f8fb985d4f4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,143,76,109,50,65,3,159,201,241,167,6,117,127,143,185,133,212,244,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
