America, Steyn argues, will have to stand alone. The world will be divided between America and the rest; and for our sake America had better win.\nFrom the Inside Flap\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the end of the world as we know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\nSomeday soon, you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin. Europeans already are.\n\nAnd liberals will still tell you that &quot;diversity is our strength&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops, the Supreme Court decides sharia law doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t violate the &quot;separation of church and state,&quot; and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy.\n\nIf you think this canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happen, you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been paying attention, as the hilarious, provocative, and brilliant Mark SteynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the most popular conservative columnist in the English-speaking worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shows to devastating effect in this, his first and eagerly awaited new book on American and global politics.\n\nThe future, as Steyn shows, belongs to the fecund and the confident. And the Islamists are both, while the WestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½wedded to a multiculturalism that undercuts its own confidence, a welfare state that nudges it toward sloth and self-indulgence, and a childlessness that consigns it to oblivionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization.\n\nEurope, laments Steyn, is almost certainly a goner. The future, if the West has one, belongs to America aloneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with maybe its cousins in brave Australia. But America can survive, prosper, and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself, in the sturdier virtues of self-reliance (not government), in the centrality of family, and in the conviction that our country really is the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last best hope.\n\nSteyn argues that, contra the liberal cultural relativists, America should proclaim the obvious: we do have a better government, religion, and culture than our enemies, and we should spread AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence around the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for our own sake as well as theirs.\n\nMark SteynÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s America Alone is laugh-out-loud funnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but it will also change the way you look at the world. It is sure to be the most talked-about book of the year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd04ed23f2a1e2ef6bc73df132f51de3e7c89a2e","amp;dn":"Mark+Steyn++America+Alone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd04ed23f2a1e2ef6bc73df132f51de3e7c89a2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,4,237,35,242,161,226,239,107,199,61,241,50,245,29,227,231,200,154,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
