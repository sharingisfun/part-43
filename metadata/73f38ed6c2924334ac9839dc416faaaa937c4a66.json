I'm digging way down here...but I see there are a few\nMaria Muldaur fans on TPB.\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nMaria Muldaur is the eponymous 1973 first solo release of musician Maria Muldaur. The album includes Muldaur's best-known single, &quot;Midnight at the Oasis&quot;, which charted at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and &quot;Three Dollar Bill&quot;, which charted at #7 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts. The album, which peaked at #3 on The Billboard 200, was certified gold by the RIAA on May 13, 1974.[1]  Writing in October of 1973, Rolling Stone's reviewer Jon Landau described the album as &quot;one of the half-dozen best&quot; of the year, &quot;the kind of glorious breakthrough that reminds me why I fell in love with rock &amp; roll.&quot;  The album is heavily influenced by country  and blues.\n\n\nCD: Maria Muldaur - Maria Muldaur 1973\n01.
