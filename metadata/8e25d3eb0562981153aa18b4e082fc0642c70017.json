There's a lot of confidence here, evidenced by kicking off with &quot;Barleycorn,&quot; a version of one of the best-known songs given a fresh, original, and quite catchy arrangement before heading out from there. As he'd proved before, he's a very tidy box player, and he uses stalwart backing here, although perhaps the biggest revelation is his singing. It's not obtrusive, but certainly quite persuasive, especially on &quot;Fair Ellen of Ratcliffe,&quot; an epic and gruesome tale that stands as the disc's centerpiece before haring off into some modern and quite effective folk-rock. Good as this album is overall, not everything works. &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; suffers from an arrangement that's too cute by far, but also amorphous, while &quot;Twelve Joys of Mary&quot; seems to lack any focus or seriousness, a kind of English oompah. Cast those two aside and Van Eyken has made an impressive move ahead on a solo career. \n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/22/tim-van-eyken/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e25d3eb0562981153aa18b4e082fc0642c70017","amp;dn":"Tim+van+Eyken...Stiffs+Lovers+Holymen+Thieves%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e25d3eb0562981153aa18b4e082fc0642c70017","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,37,211,235,5,98,152,17,83,170,24,180,224,130,252,6,66,199,0,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
