The first and, until now, only album by Fogerty and the Rangers was issued 36 years ago; the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ consisted of Fogerty, who played all the instruments and sang all the parts on the tribute to old-time country and gospel music.  On the new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Fogerty is joined by crack musicians Jay Bellerose, Dennis Crouch, Greg Leisz, Herb Pederson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and Bruce Springsteen on a cover of the Everly BrothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen Will I Be LovedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the EaglesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmidt on Rick NelsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGarden Party.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\n\n\nInterview with The Wall Street Journal:  \n\n\nHow did you pick the songs for the new album?\n\nMost of them IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been carrying  around with me for a long time.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m kind of always collecting songs.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been in the back of my mind to do another Blue Ridge Rangers album, so when IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d hear a song IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d think, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat would be good for that.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAny particular reason you didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play all the instruments yourself this time?\n\nOh yeah.  On the first one, it was a lot of work.  Really more than most musicians have to go through when you have other people carrying the load for you.  About a week after it was done, I felt the feeling of the music wouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been better if I had other really good musicians on it.  But I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t running in that kind of circle back then. I told myself the next time IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m going to get really good guys.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very nice vibe on the new album.  Were the sessions as mellow as they seem? \n\nPretty much.  That was very important to me.  Sometimes, you get good people together and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as stiff as a board, with guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s showing off or stepping on the other guyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thing.  It can come out corporate-sounding and I sure didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want that.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got this album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Great Dobro SessionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Jerry Douglas.  He got a lot of his idols and friends together and he surrounded himself with good people and they had a really great time.  I was going for that.\nThese sessions were so exciting.  I would say joyful.  They understood my concept of the Blue Ridge Rangers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a certain way of doing it, an attitude.  These guys translated that feeling.  The joyfulness is more important than the particular music thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s being played.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m very happy with it.\n\nHow did the duet with Springsteen come about?\n\nMy wife Julie picked some of the songs.  She wanted me to do ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen Will I Be Loved,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and in her vision she wanted me to sing it with Bruce Springsteen.  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been wanting to do something with Bruce for a long time.  With her added blessing, it was done.\n\nThat line in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGarden PartyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t please everyone so youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got to please yourselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ does that resonate with you?\n\nVery much.  I realize thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a certain segment thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not going to like this record.  You know, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI hate country music or why is John singing soft.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  It will be off the radar for some people.  But a lot of people will get it.\nThat story sounds like you.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  Then she said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnd IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like you to sing it with the Eagles.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  When youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re around somebody like that, you just dummy up and go with it.\nDon Henley was a big fan of the song and that line ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf memories were all I sang, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d rather drive a truck.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a couple of guys who donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to be packaged as an oldies sort of thing.  We still have new music to make.  We still have creative forces within us.\n\nWill you tour behind this album?\n\nAbsolutely.  These are the kinds of songs you play live.  The whole vibe of the recording is live.  When you have people around you who can handle those things, you want to keep playing with them.  If guys can only strum an open G chord, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not much fun.\n\nI hope you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait 36 years for the third Blue Ridge Rangers album.  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be 109 years old.\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll make it a scorcher.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Fogerty - electric guitar, acoustic guitar, lead vocal, back vocals, harmony vocals,\nBuddy Miller - electric guitar, acoustic guitar,\nKenny Aronoff - percussion, drums,\nGreg Leisz - steel guitar, lap steel, dobro, mandolin,\nJay Bellerose - drums,\nJason Mowery - fiddle, dobro, mandolin, back vocals,\nHerb Pedersen - back vocals, harmony vocals,\nJodie Kennedy - back vocals, harmony vocals,\nOren Waters - back vocals,\nChris Chaney - bass,\nDennis Crouch - bass,\nHunter Perrin - fingerstyle guitar, electric rhythm guitar.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
