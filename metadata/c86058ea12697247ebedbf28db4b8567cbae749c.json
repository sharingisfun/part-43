Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. \n\nMinorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. \n\nHow did the situation get so out of hand?\n\nOn this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. \n\nWhat opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? \n\nFault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.\n\nFLV: http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/faultlines/2010/11/2010111892118443641.html\n\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c86058ea12697247ebedbf28db4b8567cbae749c","amp;dn":"Fast+food%2C+Fat+profits++2010+++Aljazeera+Fault+Lines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c86058ea12697247ebedbf28db4b8567cbae749c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,96,88,234,18,105,114,71,235,237,191,40,219,75,133,103,203,174,116,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
