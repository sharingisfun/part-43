Hiss and noise removed.\n\nSince the Swedish version of the movie is a bit censored, there are a few moments where I had to use the English audio track.\n\nThe sound is resynced to work with the movie\n\nHere is a short summary of the movie:\n\nJim is working as an innkeeper, together with his friend, the mouse Gran. One day, a mysterious man visits the inn, leaving a map behind. The map shows an island with a treasure. So the duo sets off in their own little boat, trying to fulfil their dreams and leaving the inn far behind. But it seems more people knows of the map, as they cross paths with Captain Silver and his band of wild pirates. Jim, Gran and their new friend Kathy tries to beat them in the treasure hunt that ensues.\n\n\nDo check out my other torrent of the same kind (MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤sterkatten): &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5137993/Puss_in_boots_%28Swe_Sound%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5137993/Puss_in_boots_%28Swe_Sound%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHayao Miyazaki did the key animation and story for this film!\n\nCategories: Adventure, Action, Anime\nJapanese Title: Doubutsu Takarajima (ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¶ÃƒÂ£Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â®Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â¶)\nRip and Encode: Duckman\n\nTechnical information:\nVideo: XDiv 704x328, NTSC\nAudio: Swedish @ 128 kbps\nSubtitles: None\nRunning time: 1:18:43\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2c17e75ebddf8cf59abcfa423c0702e55f00ec0","amp;dn":"Animal+Treasure+Island+%28Swe+Sound%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2c17e75ebddf8cf59abcfa423c0702e55f00ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,193,126,117,235,221,248,207,89,171,207,164,35,192,112,46,85,240,14,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
