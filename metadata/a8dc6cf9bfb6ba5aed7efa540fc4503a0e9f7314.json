The album, which has been in the works for 4 years, is a much welcomed delight for anyone who heard their 2003 EP and wondered what could have been. I'm at a loss as to why this is the first torrent posted since the album was release in June; please do yourself a favour and give it a listen, share it, feel it, and as always if you like it, buy it.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8dc6cf9bfb6ba5aed7efa540fc4503a0e9f7314","amp;dn":"Reverie+Sound+Revue+2009+S%2FT+%5Bkillakittens%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8dc6cf9bfb6ba5aed7efa540fc4503a0e9f7314","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,220,108,249,191,182,186,90,237,126,250,84,15,196,80,58,14,159,115,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
