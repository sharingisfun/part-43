In        \n    reality, this often leaves many related files on the computer         \n    taking up valuable hard drive space. Amnesia performs a smart scan    \n    to determine all related files to be removed.                         \n                                                                          \n    Easily uninstall not just applications, but also Screen Savers,       \n    Dashboard Widgets, and Preference Panes. Amnesia will remove logs,    \n    caches, application support files, preferences, crash reports, and    \n    other application specific files. Take the frustration and time       \n    out of searching for all of these files manually. In addition,        \n    turn on a secure deletion option to prevent recovery of the           \n    removed files.                                                        \n                                                                          \n    Scared to accidently remove something you may need later? Amnesia     \n    comes with a built-in backup function which creates an archive of     \n    related files incase you wish to restore them at a later time. It     \n    will reinstall the pieces of the product exactly where they came      \n    from - even if you choose to restore to a different machine!          \n                                                                          \n    Another powerful feature Amnesia has to offer is the ability to       \n    create a list of Untouchables (in addition to the ones built-in).     \n    Untouchables are software products which Amnesia will warn you        \n    about incase a remove is attempted. This is handy incase a            \n    particular software product should be removed using a                 \n    manufacturer-provided uninstaller instead.                            \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                          \n                                                                   \n                                                      \n                                                          \n                                                \n                                                           \n                                                       \n                                                            \n                ..: iNSTALL/REGiSTER NOTES :..              \n                                                                     \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n    1. Make sure you're offline or use a firewall to block the           \n      application from connecting to the internet. This is the only      \n       way to gain access to offline activation.                         \n                                                                         \n    2. Select &quot;Activate Product&quot; from the main menu or when you're       \n       given the option upon running the program for the first time.     \n                                                                         \n    3. Select &quot;Activate this product now&quot; and enter anything into the    \n       buyer's email edit box.  This email is never used in display      \n       or for registering, so it can be anything. Press                  \n      Continue/Activate button.                                          \n                                                                         \n    4. Next it will give you a dialog to activate offline, press &quot;Yes&quot;   \n       button.  Now, for the buyer email enter in what you want to       \n       display as registered user.  Press &quot;Next Step&quot; button.            \n                                                                         \n    5. Copy the &quot;Challenge Code&quot; into our keygen to generate a valid     \n       &quot;Answer&quot;.  Press &quot;Next Step&quot; button.  Enter in &quot;Challenge         \n      Answer&quot;, press &quot;Activate&quot; and you're done.                         \n                                                                         \n    6. After this, the application can connect to internet and will      \n       stay registered as far as we can tell (maybe the protection       \n       will change in the future, who knows...).                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                                                                         \n                          ..: iMPORTANT NOTE :..                         \n                                                                         \n      Run CORE10k.EXE to verify this release, if CRC-check fails or      \n      even CORE10k.EXE is missing - you are probably using webshit!
