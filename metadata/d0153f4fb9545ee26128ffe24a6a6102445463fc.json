Young's body of work ranks second only to Bob Dylan in terms of depth, and he was able to sustain his critical reputation, as well as record sales, for a longer period of time than Dylan, partially because of his willfully perverse work ethic. From the beginning of his solo career in the late '60s through into the 21st century, he never stopped writing, recording, and performing; his official catalog only represented a portion of his work, since he kept countless tapes of unreleased songs in his vaults.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tReprise\n\n\nSilver &amp; Gold went through a number of incarnations before it was finally released in the spring of 2000. The endless delays raised hopes for the album, as did superstition -- dedicated Neil Young fans believed he was creatively reborn at the end of each decade. Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, Rust Never Sleeps, and Freedom added credence to this theory, but those records were knocked out quickly, appearing a year after their predecessors. In contrast, Silver &amp; Gold appeared four years after Broken Arrow. During those four years, all sorts of projects were in the works for Young, including a 1999 reunion with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. His three songs on their comeback Looking Forward were pleasant acoustic numbers that often seemed a little slight. It was easy to assume that Young was saving the real treasures for his solo record, but Silver &amp; Gold doesn't confirm that theory. Instead, it's a continuation of his Looking Forward contributions, performed with the warm, amiable ramble of Harvest Moon. A pleasant sound, to be sure, but not exactly what Young followers were expecting. They also may be a little dismayed to realize that two of its best songs, &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; and &quot;Razor Love,&quot; date from 1982 and 1987, respectively, suggesting that Neil may not be at the top of his game. Still, there are no truly bad songs here, although the light-hearted, light-headed reminiscence &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; treads close to the borderline. It's a low-key, charming, comfortable record, which is hardly a bad thing at all -- it just doesn't quite live up to the abnormally high expectations. Fortunately, those expectations fade upon repeated plays, and Silver &amp; Gold reveals itself as a nice Neil Young record. Nothing particularly special, but nice all the same.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Good To See You\n02.Silver &amp; Gold\n03.Daddy Went Walkin'\n04.Buffalo Springfield Again\n05.The Great Divide\n06.Horseshoe Man\n07.Red Sun\n08.Distant Camera\n09.Razor Love\n10.Without Rings\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0153f4fb9545ee26128ffe24a6a6102445463fc","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Silver+%26+Gold+%282000%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0153f4fb9545ee26128ffe24a6a6102445463fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,21,63,79,185,84,94,226,97,40,255,226,74,106,97,2,68,84,99,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
