The masterful James Cotton appears under a pseudonym, as he was under contract with another label, blowing the harp on three songs. On the remaining nine songs it is 21-year-old Paul Oscher playing fine, muscular harmonica parts.\n\nTrack List:\n\n1. What Is That She Got \n2. You Don't Have To Go \n3. Strange Woman \n4.
