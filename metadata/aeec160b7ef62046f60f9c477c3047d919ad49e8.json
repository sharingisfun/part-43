Lim\nTitle: Problems and solutions on Atomic, nuclear and particle physics\nNationality: USA\nGenre: Scientifico\nSize: 3.2 MB\nEstensione del file: pdf\nNumero di Pages: 727\n\n\nSolving problems in course work is an exercise of the mental facilities,\nand examination problems are usually chosen, or set similar to such problems.\nWorking out problems is thus an essential and important aspect of\nthe study of physics.\nThe problems have been carefully chosen from a total of 3100 problems,\ncollected from the China-U.S.A. Physics Examination and Application\nProgram, the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination on Experimental High\nEnergy Physics sponsored by Chao-Chong Ting, and the graduate qualifying\nexaminations of seven world-renowned American universities: Columbia\nUniversity, the University of California at Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology, the University of Wisconsin, the University of Chicago,\nPrinceton University, and the State University of New York at Buffalo.\nThis volume on Atomic, Nuclear and Particle Physics which contains\n483 problems is divided into four parts: Atomic and Molecular Physics\n(142), Nuclear Physics (120), Particle Physics (90), Experimental Methods\nand Miscellaneous topics (131).\nThis volume was the result of the collective efforts of forty physicists\ninvolved in working out and checking of the solutions, notably Ren Yong,\nQian Jian-ming, Chen Tao, Cui Ning-zhuo, Mo Hai-ding, Gong Zhu-fang\nand Yang Bao-zhong.\n\n\n Visit this link: http://img512.Imageshack.us/img512/6281/limuno.th.jpg\n\n Visit this link: http://img35.Imageshack.us/img35/5629/limdue.th.jpg\n Visit this link: http://img190.Imageshack.us/img190/6126/limquattro.th.jpg Visit this link: http://img197.Imageshack.us/img197/9154/limtre.th.jpg\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[font=Comic Sans MS]NOTE[/font]\n30KB/s 7/7 24/24 \n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeec160b7ef62046f60f9c477c3047d919ad49e8","amp;dn":"8_Lim_Problems+and+solutions+on+Atomic%2C+nuclear+and+particle+phy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeec160b7ef62046f60f9c477c3047d919ad49e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,236,22,11,126,246,32,70,246,15,156,71,124,48,71,217,25,173,73,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
