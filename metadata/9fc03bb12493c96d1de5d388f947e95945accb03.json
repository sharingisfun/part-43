Innocent When You Dream (78)\n\n\nAll the voices in Tom Waits' head come out on this CD: the growler (of course), the crooner, the preacher, the screecher, and the Vegas cheese ball. The instrumentation is equally eclectic. (Yep, that's Waits himself playing the &quot;rooster&quot; on the album's best song, &quot;I'll Be Gone.&quot;) More memorable moments: &quot;Innocent When You Dream&quot; (both times), the vocal howling at the end of &quot;Blow Wind Blow,&quot; and the lovely coughing fit after &quot;I'll Take New York.&quot; Frank's Wild Years is the musical remains of a theatrical collaboration between Waits and Kathleen Brennan, originally staged in 1986. It contains nuggets of important practical advice, sure--&quot;never drive a car when you're dead&quot; (from &quot;Telephone Call from Istanbul&quot;)--but mostly these songs are fantasy freaks. Frank's is big-time dreamer. It's a dreamy album. Sweet dreams.\nDan Leone\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc03bb12493c96d1de5d388f947e95945accb03","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+-+Frank%5C%27s+Wild+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc03bb12493c96d1de5d388f947e95945accb03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,192,59,177,36,147,201,109,29,229,211,136,249,71,233,89,69,172,203,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
