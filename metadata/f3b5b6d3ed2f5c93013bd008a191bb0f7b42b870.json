The song was released on May 19, 2009, as the album's fifth single in the United States. The remix, featuring hip hop artist Kanye West, is included on the Above and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© - Video Collection &amp; Dance Mixes CD/DVD.\n\nKnowles co-directed the video for &quot;Ego&quot; with her choreographer of twelve years, Frank Gatson Jr. Gatson has been Knowles' creative director for several of her videos, such as &quot;Suga Mama&quot;, &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;, and &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot;, as well as her last three world tours, including the I AmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Tour. Knowles let Gatson direct the video for &quot;Ego&quot; after he introduced her to a new choreographer, Sheryl Murakami.\n\n&quot;My goal for [the] video is simplicity&quot;, Knowles tells Entertainment Weekly. &quot;In 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', I saw this old tape of Bob Fosse's wife, and I used that as inspiration. I thought in this world, with all the technology and everything that's going on, to strip everything downÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½great idea. So I kind of did the same thing, but glossy and black, for 'Ego'&quot;. A &quot;bootlegged&quot; version of the music video, featuring Sheryl Murakami performing the choreography, was leaked ontoin early March 2009.\n\nThe video premiered on Beyonce's official website on May 21, 2009. The video, like the ones for If I Were A Boy, Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It), and Diva was shot in black and white. The video consists of BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in a silver leotard and two other women dressed similarly doing the same choreography as her, which has reminiscence of the video of Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It). Later in the video she is sitting in a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background, in a black suit with the two dancers still dancing in unison around her, there are a few shots of her in the chair to the back of the camera with the dancers also with their backs to the camera. Later BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© gets up from the chair and dances with the dancers around the chair this scene ends as she and the dancers walk to the left of the camera and walk into the next scene. In this scene she is still with the tiled background and she and her dancers are holding poles with which they dance with. Also, there are, during the pole scene some shots of her on her own singing in the chair from the second scene. In the next scene, with the same tiled background, BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is leaning against the wall during the Bridge of the song and her dancers spin in heels around her and afterwards they all continue to dance against the wall. The very last scene shows BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in the chair, without the black jacket and dancing to herself while the song ends. This is the first video from I Am... Sasha Fierce for her to have curly afro hair, similar to the one in Work It Out. It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce side of her album where she does not don her robo-glove as in &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; and &quot;Diva&quot;. In the premiered version of the music video, the word &quot;bitch&quot; is muted out when BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© states &quot;I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch!&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3b5b6d3ed2f5c93013bd008a191bb0f7b42b870","amp;dn":"Beyonce+-+Ego","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3b5b6d3ed2f5c93013bd008a191bb0f7b42b870","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,181,182,211,237,47,92,147,1,59,208,8,161,145,187,15,123,66,184,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
