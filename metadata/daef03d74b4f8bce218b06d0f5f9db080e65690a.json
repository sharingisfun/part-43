The most notorious of them all is the axe gang, lead by the insane Brother Sum. A slum called Pig Sty Alley is the only area safe from the Axes because the people there are so poor. Soon, wannabe gangster Sing and his pal Bone attempt to extort money out of a barber and fail, drawing the real Axe Gang to Pig Sty. However, it turns out that there are several kung fu masters living in the slum, and soon the two sides are enemies. As the plot thickens, Sing must decide- should he become a mobster, or save the day?\n\nscreens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daef03d74b4f8bce218b06d0f5f9db080e65690a","amp;dn":"Kung+Fu+Hustle.2004.BrRip.720p.HINDI+DUB%7E%28-FPR-%29-%7Bdeff%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daef03d74b4f8bce218b06d0f5f9db080e65690a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,239,3,215,75,79,139,206,33,139,6,208,245,249,219,8,14,101,105,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
