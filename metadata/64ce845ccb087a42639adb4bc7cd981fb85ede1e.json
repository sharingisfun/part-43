Live tapes of Big Brother in its prime with Joplin fronting the band are an extremely rare commodity, rendering The Lost Tapes a truly historic discovery.This two-CD set from Airline Records contains no less than 12 stunning tracksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the entire first disc--that have never been released before in any form, along with a second disc of equally thrilling live material that sees its first legitimate release on this package.Consisting of guitarists Sam Andrew and James Gurley, bassist Peter Albin, drummer David Getz, and the mighty Janis as their mind-blowing lead singer, Big BrotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sets were liable to proceed in any number of contrasting directions. Over the course of the concert that comprises the first disc, Janis belts her own blues-soaked ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWomen Is LosersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as well as the subtly dynamic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBye Bye Baby,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ songs soon to be eminently familiar via the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s studio versions. There was also room on their set list that evening to investigate Tommy TuckerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tough shuffle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHi-Heel Sneakers,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the riveting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh My Soul,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and an amazing 11-minute rendition of the timeless spiritual ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmazing Grace.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nEven diehard Big Brother fans well acquainted with the material on the second disc have never encountered it in such pristine condition, both discs benefitting from 24-bit mastering. Highlights on the second CD include rousing treatments of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLet The Good Times Roll,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Know You Rider,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoaninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ At Midnight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHey Baby,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the Albin-penned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCoo Coo.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Also aboard are the Port Arthur, Texas-born JoplinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pulverizing renderings of two songs forever associated with her brief but indelible musical legacy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDown On MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Big Mama ThorntonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBall And Chain.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This deluxe collection features liner notes by Big Brother members Sam Andrew and David Getz; their warm, vivid reminiscences adding to the immense appeal of the most extensive authorized domestic release currently available by the band. Big Brother was already a powerhouse despite being together as a unit a relatively short time, and this is where it all began for Janis. With The Lost Tapes, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re sitting front row as they prepare to meet stardom head on.\n\nDate Added: 06/13/2008 by Tim Murphy \n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1. Bye Bye Baby\n2.
