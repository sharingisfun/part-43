In the early '50s, he scored a series of major hits that made him one of the most popular recording artists of the time. In the early '60s, he mounted a comeback as more of an adult-album seller. And from the mid-'80s on, he achieved renewed popularity with generations of listeners who hadn't been born when he first appeared. This, however, defines Bennett more in terms of marketing than music. He himself probably would say that, in each phase of his career, he has remained largely constant to his goals of singing the best available songs the best way he knows how. Popular taste may have caused his level of recognition to increase or decrease, but he continued to sing popular standards in a warm, husky tenor, varying his timing and phrasing with a jazz fan's sense of spontaneity to bring out the melodies and lyrics of the songs effectively. By the start of the 21st century, Bennett seemed like the last of a breed, but he remained as popular as ever.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\t\t\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Second Time Around\n02.I Wanna Be Around\n03.I Left My Heart In San Francisco\n04.For Once In My Life\n05.(Where Do I Begin) Love Story\n06.A Taste Of Honey\n07.Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)\n08.It Had To Be You\n09.The Shadow Of Your Smile\n10.What A Wonderful World\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130fc4b217850fabf6247e37223b53a87a68fd97","amp;dn":"Tony+Bennett+-+My+Best+To+You+%282003%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130fc4b217850fabf6247e37223b53a87a68fd97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,15,196,178,23,133,15,171,246,36,126,55,34,59,83,168,122,104,253,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
