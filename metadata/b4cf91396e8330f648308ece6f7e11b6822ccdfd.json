Put Eletrik4a's video to Imagine's line audio, thanx to both. Scrapped this project twice as new sources became available, but this is the best to date by far. First 30 minutes split into 15 second chunks and synced separately, next 30 minutes split into 5 minute chunks and synced, last 30 minutes split into 2 1/2 minute chunks and synced separately, so this is fully synced. Video is mint and audio is very nice as well.
