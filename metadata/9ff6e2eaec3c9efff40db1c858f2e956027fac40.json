With such soloists as tenor saxophonist John Coltrane and trumpeter Donald Byrd, plus steady support provided by bassist George Joyner and drummer Art Taylor, Garland gets to stretch out on the title cut and four jazz originals, including &quot;Birk's Works&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah.&quot;  Coltrane is in excellent form, playing several stunning sheets of sound solos. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nCombined with the companion CD &quot;All Morning Long&quot;, and the third CD &quot;High Pressure&quot;, this may well be the peak of the 'straight-ahead' jazz genre mountain.  The chemistry is perfect.  John Coltrane is at his best and Donald Byrd soars.  Red and drummer Art Taylor are nearly telepathic at times on this session (check out Dizzy Gillespie's 'Woody'n You').  In the end, it is Red Garland's flawless blues, ballads, block chording, and sense of time that puts this session over the top.  November and December, 1957.
