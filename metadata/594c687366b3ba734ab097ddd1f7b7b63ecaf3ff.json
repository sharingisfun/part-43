By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. \n\n\nWinRAR supports all popular compression formats (RAR, ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, ACE, TAR, GZip, UUE, ISO, BZIP2, Z and 7-Zip).\n\n\nWinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well.\n\n\nWinRAR allows you to split archives into separate volumes easily, making it possible to save them on several disks for example.\n\n\nWinRAR is also ideal, if you are sending data through the web. Its 128 bit password encryption and its authenticated signature technology will give you the peace of mind you have been looking for.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594c687366b3ba734ab097ddd1f7b7b63ecaf3ff","amp;dn":"%5B32%2664-bit%5D+WinRAR+4.0+Beta+5+%2B+Key+%5BENG%5D+%5BQUBiCA%5D+TESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594c687366b3ba734ab097ddd1f7b7b63ecaf3ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,76,104,115,102,179,186,115,74,176,151,221,209,247,183,182,62,202,243,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
