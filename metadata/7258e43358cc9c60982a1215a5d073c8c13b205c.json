It was released in the United States on November 10, 2009. The album debuted at #4 on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and at #57 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it has since peaked at #27. The album received generally favorable reviews.\n\n&quot;Give It to Me Right&quot; is the debut single from The Bridge. The song peaked at number 57 on the U.S. Billboard  Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\n&quot;It Kills Me&quot; was Fiona's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, charting at #43. The single was being the second from that album in the U.S. and charted at #1 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart. It was released in Canada as the third single from the album and will be released as the third single in the UK on 14 June, 2010.\n\n&quot;Bang Bang&quot; was released in the UK and Canada as the second single for top 40 and hot adult contemporary radio stations.\n\n&quot;Monday Morning&quot; has already charted in Switzerland and Poland at number 1 and in Austria at number 5. It was released as the third U.S. single (however, &quot;Bang Bang&quot; was released as the second Canadian single for Canadian top 40 &amp; hot AC play), but due to &quot;Priceless&quot; not being released in Canada, &quot;Monday Morning&quot; will serve as the fifth single in Canada due to hot adult contemporary radio station CKZZ-FM (Virgin Radio 953) in Vancouver having the song on its playlist.\n\n&quot;Ay Yo&quot; was released as fourth single released from The Bridge, according to Fiona's website and Twitter. The music video premiered on April 12, 2010.\n\n&quot;Priceless&quot; will be the fifth U.S. single due to airplay on urban adult contemporary stations. Due to &quot;Priceless&quot; not being released in Canada, &quot;Monday Morning&quot; will be serviced to Canadian stations as the fifth single, even though &quot;Monday Morning&quot; was released as the third American single.\n\nThe Bridge has received generally positive reviews from music critics. Edwin McFee of Hot Press called the album &quot;an intelligent homage to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s Motown, sampling soul classics while putting her own unique stamp on things&quot;. Allmusic's Matthew Chisling gave it 3Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ out of 5 stars and wrote that &quot;where it does go, it goes masterfully&quot;, concerning its sound. Despite noting a weakness in the album's cohesiveness, Mark Edward Nero of About.com  wrote favorably of the album's production and commended Fiona for her vocal ability. &quot;It Kills Me&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7258e43358cc9c60982a1215a5d073c8c13b205c","amp;dn":"Melanie+Fiona+-+Ay+Yo++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7258e43358cc9c60982a1215a5d073c8c13b205c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,88,228,51,88,204,156,96,152,42,18,21,165,208,115,200,193,59,32,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
