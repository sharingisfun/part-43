Originally formed in 1988 as a roots rock outfit with slight elements of country and punk, the group's first incarnation consisted of four college students from Louisiana State University: Kevin Griffin (vocals, guitar), Joel Rundell (guitar), Tom Drummond (bass), and Cary Bonnecaze (drums). The band's early performances were expectedly held at college bars and fraternity houses, and their debut cassette-tape recording, 1990's Surprise, received positive press and comparisons to such alt-punk stalwarts as the Replacements and Dinosaur Jr. Despite these accolades, Better Than Ezra's future was thrust into doubt when Rundell committed suicide on August 8, 1990.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tElektra\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.In The Blood\n02.Good\n03.Southern GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rl\n04.The Killer Inside\n05.Rosealia\n06.Cry In The Sun\n07.Teenager\n08.(Untitled Track)\n09.Summerhouse\n10.Porcelain\n11.Heaven\n12.This Time Of Year\n13.Coyote\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ee85d52c5d9d7109e6bf8f6460faa5e727bc07","amp;dn":"Better+Than+Ezra+-+Deluxe+%281995%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ee85d52c5d9d7109e6bf8f6460faa5e727bc07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,238,133,213,44,93,157,113,9,230,191,143,100,96,250,165,231,39,188,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
