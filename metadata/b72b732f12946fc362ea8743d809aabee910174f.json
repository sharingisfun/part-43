They have released three studio albums, the most recent and most successful of which is 2010's Grammy nominated Infinite Arms. The band's line up, which included Mat Brooke for their debut album, has undergone several changes, although the current members, Bridwell, Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey, Bill Reynolds, and Creighton Barrett have all been with the band for several years. Vocalist Bridwell has been likened to Jim James of My Morning Jacket, early Neil Young, and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Horses&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Horses&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seattle based rock band, Band of Horses, have released a five-track digital EP and it is now available via iTunes.\n\nThe American rock band released an EP for their live P3 Sessions in Oslo, Norway.
