You choose from six playable characters with no discernible difference and fight tooth and nail through legions of baddies, racking up a body count to rival John Rambo's.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple: move with the D-pad, shoot with one button, and jump with another. You can use the touch-screen to view your map, although if you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“t figure out where to go, odds are youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“re having this review read to you while you struggle with your juice box.\n\nI find that, in writing this, any review of Metal Slug 7 will be a retrospective of the series as a whole because if youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve played one Metal Slug, youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve played them all. But if you felt the first game needed to be about an hour longer and you really needed more character choice than ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlayer1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPlayer2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, then perhaps Metal Slug 7 is the game youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve been waiting for in between Ritalin doses.\n\nThe only significant additions are the new vehicles called &quot;slugs&quot; - a tank, a plane, a robot on a radio flier wagon, the trouble bubble from GI Joe, a bipedal shopping cart with guns, and a giant robot - but even they (except for that last one) are kind of boring. Metal Slug is also one of those ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealisticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shooters where you canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t take a bullet to the chest without flinching and where you can get run down by a tank and come out smelling like roses.\n\nWhile in one of these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, left and right control movement, and up and down control your aim. But as simple as this sounds, this can be frustrating to the point of throwing your DS out the nearest window. You will also be attacked from both sides, which wonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t aid in the grounding of any airborne DSs. This kind of design would be okay if it was for an arcade game, but itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s not, so thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s no need to bilk players for quarters. Fortunately, you have the option to forego the vehicles in most cases, and in the parts where you are required to use one, itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s not so bad. In fact, one of them has you piloting the aforementioned giant robot and going toe to toe with a similarly sized fellow.\n\n\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................\nABOUT THE GAME FOLDER\n\n    FILE NAME : METAL SLUG\n    FILE FORMAT : WINRAR\n    FILE SIZE : 30 MB\n    PLAYING AGE : 13+\n\n\n===================================================================================================================================\n\nHOW TO OPEN\n\n    Extract file with help of winrar\n    PLAY It\n    Enjoy It\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIf Any Problem So Please Write Comment ..
