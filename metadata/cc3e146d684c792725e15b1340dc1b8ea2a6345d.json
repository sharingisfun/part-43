It shows conditions during the Holocaust, and then footage of the creation of Israel through the end of the 6-day war in 1967. It isn't exactly comprehensive, but the footgae is rare and worthwhile for history buffs. The packaging reads:\n\nChronicling the events surrounding the birth of the state of Israel in 1948, this documentary also includes the horrific events in Europe that sparked the nation's founding and the overwhelming regional hostility that it confronted. Director Larry Frisch explores the military prowess and innovative solutions to environmental and other challenges that have helped Israel flourish. Actor Steven Hill narrates.\n\nCast:Steven Hill \n\nDirector:Larry Frisch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3e146d684c792725e15b1340dc1b8ea2a6345d","amp;dn":"Miracle+of+Survival+-+1970+Documentary+on+Israel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3e146d684c792725e15b1340dc1b8ea2a6345d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,62,20,109,104,76,121,39,37,225,91,19,64,220,27,142,162,166,52,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
