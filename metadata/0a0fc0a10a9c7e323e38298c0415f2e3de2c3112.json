Today, human beings are turning on the same life-saving\nphysical reaction to cope with 30-year mortgages, $4 a gallon\ngasoline, final exams, difficult bosses and even traffic jams\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we can't seem to turn it off. So, we're constantly marinating\nin corrosive hormones triggered by the stress response. Now,\nscientists are showing just how measurable ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and dangerous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nprolonged exposure to stress can be. Stanford University\nneurobiologist, MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant recipient, and renowned\nauthor Robert Sapolsky reveals new answers to why and how chronic\nstress is threatening our lives in Killer Stress, a National\nGeographic Special. The hour-long co-production of National\nGeographic Television and Stanford University was produced\nexclusively for public television. In this revelatory film,\ndiscoveries occur in an extraordinary range of places, from\nbaboon troops on the plains of East Africa to the office cubes\nof government bureaucrats in London to neuroscience labs at the\nnation's leading research universities. Groundbreaking research\nreveals surprising facts about the impact of stress on our bodies\n: how it can shrink our brains, add fat to our bellies and even\nunravel our chromosomes. Understanding how stress works can\nhelp us figure out ways to combat it and mitigate negative impacts\non our health. For over three decades, Robert Sapolsky has been\nworking to advance our understanding of stress ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in particular\nhow our social standing (our place in various hierarchies) can\nmake us more or less susceptible to the damaging effects of stress.\nThroughout the film, he weaves the grim realities of the impact of\nchronic stress with his wry observations about 21st century life.\n&quot;The reality is I am unbelievably stressed and Type A and poorly\ncoping,&quot; says Sapolsky. &quot;Why else would I study this stuff 80\nhours a week? No doubt everything I advise is going to lose all\nits credibility if I keel over dead from a heart attack in my early\n50s. I'm not good at dealing with stress. But one thing that works\nto my advantage is I love my work. I love every aspect of it.&quot;\n\nThe film is based partly on Sapolsky's best-selling book Why Zebras\nDon't Get Ulcers: Stress, Disease and Coping. In addition to his\nprofessorship at Stanford, Sapolsky is a research associate with\nthe Institute of Primate Research at the National Museum of Kenya.\nHe is also the author of Monkeyluv, A Primate's Memoir and The\nTrouble with Testosterone, a Los Angeles Times Book Award finalist.\nScientists from the University of North Carolina, the University of\nLondon, Rockefeller University and the University of California,\nSan Francisco share their compelling insights into how stress\nimpacts the body, giving stress a new relevance and urgency\nto our increasingly complex lives.\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x480 (16:9) [Video]\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [Audio]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a0fc0a10a9c7e323e38298c0415f2e3de2c3112","amp;dn":"Stress%3A+Portrait+of+a+Killer+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a0fc0a10a9c7e323e38298c0415f2e3de2c3112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,15,192,161,10,156,126,50,62,56,41,140,4,21,242,227,222,44,49,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
