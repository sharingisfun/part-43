It was the beginning of the end of     \n    three decades of treason, rebellion and dynastic         \n    warfare.                                                  \n                                                               \n    Against huge odds, Henry Tudor won the day to take the    \n    English Crown. It was a turning point in English         \n    history, the end of the Middle Ages and the savage        \n    beginnings of the country we recognise today.              \n                                                              \n    For five years, a team of archaeologists have been       \n    combing this blood-stained ground. What these             \n    archaeologists have found is changing the entire           \n    understanding, not just of this iconic battle, but the    \n    very nature of warfare at this time.                     \n                                                              \n    Experts now believe that the battle was not only fought    \n    in an entirely different place from the 'official' site   \n    but that gunpowder weapons, including large cannon,      \n    were used in far larger numbers than previously thought   \n                                                               \n                                                              \n    In order to test these theories the team build and fire  \n    replica cannons and cannon balls, and deploy some of      \n    the most sophisticated cameras in the world to examine     \n    the grisly remains of soldiers killed in the Wars.        \n                                                             \n    The conclusions they draw radically change the view of    \n    medieval warfare being ruled by knights in shining         \n    armour.                                                   \n                                                             \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9c27da5a6b27fdd40254dc3dcbedc596a77eb27","amp;dn":"Wars.of.the.Roses-A.Time.Team.Special.HDTV.XviD-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9c27da5a6b27fdd40254dc3dcbedc596a77eb27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,194,125,165,166,178,127,221,64,37,77,195,220,190,220,89,106,119,235,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
