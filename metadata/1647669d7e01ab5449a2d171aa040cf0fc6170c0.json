It does a fairly good job in providing a brief history, but the main strength of the collection simply comes from the music.  Featuring cuts from Lightnin' Hopkins, Howlin' Wolf, B. B.  King, Slim Harpo, Junior Parker, Elmore James, Albert Collins, and many, many others, it's a quick and effective way to sample a variety of different blues styles.  For neophytes, Essential Blues does offer a splendid introduction to the genre. \n\nThe House of Blues label has done it again with another incredible collection of blues essentials.  From classics must-haves by Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, and John Lee Hooker to more recent recordings by Taj Mahal and Luther Allison, this collection is calling to you.\nAlso have to mention that the album art and liner notes are beautifully designed and well-written.\n\nOnly reason not to give it a full five stars is too many tracks pulled from other HOB discs, but if you don't have them all yet, you won't mind. ~ A Customer, Amazon \n\nVA House of Blues: Essential Blues V3 Dsk 1 of 2\n01  You Can't Always Get What You Want - Luther Allison\n02  Got My Mojo Working - Muddy Waters\n03  You Fired Yourself - Otis Rush\n04  Chicago Bound - Jimmy Rogers\n05  Up And Down World - Johnny Adams\n06  I Need You So Bad - Magic Sam\n07  Jinz Blues - Corey Harris\n08  Farther Up The Road - Bobby Bland\n09  I Don't Know - Sonny Boy Williamson\n10  Call It Stormy Monday (But Tuesday Is Just As Bad) - T-Bone Walker\n11  My Babe - Little Walter\n12  (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction - Junior Wells\n13  I'm In The Mood - John Lee Hooker\n14  Shake 'Em On Down - R.
