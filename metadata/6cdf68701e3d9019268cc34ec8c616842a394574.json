This installer already contains the 1.1 update and is pre-cracked, so you just need to install the game and play.\n\nInstallation:\n -Mount the ISO image to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD and pop-in the disc\n -In the launcher, select Install / Installieren (the launcher likes to start \n in german)\n -Install the game like you would with any program\n -Start the game with the shortcut on your desktop/start menu (unless you didn't\n install shortcuts)\n -Have fun!\n\nJust like with my Resident Evil collection, I included the source of the installer, so that everyone can check it out.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!\n\n\nNote: I have a dual monitor setup and when I started the game under Win7 x64, the screen was completely blank. This was easily solved by temporarily disabling the second monitor by pressing WinKey + P","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cdf68701e3d9019268cc34ec8c616842a394574","amp;dn":"FAHRENHEIT.v1.1.Repack-TURION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cdf68701e3d9019268cc34ec8c616842a394574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,223,104,112,30,61,144,25,38,140,195,78,200,198,22,132,42,57,69,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
