The US release of the album was pulled from the stores because of a large number of inaccuracies in the credits and liner notes. This album was also included as the first disc of the compilation The Platinum Collection (2005). There are three uncredited rarities included on the album. They are 'John, I'm Only Dancing' (Sax Version) - recorded during the sessions for the 'Aladdin Sane' album, 'The Prettiest Star' (Single Version), - the original 1970 single release that features Marc Bolan on lead guitar and 'All The Young Dudes' (Studio Version) which is the original Bowie studio version from 1973\n\nAmazon.com - UK issue of 20 track 'Best Of' which was originally released in the U.S. in 1997 for a limited time. Includes the classics you'd expect, 'The Jean Genie', 'Space Oddity', 'Starman', 'Drive In Saturday', 'Ziggy Stardust', 'Suffragette City', 'Changes', 'Sorrow', 'The Man Who Sold the World' and relative obscurities like the B-side 'Velvet Goldmine', Bowie's version of 'All the Young Dudes' and alternate takes of 'John, I'm Only Dancing' and 'The Prettiest Star'.
