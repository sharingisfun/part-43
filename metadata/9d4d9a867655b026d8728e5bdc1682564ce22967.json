Mainly influenced by punk and heavy metal acts such as The Stooges, early era Guns N' Roses, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e, Iron Maiden, the Ramones, Girlschool, Joan Jett and Neil Young, they had crafted their own unique, sleazy style of rock 'n' roll, once being described as &quot;a derailed train hitting a Baptist Church&quot;. The founding members were vocalist/bassist Ethan Deth, who had previously been in a hardcore band called Jakarta, guitarist/bassist Anthony Useless, a.k.a. Cobra, and lead guitarist Chad &quot;Dallas&quot; MacKinnon.\n\nThe original members of the group were childhood friends who learned their instruments by practicing old Guns 'N Roses, The Stooges and MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e songs. A band member reportedly said that the name came from miserable high school experiences, saying, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbeat up the jocks and kill the cheerleadersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. They started off playing shows in Toronto but were soon banned from clubs for their on and off stage antics, so they started playing shows in L.A. [1]\n\nAfter some 8000 demo CDs were sold, a German record label licensed one of their unmixed/unmastered recordings and released it as 7 track LP titled Gutter Days which was rereleased on 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vinyl in 2003. One reviewer called it &quot;the greatest punk n' roll recording ever made... completely redefined excellence in that genre... I am shaken...&quot; (House of Smut). Ky Anto, lead guitarist for Robin Black once called them &quot;The sound of desperation&quot;... Nikki Sixx of MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e called them the &quot;best new band&quot; in his online journal. SPIN Magazine journalists wrote how they were &quot;blown away&quot; about their live show, and Alternative Press has called them a &quot;band to watch.&quot; Rock legend Lemmy from MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead invited them to open their UK tour [2] and talked about them on SuicideGirls.com and in Playboy, declaring KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ll CheerleadÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«r as the &quot;greatest rock n' roll band since Guns N' Roses.&quot;\n\nTheir music has been described as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe greatest fusion of Stooges/Guns fuck rock anyone has ever spewedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, as well as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtaking the energy of early Motorhead while grinding it together with the energy of bands like The Ramones or The StoogesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Critics have also stated that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpre-punk rockers The Stooges, glam stalwarts Motley Crue, and straight-up scumbags Guns N' Roses have their fingerprints all over Kill Cheerleader's soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Ethan Deth has pointed out that &quot;we have our punk and metal songs but we also have a strong Neil Young influence, which we don't ignoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nAfter traveling to the U.S west coast and playing a number of high-profile shows in Los Angeles the band gained a new following for their destructive and fresh take on dirty punk-metal. Their debut album All Hail was released in 2004 through Spinerazor Records.\n\nThe band broke up in 2006 on the eve of a major record deal, due to drug addicted members. 1 key member is currently in jail and this destroys any hope of a reunion.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nI have available the &quot;All Hail&quot; album in full as well as the &quot;Go&quot; EP. I plan to post the &quot;Gutter Days&quot; EP after I post this one... I cannot include it in this torrent, since their band name was Cheerleader 666 at the time. \n\nDownload, enjoy, and spread the word!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d4d9a867655b026d8728e5bdc1682564ce22967","amp;dn":"Kill+Cheerleader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d4d9a867655b026d8728e5bdc1682564ce22967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,77,154,134,118,85,176,38,216,114,142,91,220,22,130,86,76,226,41,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
