These duplicates not only spoil a nice hierarchical structure of your folders but also take a lot of space.\n\nConstant Synchronizing Madness\n\nAll of us are afraid of losing our digital files. Therefore we make many backup copies using external hard disks, flash cards and network volumes. When files from different backups are mixed on your Mac to build their logical structure is practically impossible. You see several equal quarterly reports in one place then some of them elsewhere. Do they multiply?\n\nFuzzy Kittens: We All Do It\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDownloadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ folder usually contains hundreds of unsorted files from the Internet. Applications, images, music, movies and documents are saved now and again without checking if they are already on your computer. You canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop saving photos of fuzzy kittens repeatedly.\n\nNo Need To Worry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Only Exact File Copies Will Be Reported\n\nThere are many applications which find duplicates using such indirect signs as similar filenames, equal creation dates and so on. In this case the probability of a false detection of duplicates among different files is very high and the consequences can be terrible. Singlemizer compares the content of files only therefore you can be sure that all files indicated in the report are absolutely identical.\n\nNon-Destructive Removal\n\nMany people don't trust to third-party applications making manipulations with their file systems. People consider these applications can damage data. Singlemizer will dispel your fears! During scanning Singlemizer only reads not changing anything. Also Singlemizer doesn't ever delete userÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s files: all duplicates marked by you are moved to Trash with all absolute paths remaining saved. In other words you can always restore those files which you deleted accidentally.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5f1f89328e145702aeb3a7f48d52e6cbe41c0c","amp;dn":"Singlemizer+v2.0.4+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5f1f89328e145702aeb3a7f48d52e6cbe41c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,95,31,137,50,142,20,87,2,174,179,167,244,141,82,230,203,228,28,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
