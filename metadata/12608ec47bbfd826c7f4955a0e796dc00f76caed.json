SyncBackPro can also backup to an ISO image file which can be mounted as a virtual drive (using 3rd party software). SyncBackPro also performs automatic disk spanning, i.e. if your files do not fit onto the CD/DVD then it will split the files and continue onto another CD/DVD.\nChoose SyncBackSE \t\n\nBackup To or Restore From an Email Server\nSyncBackPro allows the user to backup or synchronize their files with an email server whether SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 (not to be confused with synchronizing emails). This is similar to backing up via FTP, however the backup is made via an email server e.g. Gmail, Yahoo!, etc. SyncBackPro provides advanced customization of the settings that allow the user to define SMTP and POP3/IMAP4 server connection details like &quot;Must use SSL/TLS connection&quot;, &quot;Direct SSL/TLS connection&quot;, and includes the ability to create a custom email body instead of using the default.\nChoose SyncBackSE \tScripting Support\nSyncBackPro allows the user to configure the program and profiles using their own scripts. Scripts are distinct from the core code of the application, which is written in a different language. Scripting is a way in which the functionality of SyncBackPro can be changed or extended. A script is a set of instructions and is similar to the macro support in Microsoft Office, and Java Script in web pages. SyncBackPro can use scripts written in any scripting language (supported by the Windows Scripting Host) that is installed on the computer. SyncBackPro Scripts.\nChoose SyncBackSE \tSFTP Support\nSFTP, or secure FTP, is a program that uses SSH to transfer files. Unlike standard FTP, it encrypts both commands and data, preventing passwords and sensitive information from being transmitted transparently over a network. Functionally similar to FTP, SFTP uses a different protocol, it is not possible to use a standard FTP client to talk to an SFTP server, nor is it possible to connect to an FTP server with a client that supports only SFTP.\nChoose SyncBackSE \tProcesses an Unlimited Number of Files\nInstead of storing the information in RAM (memory), SyncBackPro uses a database to store details of the files it is copying. This means an unlimited number of files and folders can be processed. SyncBackPro uses RAM for performance but will automatically and seamlessly switch to a database if memory is running low or the number of files reaches a threshold. Using a database is significantly faster when the number of files is in the hundreds of thousands.\nChoose SyncBackSE \tBZip2 Compression\nEnjoy a higher compression rate than Zip making FTP and email backups faster, and lessening the load on network backups. BZip2 typically compresses files up to 15% more, is around twice as fast at compression, and six times faster at decompression. Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors.\nChoose SyncBackSE \t\n\nAutomatic Drive Failure Detection\nSelf-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, or &quot;S.M.A.R.T.&quot;, is a monitoring system for computer hard disks to detect and report on various indicators of reliability, in the hope of anticipating failures. Mechanical failures, which are usually predictable failures, account for 60 percent of drive failure. The purpose of S.M.A.R.T. is to warn a user or system administrator of impending drive failure while time remains to take preventative action - such as copying the data to a replacement device.\n\n\nSyncBackPro - Tried and Trusted\n\nSyncBackPro delivers the tried and tested functionality of a program now in version 5 that has received numerous accolades and awards for being the very best backup and synchronization software on the market.\n\n\t\n\nBackup\nProtect your data\nBackup all your important files anytime with a single click, &amp; use the scheduler to automate your backups.\n\n\t\n\nRestore\nRecover your lost files easily\nWhen disaster strikes, click a single button to restore.
