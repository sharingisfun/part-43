After 3 critically acclaimed volumes Will Holland is back with the fourth instalment, already crowned Album Of The Month by the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest dance music publication, Mixmag ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ making it an impressive four in a row for this essential release series and a true testament to the quality of Enhanced.\n\n2010 was without question a gala year for Enhanced, with Volume Three providing the launch pad for what was to come, and Volume Four looks to mirror that with 29 stand out tracks, of which 26 are unreleased and all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as always are from EnhancedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s group of labels. Primarily based on the forthcoming releases of Enhanced Recordings and Enhanced Progressive, Will has carefully selected a handful of standout productions from the label groups ever expanding imprints, making this an even more mouth watering prospect.\n\n[img]http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/4654/enhvol4cover300pix.jpg[/img]\n\nDisc One focuses on the progressive tip, and opens with fresh material from the likes of Enhanced ProgressiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading lights Arty, Audien and JPL, along with fresh recruits Schodt and Willem de Roo. As the disc progresses to a techier territory, future hits and remixes from Estiva, Tritonal, LTN, Lang &amp; Yep and Adam Nickey under his new Nickey guise turn up the heat to boiling point, whilst Mat Zo, Alexander Popov and Maor Levi deliver some of the best remixes youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re likely to hear all year.\n\nOpening the second disc with his colossal new production Start Again, Will delivers a disc packed with future classics with a sound synonymous with Enhanced. Exclusive album material from Estiva in the form of Next Level and Better Days, complete with a breathtaking vocal performance from Josie follow, as do glorious new instrumental productions from EnhancedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s uplifting stars, Suncatcher, Ferry Tayle, Juventa, Temple One and Sequentia. Further anthemic outings from other key members of EnhancedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A-Team Daniel Kandi, Phillip Alpha, Right Face and Stonevalley make this a truly memorable fourth outing in this much lauded series.\n\n\nDisc One\n1.
