The songs &quot;When I Come Home&quot; and &quot;Step Away from the Cliff&quot; have been featured on the medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and &quot;Step Away from the Cliff&quot; on the dark comedy Weeds. West of Lincoln has been described by Allmusic's Alex Henderson as a &quot;softer, more acoustic guitar-friendly effort&quot; than Heilprin's earlier work. Henderson goes on to say the album &quot;has been greatly influenced by the Beatles' more psychedelic work of the late '60s.&quot; Also Elliott Smith fans might be charmed by the simular sound of the music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-Eyed_Son&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-Eyed_Son&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Heilprin has removed his sonic smoke sunglasses to reveal a Blue-Eyed Son. Former front man for surf-punk band 40 Watt Domain, Andrew's musical focus has shifted gears into a stripped down, acoustic orchestration. On June 1st, Andrew's manifestation was released to the world, in the form of Blue-Eyed Son's West of Lincoln.\n\nWest of Lincoln draws on a wide variety of influences but still manages to be as unique as any child's sand castle masterpiece. Building on the back of Andrew and his acoustic guitar, the songs are layered with inspired piano and matched with up-tempo set drums that will help a person get out of bed in the morning. West of Lincoln is an album whose pace rises and falls with the tide, leaving the mark of an indelible listening experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nmusicians:\n\nAndrew Heilprin - vox, guitar\nother great artists appearing on West Of Lincoln:\n\nKoool G.
