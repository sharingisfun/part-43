Armed with a powerful voice that could go from a growl to an eerie falsetto range and a guitar style that had all of the early figures and licks of the Delta style clearly delineated, Johnson only recorded for two years -- from 1928 to 1930 -- but left behind a body of work that's hard to ignore. An essential Tommy Johnson collection, Document's Complete Recorded Works (1928-1929) features 17 songs from the Delta blues pioneer, including two alternative takes and a pair of previously unissued songs known respectively as &quot;Morning Prayer Blues&quot; and &quot;Boogaloosa Blues.&quot; Culled from the great Delta musician's recording sessions in Memphis and Grafton, WI, from February 1928 to December 1929, this collection shines a light on all of Johnson's known output during his most active recording years.\n\n\n  \n\nTracks:\n01 - Cool Drink Of Water Blues\n02 - Big Road Blues\n03 - Bye-Bye Blues\n04 - Maggie Campbell\n05 - Canned Heat Blues\n06 - Lonesome Home Blues (Take 1)\n07 - Lonesome Home Blues (Take 2)\n08 - Big Fat Mama Blues\n09 - I Wonder To Myself\n10 - Lonesome Home Blues\n11 - Slidin' Delta\n12 - Untitled Song - Take 1 (Morning Prayer Blues)\n13 - Untitled Song - Take 2 (Boogaloosa Woman)\n14 - Black Mare Blues (Take 1)\n15 - Black Mare Blues (Take 2)\n16 - Ridin' Horse\n17 - Alcohol And Jake Blues\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c5197062d2283a4afe56ae6189b89c2b72590b","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Tommy+Johnson+-+Canned+Heat+%281928-1929%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c5197062d2283a4afe56ae6189b89c2b72590b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,197,25,112,98,210,40,58,74,254,86,174,97,137,184,156,43,114,89,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
