The notion of relativistic mass is shown to contradict the spirit of relativity theory and the true significance of the mass-energy relation is contrasted with the popular view of it. The author discusses the twin paradox from the point of view of both siblings. Last but not least, the fundamentals of general relativity are described, including the recent Gravity Probe B experiment. \nAbout the Author\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ter HraskÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ received higher education in the Ural State Technological University in Yekaterinburg (former Sverdlovsk in USSR) and Ph.
