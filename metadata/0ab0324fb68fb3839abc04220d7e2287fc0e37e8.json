It is up to Mary to believe for both of them, giving shape to their dreams in the beautiful and mystical volume she keeps in her &quot;Book of Stars and Lovely Things.&quot;\n\nThrough this book, and with the help of her new next door neighbor (Karl Geary), the Professor (Delroy Lindo) and the prisoner (D.B. Sweeney) who has been writing to Penny, Mary hopes she can build a bridge from Penny's past to a more hopeful future.\n================================================================================\n2 files:\nThe Book of Stars.avi 1:37:44\n620x348\n23.97 fps\n679MB\n948 kbps\n\nTrailer.avi 1:59\n620x348\n23.97 fps\n13.4MB\n926 kbps\n\nAudio:\nEnglish\nNo subtitles\nStereo\n128kb/s bitrate\n48000Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ab0324fb68fb3839abc04220d7e2287fc0e37e8","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Stars+%281999%29+-+Jena+Malone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ab0324fb68fb3839abc04220d7e2287fc0e37e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,176,50,79,182,143,179,131,154,188,4,34,13,126,34,135,252,14,55,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
