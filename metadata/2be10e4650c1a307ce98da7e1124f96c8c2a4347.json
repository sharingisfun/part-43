I have lost a partition using Drive Genius 2, and had a resized partition come up as read-only using VolumeWorks. Both problems were recoverable without erasing the whole disk, but if I hadn't had a backup, I'd have lost data in the first instance. Be extra careful with utilities of this kind!\n\n*******************************\n\niPartition has been such a pain in the ass to obtain here on TPB, that I thought I'd upload this alternative from SubRosaSoft. It probably ain't got all the bells and whistles of iPartition, but I tried it recently, and it did the job for me.\n\n\nI just stripped this out of a larger torrent:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5440973/Mac_Bootable_Utilities_Image&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5440973/Mac_Bootable_Utilities_Image&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo, credit to purpl3. The app seems to be cracked because it works when removed from its disk image.\n\nProduct description: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=6:&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.subrosasoft.com/OSXSoftware/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=6:&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nVolumeWorks (version 1.5 - Universal Binary) is an extremely powerful OS X software application for managing the partitions on your hard drive.
