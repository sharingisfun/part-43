Hello (Live Porch Sessions) [ Bonus Track] 4:17 \n\nA group of musicians who draw their inspiration from within, Tripping Lily has deeply explored songwriting with their personal and passionate work. With Demetrius Becrelis (ukulele/guitar/vocals), brother Alex Becrelis (mandolin/vocals), Monica Rizzio (fiddle/ukulele/vocals) ,and Laird Boles (stringed bass), Tripping Lily blends a unique sound of traditional and contemporary genres. The Boston Globe says, &quot;Tripping Lily is a genre unto itself.&quot; Tripping Lily's song &quot;For Five Years or More&quot; went to number one for several weeks on Boston's Folk Station WUMB. Touted as fresh, energetic, and alive, Tripping LilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pop-rock groundwork is cross-fertilized with folk music and cutting edge vocal harmonies. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique ability to absorb traditional music while speaking to the here and now is proof of their versatility as contemporary musicians. Tripping Lily seeks to exploit the empty space of the canvas. They unravel everything theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve known and in turn, end up in a better place. On August 15th, Tripping Lily &quot;TL&quot; will be releasing their long awaited studio recording &quot;The Day Everything Became Nothing.&quot; The band has made a tradition of recording in a similar format to their live performances, which consist of the quartet standing in a slight semi circle with a single microphone placed in the center of their stance. With this record TL decided to take a different approach and headed for the studios at UMass Lowell. The new record consist of fourteen original compositions all written by the members of TL. Of course the band could not completely break tradition, so tracks thirteen and fourteen are bonus tracks, which in fact were recorded live outdoors around a single microphone, where you will hear the usual &quot;to TL&quot; bird chirp, airplane, and even chickens in the background.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/09/tripping-lily/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/09/tripping-lily/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ccbcf63e690ce79ceb7dc3deadd6502d89a421c","amp;dn":"Tripping+Lily...+The+Day+Everything+Became+Nothing%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ccbcf63e690ce79ceb7dc3deadd6502d89a421c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,203,207,99,230,144,206,121,206,183,220,61,234,221,101,2,216,154,66,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
