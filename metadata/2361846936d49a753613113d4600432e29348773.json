It is an expanded limited edition of Cantrell's Degradation Trip album, which was released approximately five months earlier. All the songs were written long prior to the first release of Degradation Trip; Roadrunner Records, uneasy toward the idea of a double album release, made Cantrell condense it but promised to eventually release of all his material. The track order of the expanded version, which differs from the first, is also presented in Cantrell's originally planned order.[1] Faith No More drummer Mike Bordin and then-Ozzy Osbourne/Black Label Society bassist Robert Trujillo (formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and later of Metallica) contributed to Degradation Trip and would tour with Cantrell in support of it.\n\n-Wiki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2361846936d49a753613113d4600432e29348773","amp;dn":"Jerry+Cantrell+Degradation+Trip+Volumes+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2361846936d49a753613113d4600432e29348773","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,97,132,105,54,212,154,117,54,19,17,61,70,0,67,46,41,52,135,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
