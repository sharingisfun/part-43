The user can customize the method      \n   of naming backup files adding, for example, the date of          \n   archiving to file names. ABC Backup uses the zip algorithm      \n   to archive data. It is fully gzip compatible (which is          \n   important for GNU utilities users and in cross-platform          \n   environments.) A built-in task scheduler helps you to build      \n   a queue of automated backups, uploads, downloads, or run        \n   third-party utilities to process the data before or after        \n   copying/archiving. ABC Backup has no limitations on the          \n   number of scheduled tasks. \n\n\nInstructions\n1) unpack\n2) Install\n3) Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c947b0110ab4163a867daa673aeab39b426a4639","amp;dn":"ABC+Backup+Pro+v5.20+RETAIL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c947b0110ab4163a867daa673aeab39b426a4639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,71,176,17,10,180,22,58,134,125,170,103,58,234,179,155,66,106,70,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
