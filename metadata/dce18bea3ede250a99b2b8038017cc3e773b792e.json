Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas.\n\nAnd Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealousy but determined not to show her feelings.\n\nAs romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one.\n\nLove is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton, Helena Bonham Carter\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce18bea3ede250a99b2b8038017cc3e773b792e","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+6+%5B2009%5D+-+DVDrip+DivX7+-+Omifast+Greek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce18bea3ede250a99b2b8038017cc3e773b792e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,225,139,234,62,222,37,10,153,178,184,3,128,23,204,62,119,59,121,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
