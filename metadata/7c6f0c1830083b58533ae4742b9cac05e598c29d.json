Paul Attanasio has forged a highly respected career\n as a master of challenging film adaptations. His nuanced and gripping screenplays for Quiz\n Show and Donnie Brasco earned him Oscar nominations, and he brought sexy, character-driven\n life to the Michael Crichton page-turner, Disclosure. The Bronx-born writer created the\n acclaimed Peabody Award-winning television show Homicide: Life on the Street, and he serves as\n executive producer of the popular medical drama, House, M.D. Also a frequently hired script\n doctor, Attanasio most recently adapted the post-World War II novel The Good German for\n director Steven Soderbergh. In this intense dialogue, Attanasio describes how he went from\n lambasting movies as a &quot;snotty&quot; Washington Post film critic to developing explosive and\n rewarding creative partnerships with Oscar-winning directors Robert Redford, Barry Levinson,\n and Soderbergh. \n\n\n  \n enjoy!                                                                  \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                     \n      Release notes                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                    \n                                                                     \n     Greetings                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c6f0c1830083b58533ae4742b9cac05e598c29d","amp;dn":"The.Dialogue.Paul.Attanasio.2007.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c6f0c1830083b58533ae4742b9cac05e598c29d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,111,12,24,48,8,59,88,83,58,228,116,43,156,172,5,229,152,194,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
