The Braxtons originally started out in 1989. The first signed as a fivesome to Arista Records which consisted of Toni Braxton and her 4 sisters, Tamar, Trina, Towanda and Traci. In 1990, they released their first single &quot;Good Life&quot;. It would be their only single as a foursome. &quot;Good Life&quot; was not a hit and The Braxtons were dropped from Arista Records and even though It wasn't a hit, Toni Braxton's lead vocals caught the attention of Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid and Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds who were in the process of forming LaFace Records and Toni signed as a solo artist. The Braxtons broke up. In 1996, 3 out of the 4 Braxtons, Trina, Tamar and Townada reunited and released their album So Many Ways. The fourth remaining Braxton sister, Traci was not allowed to sign with the group due to her pregnancy at the time. The Braxtons officially disbanded for good after So Many Ways when Tamar Braxton went solo.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] So Many Ways\n[02] Slow Flow\n[03] Only Love\n[04] I'd Still Say Yes\n[05] L.A.D.I.\n[06] Take Home To Momma\n[07] Where's The Good In Goodbye\n[08] What Does It Take\n[09] Girl On The Side\n[10] In A Special Way\n[11] Never Say Goodbye\n[12] The Boss\n \n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:59m:24s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 148mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t\t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B\n\nRelease Date\t\t- Atlantic Recording\n\nRecord Company\t\t- 13 August 1996\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Braxtons\n\t                  -\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5855542ea144cc679cab65fef6ef39de42cc4b74","amp;dn":"%5B1996%5D+So+Many+Ways+-+The+Braxtons+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5855542ea144cc679cab65fef6ef39de42cc4b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,85,84,46,161,68,204,103,156,171,101,254,246,239,57,222,66,204,75,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
