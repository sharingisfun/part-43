Bert chooses a video of an old PixelPerfect episode as an example. He then creates a frame around the video using separate layers.\n\n*** Create a 3D Postcard from the video layer\nWith the video layer selected, choose 3D &gt; New 3D Postcard from Layer. Nothing will change in the appearance of the layer until you rotate the movie using 3D controls. Apply the 3D settings to both the video and the frame, then merge all the layers so that they become one unit that moves together. Adjust the positioning of individual layers by using the 3D Scene window.\n\n*** Apply video to a 3D shape\nIn a separate example, Bert demonstrates Photoshop's ability to apply video to a 3D shape. He creates an example of a curvy object made from a black and white gradient (3D &gt; New Mesh from Grayscale &gt; Plane). To add the video to this shape, open the 3D object layer and choose Layer &gt; Video Layer &gt; New Video Layer. When you save and close this window, you'll see that the video is a part of the wavy 3D shape.\n\n*** Create animation\nIn the Animation window, lock the object position. Shorten the movie length to about 5 seconds. At the 4 second mark, rotate and change position of the 3D object. When done, Export &gt; Render Video, then choose your video output settings. This will take a few moments before your exported 3D video can be viewed. \n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAll episodes can be streamed at Revision3 (duh!) but they can also be downloaded directly from the Revision3 site (they redirect to fast bitgravity servers) at various resolutions and video formats.
