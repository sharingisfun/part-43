Although Halliday and Resnick's book was the textbook chosen by the Physics Department, many students were observed by the faculty to be studying from Serway's book. The students had acquired old used versions of the Serway book, and they were actively studying out of this book rather than the prescribed textbook. Serway's book became our students' popular choice. The Physics Department, recognizing this, adopted a &quot;give them what they want&quot; attitude, and accordingly Serway's book was made the textbook for the calculus-based undergraduate physics course.&quot;\n\nProduct Description\nThis best-selling, calculus-based text is recognized for its carefully crafted, logical presentation of the basic concepts and principles of physics. PHYSICS FOR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS, Sixth Edition, maintains the Serway traditions of concise writing for the students, carefully thought-out problem sets and worked examples, and evolving educational pedagogy. This edition introduces a new co-author, Dr. John Jewett, at Cal Poly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pomona, known best for his teaching awards and his role in the recently published PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICS, Third Edition, also written with Ray Serway. Providing students with the tools they need to succeed in introductory physics, the Sixth Edition of this authoritative text features unparalleled media integration and a newly enhanced supplemental package for instructors and students!\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 1408 pages\nPublisher: Brooks Cole; 6 edition (July 21, 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0534408427\nISBN-13: 978-0534408428","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0288139819a438d06dfb751698655b456d20014b","amp;dn":"Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+6th+Edition+-+Serway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0288139819a438d06dfb751698655b456d20014b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,136,19,152,25,164,56,208,109,251,117,22,152,101,91,69,109,32,1,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
