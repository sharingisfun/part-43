Pollan has been advising clients and readers on the business of livingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½everything from home buying and employment contracts to marriage and parenting. He has taught his clients and readers to Die Broke (use assets rather than build up an estate), to stage Second Acts (reinvent their lives), and, most recently, to Fire Your Boss (take charge of their own work lives).\n\nThroughout these books, Pollan stresses that attitudes as well as actions are essential to success. Indeed, over the years he realized that the happiest and most successful people he'd met were also those who were the most energetic and exuberant, regardless of their age. By noting these attributes and incorporating them in his own life, Pollan came to understand that our attitudes are not just one element of succeeding at the business of living, they are in fact the foundation of leading a happy life.\n\nAttitude is everything.\n\nThose attitudes most essential to our deepest satisfaction and happiness reflect what our spiritual leaders and philosophers from every major tradition have taught us. We don't have to look to external forces to validate us and give us self-worth. We already have within us all we need to find fulfillment and lead happy, satisfying livesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½lives without regrets.\n\nTo finally be happy we need to accept responsibility for our own happiness. When we know the secrets are already inside us, all we have to do is start living them. With this book, we can begin now.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d61e61c5efc4855fd1509df8b19f0c9bee0d426","amp;dn":"It%5C%27s+All+in+Your+Head++Thinking+Your+Way+to+Happiness-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d61e61c5efc4855fd1509df8b19f0c9bee0d426","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,97,230,28,94,252,72,85,253,21,9,223,139,25,240,201,190,224,212,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
