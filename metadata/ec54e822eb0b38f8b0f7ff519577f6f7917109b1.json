This afternoon set was a rager and included standout versions of Broke Down On The Brazos &amp; Slackjaw Jezebel. What's a day on the beach without friends? It was Davy Knowles sitting in on Almost Cut My Hair and Grace Potter adding her beautiful voice to Gold Dust Woman that really put this show over the top. The Hangout Music Festival was quite the beach party.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec54e822eb0b38f8b0f7ff519577f6f7917109b1","amp;dn":"Gov%5C%27t+Mule+-+LIVE+05%2F15%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+Gulf+Shores%2C+AL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec54e822eb0b38f8b0f7ff519577f6f7917109b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,84,232,34,235,11,56,248,176,247,255,81,149,119,246,247,145,113,9,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
