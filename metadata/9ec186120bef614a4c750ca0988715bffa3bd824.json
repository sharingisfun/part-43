Wolverine is a mutant,\npossessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually \nany wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\nThe first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to rescue Mariko from her father.\nAt this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan \nadventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his concepts of honor and family. \n\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nSynopsis:\n--------------\n\nEpisode 10 is Titled &quot;Kurohagi&quot;\n\nAs The rebels continue their Assault on the main Entrance to the Dragon Palace Koh and Yukio are\nconfronted by Mariko's Father who intends to finish the assassination of the family that he began \nmany years before. Logan is able to hear this meeting with his mutant senses and the ceremony in \nanother part of the palace  Where Kurohagi is trying to hurry through with the wedding and he has to \ndecide which to go to first. He chooses to help Yuriko and Koh but arrives too late to stop Koh sacrificing\nhimself to save Yuriko.When the Bridge they are standing on is hit by a missile the fight is interupted and Logan \nruns off to the ceremony while Yuriko stays with the dieing Koh. In a scene very much like &quot;The Graduate&quot;\nLogan finally arrives at the ceremony and swears to take Mariko away. Just as Logan has his hands on Kurohagi\nMariko's father arrives and with his &quot;Wind of Blade&quot; attack he injurs Logan long enough for Kurohagi to\ndrag Mariko away once more...\n\nJapanese cast:\n---------------\nRikiya Koyama as James Howlett Logan/Wolverine\nFumiko Orikasa as Mariko Yashida\nHidekatsu Shibata as Shingen Yashida\nKazuki Yao as Hideki Kurohagi\nMasaki Terasoma as Tesshin Asano\nMasato Hagiwara as Kikyo Mikage\nRomi Park as Yukio\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n-----------\nOnce again, All credit for subtitle translation goes to Weapon+\nwithout their work my avi conversion would be pretty useless :)\n\nI would also like to apologise for my earlier synopsese where I wrongly named \nKurohagi junior as Shingen, who is in fact Mariko's father, not her Fiance, big ooops.\n\nSpoken Language:-   Japanese\nSubtitled Language:- English\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 174M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:29.676\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : DX50\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42248\nVideoBitRate       : 903605\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 123432\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFile Format:- AVI\n------------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:-\n-------------\n[URL=http://img849.imageshack.us/i/wolverineanime11kurohag.jpg/][IMG]http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/4222/wolverineanime11kurohag.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\nHash:\n-----------\n9EC186120BEF614A4C750CA0988715BFFA3BD824\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace on irc.cartoonpalace.info for more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n[url]http://www.cartoonpalace.info/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec186120bef614a4c750ca0988715bffa3bd824","amp;dn":"Wolverine%5Banime%5D-111-Kurohagi-Eng-Subs-Divx-%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec186120bef614a4c750ca0988715bffa3bd824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,193,134,18,11,239,97,74,76,117,12,160,152,135,21,191,250,59,216,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
