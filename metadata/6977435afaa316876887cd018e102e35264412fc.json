The disk image is an exact copy of a physical disk (floppy, \n  CD-ROM, hard disk, USB, VHD disk, etc.) or a partition that preserves the \noriginal structure. With WinImage in place, you can recreate the disk image on \n the hard drive or other media, view its content, extract image-based files, \n add new files and directories, change the format, and defragment the image. \n All this and more is delivered in one intuitive user interface that enables \n                        imaging right out of the box.  \n     \nThe program has many utilitarian uses at home and in the office. As a serious \n  PC user, you probably have tons of old but still useful floppy disks. With \nWinImage in place, you can turn them into disk images, which can be stored on \n  the hard drive and recreated, when a need arises. In combination with a CD \n  creating tool, WinImage can help you create your own custom boot disk with \n hardware diagnostic or virus cleaning software to bring a problem PC back up \nand running without being in Windows. As a hard-disk backup solution, WinImage \n allows you to save hours and even days restoring a system and configurations \n on a machine that has experienced a hard-disk crash or software corruption. \n  Along with homes and offices, this ability is a must for training classes, \n      where restoring torn down PC configurations quickly is critical.  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n                      WinImage has many cool features!  \n     \n     \n                    WinImage is now Windows 7 compatible   \n     \n Create a disk image from a removable drive (like USB drive), CD-ROM, floppy, \n     \n                     Extract file(s) from a disk image,  \n     \n                          Create empty disk images,  \n     \n          Inject files and directories into an existing disk image,  \n     \n                         Change a disk image format,  \n     \n                          Defragment a disk image,  \n     \n  A powerful &quot;Batch assistant&quot; mode that lets you automate many operations,  \n     \n                               And many more!  \n     \n     \n                       \n                            &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.winimage.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.winimage.com&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n            \n                                                        \n                          1) Unzip, Unrar \n                                    \n                          2) Import winimage.reg and run setup \n                                    \n                          3) Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6977435afaa316876887cd018e102e35264412fc","amp;dn":"WinImage.v8.50.x32.x64-ArCADE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6977435afaa316876887cd018e102e35264412fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,119,67,90,250,163,22,135,104,135,205,1,142,16,46,53,38,68,18,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
