The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Hydrogeology is a practical, comprehensive reference guide with complete definitions of terms in hydrogeology and other fields closely related to water practices. \n\n\nThis concise reference not only defines terms and concepts, but also provides a clear explanation of key elements so that an in-depth understanding of processes may be obtained.\n\n* With more than 2,000 entries, from &quot;absolute permeability&quot; to the &quot;Z-R relationship&quot;, this dictionary features the most up-to-date vocabulary in hydrology and hydrogeology. This dictionary would be of use to practicing scientists and professionals in all the fields of water science.\n\n\n* More than 340 graphs, tables and diagrams complement the entries in order to clarify terms, methods, or processes\n\n\n* Essential reference for students, academics, consultants, and practitioners in hydrology, hydrogeology, environmental engineering, environmental law, and the government\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbea62389ed5265c234dd8b78f8aeceadd9112c2","amp;dn":"Encyclopedic+Dictionary+of+Hydrogeology+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbea62389ed5265c234dd8b78f8aeceadd9112c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,234,98,56,158,213,38,92,35,77,216,183,143,138,236,234,221,145,18,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
