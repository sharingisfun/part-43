Three days later, another B-29 dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki. The Japanese government, which had been preparing a bloody defense against an invasion, surrendered six days later. The aircraft was the primary artifact in an exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum from 1995 to 1998. The original, controversial exhibit script was changed, and the final exhibition attracted some 4 million visitors, testifying to the enduring interest in the aircraft and its mission. \n\nThis book tells the story of the Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 program, and the combat operations of the B-29 type.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4c248a66fddf38a02e54ed322518db8b814b4e6","amp;dn":"The+Enola+Gay+-+The+B-29+That+Dropped+the+Atomic+Bomb+on+Hiroshi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4c248a66fddf38a02e54ed322518db8b814b4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,194,72,166,111,221,243,138,2,229,78,211,34,81,141,184,184,20,180,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
