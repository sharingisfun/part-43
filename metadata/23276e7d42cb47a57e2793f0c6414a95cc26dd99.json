It depicts Batman battling against the mob of Gotham City, as well as other villains. The producers have acknowledged that it is not necessarily meant to be canon to the &quot;Nolanverse,&quot; and indeed any of the six segments could easily fall into almost any Batman continuity. The shorts, or segments, are written by Josh Olson, David S. Goyer, Brian Azzarello, Greg Rucka, Jordan Goldberg and Alan Burnett. Although all based on Japanese anime art style, each segment has its own writing and artistic style, just as the works from the DC Universe, and with the same style of The Animatrix although some segments are connected.All six films of the feature star Kevin Conroy, reprising his voice role as Batman from the DC Animated Universe.\n\n\nBatman: Gotham Knight\n\nDirected by Executive:\nToshi Hiruma\nBruce Timm\nCo-Director:\nShojiro Nishimi\nFutoshi Higashide\nHiroshi Morioka\nYasuhiro Aoki\nToshiyuki Kubooka\nJong-Sik Nam\n\n\n\n\n\nHave I Got a Story for You (Studio 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C)\n\nHave I Got a Story for You was written by Josh Olson and animated by Studio 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C. A street kid meets with his three friends at a skate park. All three of them claim to have seen Batman earlier that day. Batman's battle with the Man in Black, a high-tech criminal, is told in reverse chronological order, with three very different interpretations of Batman's form and abilities: one describes him as a living shadow that can melt away and reappear at will (similar to Vampire Batman), another describes him as a half-human, half-bat creature (similar to Man-Bat), and one describes him as a combat robot that can leap tall buildings in a single bound. At the end, Batman pursues the Man in Black to the skate park, and captures him with the help of the fourth street kid. The fourth kid is able to see what Batman truly is after seeing him sustain injuries from the battle: a very human warrior in a costume. He proceeded to tell his experience to his friends after Batman disappeared.\n\nacknowledgment to first-time writer Jordan Goldberg, Josh Olson acknowledged it was actually based on a very similar story by Frank Robbins called &quot;The Batman Nobody Knows&quot;.[6] The story was first printed in Batman #250 in 1973, and subsequently adapted as &quot;Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; in the original Batman: The Animated Series. According to Olson: &quot;The first time it's stealing, the second time it's borrowing, the third time you're creating a genre&quot;.[6]\n\nAlso, the three different versions of the man in black have many similarities to other members of Batman's Rogues gallery, though they all resemble a member of the League of Shadows. The first story features a tech-wielding villain who has teeth similar to Killer Croc, the second uses a jetpack, which may or may not be a reference to Firefly, and the third has similarities to Deadshot. Also, the Batman of the second encounter is very similar to the villain Man-Bat. When the Man in Black is seen by all the teenagers, he has no identifiable characteristics.\n\nLastly, the story is told backwards, with the kid who claims he saw Batman most recently going first, ending with the kid who actually saw him first, in a tongue in cheek homage to Batman Begins and The Dark Knight's director Christopher Nolan's earlier film Memento.\n\n\nCrossfire (Production I.G)\n\nCrossfire was written by Greg Rucka and animated by Production I.G.. Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez are partners and members of the Major Crimes Unit that have been hand-picked by James Gordon. The two are assigned to take the recently captured Man in Black (captured during Have I Got A Story For You), revealed to be Jacob Feely, an escaped inmate from Arkham Asylum with an expertise in advanced electronics and explosives, to the Narrows to be incarcerated. On their way, they argue over whether Batman can be trusted, with Allen saying that they are just running errands for a vigilante, while Ramirez replies that Batman has changed Gotham for the better. As they are heading back, Allen declares his intention to leave the MCU, and Ramirez pulls into a vacant lot to confront Allen. However, the two get caught in a confrontation between gangs, The Russian and Sal Maroni. Maroni's men are gunned down, and Maroni takes refuge behind Allen and Ramirez's patrol car, which The Russian subsequently destroys with a rocket launcher. Ramirez and Maroni manage to get clear in time, while Allen is rescued by Batman, who proceeds to take out The Russian and his men. Maroni then threatens to kill Ramirez, but he, too, is dispatched by Batman. Batman recognizes Allen and Ramirez as Gordon's hand-picked officers, remarks that Gordon is a good judge of character, and disappears.\n\nField Test (Bee Train)\n\nField Test was written by Jordan Goldberg and animated by Bee Train. An accident involving a new WayneCom satellite's gyroscopic electromagnetic guidance system gives Lucius Fox an idea to create a device with the satellite's gyro with an advanced motion sensor that will electromagnetically deflect small-arms fire. Bruce Wayne takes the device and attends a charity golf tournament being held by developer Ronald Marshall, with whom he discusses the mysterious death of a woman, Teresa Williams, who had opposed some of Marshall's plans. During the tournament, Wayne secretly takes Marshall's PDA device. Later that night, as Batman, he hijacks a boat owned by Sal Maroni and drives it alongside a boat owned by rival gang leader, The Russian, and proceeds to attack both gangs at once, with assistance from his new device. He attempts to force a truce between the two gang leaders until he can get evidence against them, but is disrupted when one of Maroni's men fires at him. The bullet deflects and instead hits one of The Russian's men. Distressed, Batman takes the injured man to the hospital. Later, he returns the device to Fox, stating, &quot;... it works too well; I'm willing to put my life on the line to do what I have to. But it has to be mine, no one else's.&quot;\n\n\nIn Darkness Dwells (Madhouse)\n\nIn Darkness Dwells, was written by David S. Goyer and animated by Madhouse. The police respond to a riot in a cathedral where Cardinal O'Fallon was giving a sermon. According to eyewitness testimony, the Cardinal was abducted by a large lizard-monster and taken down into the crypts below the cathedral. Lieutenant Gordon, Crispus Allen, and Anna Ramirez investigate; Gordon has a brief conversation with Batman, who agrees with Gordon's theory that the Scarecrow's fear toxin is behind the riot as the doctor has been at large since the riot at the Narrows (during the event of Batman Begins). Batman gives Gordon an earpiece that will allow them to stay in contact and descends below ground, trying to find Cardinal O'Fallon and his abductor. A homeless man living in an abandoned subway station identifies the abductor as Killer Croc. Batman and Gordon briefly discuss the villain's past, but are cut off when Killer Croc himself shows up, under the influence of the fear toxin, and attacks Batman. Batman defeats him, but not before sustaining a bite that transfers some of the toxin to him. He then finds Cardinal O'Fallon being put on trial and sentenced to death by the Scarecrow, who is unhappy with O'Fallon's efforts to help the homeless. Batman leaps in to defend the Cardinal. Using the methane already present in the room, he sparks an explosion that destroys several water pipes, flooding the area and allowing him to escape with the Cardinal. Gordon appears in a helicopter to retrieve the Cardinal. The Cardinal offers to help Batman, but Batman refuses, saying, &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;\n\n\nWorking Through Pain (Studio 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C)\n\nWorking Through Pain was written by Brian Azzarello and animated by Studio 4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°C. Continuing on from In Darkness Dwells, Batman is shot in the stomach by a man hallucinating in the sewers of Gotham.\n\nHe cauterizes the wound and attempts to get out from underground, reflecting on his experiences with managing pain as he does so. First, he remembers volunteering with a relief effort and assisting a doctor in performing surgery without anesthesia. Next, he reflects on the lessons he learned from a woman named Cassandra, who was cast out of her community for disguising herself as a boy in an attempt to become a Fakir. Over several months, she teaches him to minimize his pain to the point where he can control it, sleeping on a bed of needles or standing on hot coals without reacting. One night, several young men appear to harass Cassandra, who takes their blows without seeming to feel them. Bruce steps in to defend her, not only demonstrating his ability to withstand their attacks, but defeating them all with his martial arts skills. Cassandra then tells him to leave, saying that he has learned what he came to learn.\n\nShe then comments on how Bruce's pain was beyond her, or possibly even his, ability to handle, but how it also appeared to be leading him down a path he desired. Back in the present, Batman ends up in a gutter, where he discovers a cache of guns buried in the garbage. Alfred arrives to assist him and tells Batman to give him his hand so he can pull him out of the gutter, but Batman, arms full of guns, replies that he cannot.\n\n\nDeadshot (Madhouse)\n\nDeadshot was written by Alan Burnett and animated by Madhouse. Bruce Wayne has a flashback to the murder of his parents. In his penthouse, he examines the firearms he took from the underground tunnel's gutter (during the event of Working Through Pain) which he intends to turn in to the police. Wayne admits to Alfred that even though he vowed never to use them in the memory of his parents, he can still understand the temptation to use one. Meanwhile, in another city, an assassin known as Deadshot carries out an assassination on a local mayor with a spectacularly difficult shot from a ferris wheel literally miles away from the man and returns to his tropical base. There, one of his associates hires him to carry out a hit in Gotham. It is revealed that The Russian has put out a hit on Lieutenant Gordon, and Batman is called in to protect him. Batman gives Crispus Allen Ronald Marshall's handheld PDA device (which he stole as Bruce Wayne in Field Test), containing a link to encrypted e-mails proving that Ronald Marshall hired Deadshot in the past. He then follows Gordon's motorcade, with Alfred providing satellite-imagery assistance using the new WayneCom satellites. Deadshot attempts to shoot Gordon from a moving train, but Batman deflects the bullet. Deadshot then gleefully reveals that Batman was his real target the entire time, and that the threat against Gordon was merely a ruse to draw him out. He opens fire as the train enters a tunnel, and as Batman attempts to charge Deadshot, he is injured, falling off the train. Deadshot advances to where he saw Batman fall, gloating, but is ambushed from behind and disarmed. He and Ronald Marshall are arrested. Wayne confides to Alfred about how similar the fight in the tunnel seemed to the night his parents were murdered, and comments that &quot;I've been trying to stop those two bullets all my life.&quot; He expresses discouragement, and Alfred agrees, but adds that he thinks Bruce has a higher purpose. Bruce then looks up at the sky and sees the Bat-Signal.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : Batman Gotham Knight BluRay 1080p AC3 ITA ENG JAP.mkv\nFormat : Matroska\nFile size : 4.73 GiB\nDuration : 1h 15mn\nOverall bit rate : 8 913 Kbps\nMovie name : Mux by Colleromito\nEncoded date : UTC 2011-04-08 12:45:51\nWriting application : mkvmerge v4.3.0 ('Escape from the Island') built on Sep 5 2010 10:30:51\nWriting library : libebml v1.0.0 + libmatroska v1.0.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7830111f1038344c5649&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration : 1h 15mn\nBit rate : 7 404 Kbps\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.149\nStream size : 3.82 GiB (81%)\n\nAudio #1\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 1h 15mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nVideo delay : 1s 0ms\nStream size : 139 MiB (3%)\nTitle : AC3 - 256 kbit/sec (Italiano)\nLanguage : Italian\n\nAudio #2\nID : 3\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 1h 15mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 640 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 348 MiB (7%)\nTitle : AC3 - 640 kbit/sec (English)\nLanguage : English\n\nAudio #3\nID : 4\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nMuxing mode : Header stripping\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nDuration : 1h 15mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 640 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nStream size : 348 MiB (7%)\nTitle : AC3 - 640 kbit/sec (Japanese)\nLanguage : Japanese\n\nText #1\nID : 5\nFormat : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage : Italian\n\nText #2\nID : 6\nFormat : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage : English\n\nText #3\nID : 7\nFormat : UTF-8\nCodec ID : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage : Dutch\n\nMenu\n00:00:00.000 : en:Intro\n00:00:59.000 : en:Have I got a story for you\n00:12:49.000 : en:Crossfire\n00:24:49.000 : en:Field Test\n00:35:46.000 : en:In Darkness Dwells\n00:46:21.000 : en:Working Through Pain\n00:59:26.000 : en:Deadshot\n01:10:51.000 : en:End Credits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23276e7d42cb47a57e2793f0c6414a95cc26dd99","amp;dn":"Batman+Gotham+Knight+%5BBDrip+x264+1080p+Ac3+ITA+ENG+JAP+Multisub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23276e7d42cb47a57e2793f0c6414a95cc26dd99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,39,110,125,66,203,71,165,126,39,147,240,198,65,74,149,204,38,221,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
