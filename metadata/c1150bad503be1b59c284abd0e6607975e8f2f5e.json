Safe, no ads, pure, non-denominational site.\n\nNow about this upload.\nSocrates once said, &quot;I know you won't believe me, but the highest form of Human Excellence is to question oneself and others.&quot; :-)\n\n- In 1859, Charles Darwin published, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the Origin of Species.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In it, he argued that all of life on earth was the product of undirected natural processes\n\nTime, chance, and natural selection. Since Darwin, biologists have relied on such processes to account for the origin of living things.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUnlocking the Mystery of LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the story of contemporary scientists who are advancing a powerful, but controversial, ideaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the theory of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œintelligent design.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It is a theory based upon compelling biochemical evidence. \t\t\t\t\n\nThrough state-of-the-art computer animation, Unlocking the Mystery of Life transports you into the interior of the living cell to explore systems and machines that bear the unmistakable hallmarks of design. Discover the intricacy of a microscopic bacterial rotary motor, which spins at 100,000 rpm.\n\nWithin the cell nucleus explore the wonder of DNA, a threadlike molecule that stores instructions to build the essential components of every living organism. It is part of a biological information processing system more complex and more powerful than any computer network.\n\nThis remarkable documentary examines the scientific case for intelligent design - an idea with the power to revolutionize our understanding of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and to unlock the mystery of its origin.\n\nAlso Included in this Folder is the Script to the whole documentary as pdf, plus the extra material from the DVD, all as high Quality Xvid or DivX.\n\nLove from Verifire.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9aecffe8f3fcf3e8fff7fbf3f6dafdf7fbf3f6b4f9f5f7&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1150bad503be1b59c284abd0e6607975e8f2f5e","amp;dn":"Unlocking+the+Mysteries+of+Life+%5BHQ%5D%5B3+DivX+%2B+Script%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1150bad503be1b59c284abd0e6607975e8f2f5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,21,11,173,80,59,225,181,156,40,74,189,14,102,7,151,94,143,47,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
