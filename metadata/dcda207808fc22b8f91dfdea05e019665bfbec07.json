State, 152 Tenn. 424, 278 S.W. 57 (Tenn. 1925),\narose from a prosecution under Tennessee's 1925 'Butler Act' which\nprohibited state funded schools from teaching &quot; ... any theory that\ndenies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and\nto teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.&quot; \n\nFully engaging, and at times very funny. Odd, though, to hear Ed Asner\nputting the conservatives' position.\n\nCast\nNarrator - Tyne Daly\nJudge John Raulston - John Randolph \nAttorney General Stewart - Harris Yulin\nWilliams Jennings Bryan - Edward Asner\nMorgan - Danny Cooksey\nJohn Thomas Scopes - Jeff Corbett\nClarence Darrow  - Charles Durning\nShelton - Walt Goggins\nDudley Field Malone - Harold Gould\nArthur Garfield Hays - Gerrit Graham\nMetcalf - Gerrit Graham\nThe Spectator - Peter Jacobs\nBailiff - Macon McCalman \nGeneral Ben McKenzie - Logan Ramsey\nH.L.
