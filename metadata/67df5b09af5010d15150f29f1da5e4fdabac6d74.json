With more pantyshots then bloodsplatter Rosario+Vampire is a nice manga to relax with when not in the mood for something more serious.\n\nSome might argue that this is not complete since there is a second season, but since most manga indexing sites list them two different series i have decided to do the same.\n\nAs always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.\n\nAnd the usual disclaimer. nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. credits pages and possibly some fan art are included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nSummery (From Mangatraders)\n\nBy a bizarre coincidence, Tsukune Aono has accidentally gotten himself admitted to a youkai acadamy, a school attended by monsters (youkai). Just when he thinks he'll run away from there, he meets the beautiful girl Moka and his mood turns ultra happy. However, she transforms into her true form when the rosary on her chest is taken off, she's a vampire!\n\nBut the more he stays the more adventures await him. He meets new people that fall for him and try anything to get him for themselves! Let`s see what else is in store for him!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67df5b09af5010d15150f29f1da5e4fdabac6d74","amp;dn":"%5BManga%5D+Roasario%2BVampire+%5Bcomplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67df5b09af5010d15150f29f1da5e4fdabac6d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,223,91,9,175,80,16,209,81,80,242,159,29,165,228,253,171,172,109,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
