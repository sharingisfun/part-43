The Production Assistant plug-in automates many frequent tasks and processes to save hours of tedious editing work. And, with a complete set of video tutorials to help you get started, it's easy to use.\nWorkflow Automation Tools\n\nThe Vegas Pro Production Assistant plug-in includes tools to automatically insert crossfades between clips, add and customize lower thirds, and create photo and video montages from your media. It also streamlines common tasks such as stereo to mono split, crossfade creation, audio ducking, and archiving. More about workflow automation tools\n\nProject Templates\n\nSetting up a Vegas Pro project as a templateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with your regularly used titles, lower thirds, credits, and empty placeholder events ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is a powerful way to save time on repetitive tasks. The Production Assistant takes efficiency to a whole new level. Simply select the media you want to replace your placeholder slugs, click to process, and voila! Your project is ready to go. With project templates, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never have to start with an empty project again!\n\nBatch Processing\n\nBatch processing in the Vegas Pro Production Assistant goes well beyond your run-of-the-mill media encoders. You can select multiple files, multiple output formats, and walk away while Vegas Pro and the Production Assistant output every format you desire. But what really sets the Production Assistant apart is the ability to treat multiple files with processes such as image overlay, aspect ratio convert, broadcast color correction, normalize audio, reduce interlace flicker, adjust playback rate, and more.\n\nMore about batch processing\n\nNew! Hands-free Media Card Workflow\n\nImagine being able to insert a card into a card reader and walk away, never touching the application until after a finished video file is complete! With Vegas Pro Production Assistant a template can be specified which allows a project to be completely hands-free from card insertion to final output.\n\nNew! Automated File-Based Format Cataloging\n\nInsert a memory card, and Vegas Pro Production Assistant 2 will auto-transfer content to folders on your hard drive. This process ensures that all of your footage, along with everything Vegas Pro needs to open your files, is transferred successfully from the memory card to your machine.\n\nHome Page - http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/vegasproassist\n\n***************************************************************************\nxoxoxoxoxox\nx N O T E x\nxoxoxoxoxox\n\n1.

Why??\\'\nA: It\\'s because you\\'re missing certain codecs. There\\'s 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you\\'ve downloaded\n\nQ: \\'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!\\'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. \n\n   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it\\'s false positive.\n\n   Well, if you\\'re still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: \\'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?\\'\nA: Most probably you\\'re banned. Don\\'t worry, drop by to the forum &amp; explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772\n\nQ: \\'I registered an account on TPB, but i don\\'t receive any of the confirmation/activation email.
