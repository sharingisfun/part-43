With access to exclusive weaponry and equipment, your actions will tip the balance during the most dangerous time period mankind has ever known.\n\n1. Port Info CiderX 4473\n\n2. Recommended System Requirements:\nMac OS X 10.5.8\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2.8 GHZ\n512 MB Shader 3.0 Dedicated Video Card\n4 GB RAM\n9 GB Free Hard Disk\n\n3. Known Issues:\nLag... This will be fixed by treynarch in a patch (they are working on it) as PC versions have the same problems.\n\nMy Personal Notes:\nThis has campaign, single player zombies, and multiplayer w/ bots\nAll instructions necessary are in the readme.\nAll the game modes lag like a bitch when you first start them but the fps gradually improves as you play.\nMutliplayer isn't really multiplayer, it's like combat training. (For those of you who don't have the legit black ops game, combat training is when everything is exactly like multiplayer, but you fight against computer controlled enemies)\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be97d9eb1df4700ee316dc24866276c9a5a3327c","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty%3A+Black+Ops+%28CiderX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be97d9eb1df4700ee316dc24866276c9a5a3327c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,151,217,235,29,244,112,14,227,22,220,36,134,98,118,201,165,163,50,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
