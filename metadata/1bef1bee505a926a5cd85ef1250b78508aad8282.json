You play as a person who has survived a catastrophe of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), while everyone else in the city has been transformed into a bloodthirsty zombie. You return to the abandoned city, looking for a way to change the zombies back into humans. The only way to survive is to move on fast armored vehicles. The player will complete different missions: racing, rescue and more to finally learn the truth.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n\n\n\n*** OS: Microsoft Windows XP/Vista\n\n*** Processor: Pentium IV 2.5 / AMD Athlon 2800+\n\n*** Memory: 512 MB RAM (768MB for Vista)\n\n*** Graphics: 9.0c DirectX-compatible video card with 128 MB of memory, supports shader model 2\n\n*** Hard Drive: 1 GB\n\n*** Sound: DirectX-compatible\n\n*** Supports XBOX 360 controller \n\n\n\nRecommended Configuration:\n\n\n\n*** Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2\n\n*** Memory: 1GB \n\n*** Graphics: 256MB video card with support for Pixel Shader 3.0 (Nvidia Geforce 7900GT or higher)\n\n\nPlay and N'joy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bef1bee505a926a5cd85ef1250b78508aad8282","amp;dn":"Clutch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bef1bee505a926a5cd85ef1250b78508aad8282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,239,27,238,80,90,146,106,92,216,94,241,37,11,120,80,138,173,130,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
