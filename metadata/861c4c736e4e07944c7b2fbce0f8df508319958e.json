Gerald Wilson's script, which is based on a novel by John Gardner, is pure pulp with a plot that lards its multiple twists and turns with an equal amount of bullet-riddled corpses. The dialogue might work in plenty of sermons on social ills (everything from race relations to the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans) but it never distracts from the action -- there's a punch-up, shootout or chase at least once every reel. The actors don't have much to work with as the characters are types instead of flesh-out characterizations but they all acquit themselves nicely: Bronson carries the film in usual stoic fashion but there is also nice support work from Martin Balsam as a vengeance-driven mob boss, Ralph Waite as an unapologetically racist cop and Paul Koslo as a creepy jazz-loving assassin. Winner orchestrates the mayhem in a no-nonsense fashion, maintaining a taut pace that keeps the complex narrative in focus and hammering home the action sequences with bone-breaking ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lan. Ultimately, The Stone Killer won't convert anyone who doesn't already enjoy pulp-style action flicks but fans will find plenty of fast-paced carnage to enjoy here. It's definitely one of the best Bronson-Winner team-ups.\n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DadDMaacb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DadDMaacb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DADDnaACB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DADDnaACB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dadDPaacB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dadDPaacB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EADDAaacB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EADDAaacB&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name:..........
