Album features Annie on vocals, electric guitar and lap steel and Peter on vocals, electric guitar, baritone guitar and bass, percussion and programming.\n\nHat Check Girl is a collaboration between the two, but it is also a departure from what either has done before. Yes, Gallup brings her breathy spoken vocals to some songs, and it works beautifully, And yes, Gallway brings some soulful vocals and bluesy hooks in places, and that also works well. But the first thing to know is that this is an electric album. The liner notes assure me that there are acoustic instruments here, even a mandolin, but the mix blends it all and creates electrified textures. The effect is something like the solo work of either Daniel Lanois or Robbie Robertson. Gallup and Gallway between them play six different kinds of guitars, and these guitars sing or hum along with the vocals, or they play intricate rhythmic patterns. Drums are sometimes programmed, sometimes real, and there is bass, and washes of sound from the keyboards. Music this finely crafted can sometimes sound emotionless, but the effect here is intimate, and filled with simmering passion. Tenderness is an excellent title for this album.\n\n&quot;Resolve to be tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant with the weak and wrong. Sometime in your life, you will have been all of these.&quot; \n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/hat-check-girl/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/hat-check-girl/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9a0119efbf1a8a314321d4e840ff6143f589f51","amp;dn":"Hat+Check+Girl...Tenderness%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9a0119efbf1a8a314321d4e840ff6143f589f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,160,17,158,251,241,168,163,20,50,29,78,132,15,246,20,63,88,159,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
