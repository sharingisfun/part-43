Because the Beatles from 1963-1965 (which is the span of this compilation) were putting stuff out in a singles era, some of these &quot;stray&quot; tracks are of exceptional quality and of the utmost importance to the band's history.\nLove Me Do (a different version than the one on Please Please Me), From Me To You, She Loves You, I Want To Hold Your Hand, Long Tall Sally, I Feel Fine, Yes It Is, and I'm Down are key Beatles tracks. If you have an essentials-only policy, then the Red Album is sufficient for you. For those that own all the Beatles' regular albums, there's no reason not to have this too, it fills in a lot of gaps. \n\nThis CD was made to help the fans by cleaning up the band's catalogue, and it succeeded in doing so. So be aware that it is not a Greatest Hits of the early years, that there are tracks (for example the unneccessary inclusion of the German numbers) that keep this from getting a 5th star and making this album for Beatles fans (and not casual fans who'd be better served with the Red Album). \n\nby &quot;bman20k&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\nDisc 1:\n01 - Love Me Do.wma                                              \n02 - From Me To You.wma                                          \n03 - Thank You Girl.wma                                          \n04 - She Loves You.wma                                           \n05 - I'll Get You.wma                                            \n06 - I Want To Hold Your Hand.wma                                \n07 - This Boy.wma                                                \n08 - Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand.wma                                \n09 - Sie Liebt Dich.wma                                          \n10 - Long Tall Sally.wma                                         \n11 - I Call Your Name.wma                                        \n12 - Slow Down.wma                                               \n13 - Matchbox.wma                                                \n14 - I Feel Fine.wma                                             \n15 - She's A Woman.wma                                           \n16 - Bad Boy.wma                                                 \n17 - Yes It Is.wma                                               \n18 - I'm Down.wma   \n\nDisc 2:\n01 - Day Tripper.wma                                             \n02 - We Can Work It Out.wma                                      \n03 - Paperback Writer.wma                                        \n04 - Rain.wma                                                    \n05 - Lady Madonna.wma                                            \n06 - The Inner Light.wma                                         \n07 - Hey Jude.wma                                                \n08 - Revolution.wma                                              \n09 - Get Back.wma                                                \n10 - Don't Let Me Down.wma                                       \n11 - The Ballad Of John And Yoko.wma                             \n12 - Old Brown Shoe.wma                                          \n13 - Across The Universe.wma                                     \n14 - Let It Be.wma                                               \n15 - You Know My Name (Look Up The Number).wma   \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\t\t\n\nFOLLOW ME ON FACEBOOK PAGES: MARCELODRGZTPB\n\nATTENTION: I will read comments on all the material shared only on my Facebook page (MARCELODRGZTPB).
