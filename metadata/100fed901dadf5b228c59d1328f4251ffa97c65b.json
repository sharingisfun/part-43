While her previous outing, Rejoice, saw the Welsh mezzo-soprano striking out more than ever towards the world of pop, Sacred Arias, as the title suggests, sees her return to her religious-classical roots with comfortably familiar tunes like &quot;Abide with Me&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; and even &quot;Silent Night&quot;. The mood on Sacred Arias is as refined and peaceful as you'd expect given the title, and though there's an abundance of well known material here, Jenkins also offers us the more obscure charms of &quot;Missa Criolla&quot;, a dreamy version of Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah&quot; and a soulful take on &quot;Down in the River to Pray&quot;. Other classical pieces include &quot;Panis Angelicus&quot; and Barber's haunting vocal piece &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;, which help make this a triumphant final flourish for both her and Universal. --Danny McKenna\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Abide With Me\n[02] Pie Jesu\t\t\t\t\t- Katherine Jenkins Featuring Steffan Hughes\n[03] The Lord is My Shepherd\n[04] Down In The River To Pray\t\t\t- Katherine Jenkins Featuring Crouch End Festival Chorus\n[05] May The Good Lord Bless And Keep You\n[06] Hallelujah\n[07] Panis Angelicus\n[08] In Paradisum\n[09] Silent Night\n[10] Ave Maria\n[11] Misa Criolla: Kyrie\t\t\t\t- Katherine Jenkins Featuring Crouch End Festival Chorus\n[12] Agnus Dei\t\t\t\t\t- Katherine Jenkins Featuring The  Rodolfus Choir\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:48m:17s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 120mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Classical\n\nOriginally Released\t- 20 October 2008\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Universal Music\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.katherinejenkins.co.uk \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/KJofficial \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/KatherineJenkins \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:100fed901dadf5b228c59d1328f4251ffa97c65b","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+Sacred+Arias+-+Katherine+Jenkins+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"100fed901dadf5b228c59d1328f4251ffa97c65b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,15,237,144,29,173,245,178,40,197,157,19,40,244,37,31,250,151,198,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
