Born in Athens, Greece, as Thomas Lee Bass on March 10, 1962, his family moved to California a year after his birth. Lee received his first drum set at the ripe old age of four, but didn't receive his first real kit until reaching his teenage years, upon his discovery of hard rock and heavy metal (Deep Purple, Kiss, Led Zeppelin, etc.). After drumming for his high-school marching band, Lee quit high school in his senior year, as he focused entirely on following his dream of joining a rock band. His first real band was called Suite 19, and played the Sunset Strip in L.A. during the early '80s. It was at a Suite 19 show that Lee bumped into his future bandmate, Nikki Sixx. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Afterglow\n02.Hold Me Down\n03.Body Architects\n04.Ashamed\n05.Fame 02\n06.Blue\n07.Sunday\n08.Why Is It\n09.Face To Face\n10.Higher\n11.People So Strange\n12.Mr. Shitty\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a9b7b5a29a6b68e7d289b1e7273b3283bcd2cb7","amp;dn":"Tommy+Lee+-+Never+A+Dull+Moment+%282002%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a9b7b5a29a6b68e7d289b1e7273b3283bcd2cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,155,123,90,41,166,182,142,125,40,155,30,114,115,179,40,59,205,44,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
