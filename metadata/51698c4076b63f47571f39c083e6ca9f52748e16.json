Jom means courage, dignity, respect ... It is the origin of all virtues.&quot; A griot travels exuberantly through time and Senegal's collective memory to capture situations linked only by their common concern with the concepts of honour and dignity, the importance of keeping one's word and not being bought or corrupted. To celebrate the concept, Samb uses the griot as the nexus of multiple stories contained in Senegal's collective memory.\n\nTo inspire striking workers, the griot tells of a legendary prince, Dieri Dior Ndella, who sacrificed his life during colonialism, and Koura Thiaw, an entertainer who took up the cause of oppressed domestics in the 1940s, both becoming heroes to their people. Though this strangely lyrical film deals with a contemporary crisis, critic Roy Armes notes that &quot;the film travels exuberantly through time to capture situations linked only by their common concern with the concepts of honor and dignity, the importance of keeping one's word and not being bought or corrupted.&quot; \n\n\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Codec: XviD\nVÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­deo Bitrate: 2.431 Kbps\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½udio Bitrate: 115 kbps 48 KHz\nResolution: 720 x 448\nAspect Ratio: 1.607\nScreen format: Widescreen (16x9)\nFrame Rate: 29.970 FPS\nSize: 1.177 GiB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51698c4076b63f47571f39c083e6ca9f52748e16","amp;dn":"Ababacar+Samb-Makharam+-+Jom+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51698c4076b63f47571f39c083e6ca9f52748e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,105,140,64,118,182,63,71,87,31,57,192,131,230,202,159,82,116,142,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
