This was the first KOF to allow free choice of team members and it introduced Iori Yagami, one of the series' signature characters. \n\nGraphically speaking this is a classic 2D fighter with sprite graphics. While a far cry from the amazing visuals of modern games, the fighters still have style and character, and the backgrounds are engaging without being distracting. The music is played directly from the game disk; you can listen to the tracks from your CD player if you want. \n\nIn terms of gameplay '95 has all the depth you'd expect from a KOF title, although it's not quite as complex as some of the later games in the series. For classic 2D fighter gameplay, though, KOF '95 is a sterling title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3128c39283337e3d4874eb83e3153057f2551a","amp;dn":"%5BPSP-PSX%5DKing+Of+Fighters+95%28NTSC-U%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3128c39283337e3d4874eb83e3153057f2551a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,49,40,195,146,131,51,126,61,72,116,235,131,227,21,48,87,242,85,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
