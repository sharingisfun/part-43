Using a concept called arbitrage, they made their fortunes mainly on minute shifts in stocks being sold on the Nikkei, the Japanese stock market, collapsing banks and nearly bankrupting the Japanese economy in the process. Other schemes were also concocted, most of which were technically legal, though certainly unethical. This true story revolves around &quot;John Malcolm,&quot; who, in exchange for anonymity, agreed to give Ben Mezrich all the access and information he needed to write this book. As a recent Princeton graduate in the mid-1990s, Malcolm accepted an undefined job offer from an American expatriate in Japan to work in the investments field. Though he had no prior experience, he facilitated 25 million dollars worth of trades on his first day on the job, and it just got more exciting from there. He soon joined a small group of expatriates, all in their twenties and mostly Ivy League graduates, who lived like rock stars, thriving on the stress and excitement of their jobs to create their own steroid versions of the American Dream half a world away. Mezrich tells this riveting story well, incorporating elements of the culture into his narrative, including the infamous and pervasive Japanese &quot;Water Trade,&quot; or sex business, romantic intrigue, and even run-ins with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Though there is little real analysis of their financial dealings and how they ultimately changed the rules of finance in Asia, this entertaining page turner does offer a glimpse into a world little explored in print until now..\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\nThough the names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent, this is a true story, containing all the ingredients of a great narrativeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a main character the reader can relate to, an appealing love interest, money, danger, the need for acceptance, suspense and even the realization (in some form) of the American dream. Mezrich (Bringing Down the House) presents wanna-be financial star &quot;John Malcolm,&quot; who accepts a nebulous job offer in Japan in the mid-1990s and leaves his middle-class New Jersey postcollege aimless existence for an adventure he might have dreamed of had he any idea of what the big boys' world of finance was really like. After hitting the ground at top speed from day one, John and his cohortsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all male, mostly Ivy League graduatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½learn their way around the lucrative, fast-paced and legal-but-barely-palatable world of cowboy-style Asian market finance. In the process, they make millions (sometimes per trade) and pride themselves on knowing when to get in and how to spot their exit point. Their bottom line is all that matters; everything elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from emotion to opinionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is secondary. In a truly engaging look at how an innocent who thinks he knows the world does actually end up understanding a small but significant piece of it, Mezrich manages to incorporate solid journalism into a narrative that just plain works.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d1acc0c61a9955a769d5a7a79fa3b2a992e363","amp;dn":"Ugly+Americans%3A+The+True+Story+of+the+Ivy+League+Cowboys+Who+Rai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d1acc0c61a9955a769d5a7a79fa3b2a992e363","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,209,172,192,198,26,153,85,167,105,213,167,167,159,163,178,169,146,227,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
