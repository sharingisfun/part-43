His family moved west to Phoenix, Arizona, in the early Fifties, where Duane met his longtime partner, co-writer and producer, Lee Hazlewood. Together, they created a successful formula based upon DuaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unique approach to the guitar, and LeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experimental vision in the recording studio.\n\nEddy introduced a unique, twangy sound to Rock and Roll guitar. As John Fogerty wrote in Rolling Stone about his style; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was one of those untouchable, unique thingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Duane Eddy was the front guy, the first rock &amp; roll guitar god.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Combining strong, dramatic, single-note melodies, the bending of the low strings, and a combination of echo, vibrato bar (Bigsby), and tremolo, he produced a signature sound that was unlike anything yet heard - the sound that would be featured on an unprecedented string of thirty-four chart singles, fifteen of which made the top forty and sales of over 100 million worldwide. Later in his career, Eddy was interviewed by John Fogerty for Musician magazine about his style. Fogerty called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½bigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ both in a sense of it being new and the actual sound quality itself. Eddy told Fogerty, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI knew we had to have something bigÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ We did go for a big sound. I have to give a lot of credit to Lee Hazlewood. He mixed things for AM radio in those days so that they would come rockin out of the radio.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n[duane eddy-18 Greatest Hits (Re-recordings) [Extra tracks, Import]\n\n1.Dance With the Guitar Man\n2.Peter Gunn\n3.Because They're Young\n4.Some Kinda Earthquake\n5.Theme from Dixie\n6.Shazam!\n7.Kommotion\n8.Trombone\n9.Bonnie Came Back\n10.detour\n11.
