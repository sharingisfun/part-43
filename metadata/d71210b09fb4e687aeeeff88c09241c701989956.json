Post any questions you may have as comments, and I'll get back to you pretty much instantly)\n\n[NOTE: I'm thinking that you will have to use the magnet URL to download it...seeing as there was no tracker to add to the tracker list when I made the torrent file...]\n\n[NOTE: I URGE YOU TO SEED THIS FILE TO A 7.0 SHARE RATIO WHEN YOU ARE DONE! I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY PERSON SEEDING THIS...ALSO, MY COMPUTER KEEPS BLUE SCREENING, SO YOUR DOWNLOAD MAY BE INTERRUPTED, BUT I WILL TRY TO RESTART AS SOON AS POSSIBLE]\n\n\nHow to 'install': Extract to a folder that you wish, and than double click &quot;Play.exe&quot; that is in the Killing Floor folder...DO NOT RUN FROM Killing Floor|System|killingfloor.exe, as that would be the equivalent to running the game without the crack... Do NOT forget to change your players name in the REV.INI file (Killing Floor)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71210b09fb4e687aeeeff88c09241c701989956","amp;dn":"Killing+Floor+v1011+Precracked+%28NO+STEAM%29+%2B+Maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d71210b09fb4e687aeeeff88c09241c701989956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,18,16,176,159,180,230,135,174,238,255,136,192,146,65,199,1,152,153,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
