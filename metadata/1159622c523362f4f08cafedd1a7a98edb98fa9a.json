They are not 'remasters' (such as the circulating 24-bit remasters) nor remixes (good for our friend Legs). They seem straight transfers of either excellent early vinyl editions of these albums, or possibly (as I've heard) the cassettes or 8-tracks, which I'm not sure I believe.There are also British LP versions from Ebbetts straight from those wonderful Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab releases back in the early 80's. Now, in theory, since vinyl (analog)albums almost always sound better than (digital) CDs, then these discs should be superb, right? Well...sometimes. The problem is, especially with the Capitol versions, what you got on record wasn't great quality to begin with.
