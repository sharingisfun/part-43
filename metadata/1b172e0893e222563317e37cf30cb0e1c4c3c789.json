Warwick Davis stars in the film, as well as Val Kilmer, Joanne Whalley, Jean Marsh and Patricia Hayes. With a sword and sorcery setting, Davis stars as the eponymous lead character and hero Willow, a reluctant dwarf who plays a critical role in protecting a special baby from a tyrannical queen.\n\nIn the dungeons of the castle of the evil Queen-sorceress Bavmorda, a prisoner gives birth to a child who, according to an ancient prophecy, will put an end to the reign of the Queen. A midwife saves the child from the wrath of Bavmorda, but is forced to throw her cradle in a river when reached by the Hounds of the Queen. The river brings the child near a village of nelwyns, and little Willow finds and adopts her. When the Hounds reach the village, Willow begins a difficult journey to bring the baby back to her people and to fulfill the prophecy. \n\n\nLanguage: English 5.1\n\nSubs:     English, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, \n          English For The Hearing Impaired\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nWidescreen 16:9\nPAL\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b172e0893e222563317e37cf30cb0e1c4c3c789","amp;dn":"Willow+%281988%29++DVD-R++PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b172e0893e222563317e37cf30cb0e1c4c3c789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,23,46,8,147,226,34,86,51,23,227,124,243,12,176,225,196,195,199,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
