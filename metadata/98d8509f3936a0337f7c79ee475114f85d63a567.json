I haven't done enough research to determine whether these are the first Japanese masterings or the later &quot;silent remasters&quot; that Bob Ludwig did a bit later or something else altogether, but it's been determined that these masterings have been available on earlier pressings. And it does not include the 2005 30th Anniversary remaster of Born to Run or the 2010 remaster of Darkness on the Edge of Town (the peak values both match earlier CD pressings).\n\nFor what it's worth, here are the mastering credits included in the booklet:\n\nGREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK, N.J.\nMastering Engineer: Bob Ludwig (Remastering Engineer) / Brian Lee (Remastering Engineer)\n\nBORN TO RUN\nMastering Engineer: Greg Calbi (all tracks except 5)\n\nDARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN\nMastering Engineer: Mike Reese\n\nBORN IN THE U.S.A.\nMastering Engineer: Bob Ludwig / Brian Lee (Remastering Engineer) / Bob Ludwig (Remastering Engineer)\n\nThe other albums have no mastering credits.\n\nEither way, these CDs sound fine, but Bruce's recordings have never been audiophile quality. I prefer the way some of these songs sound on the Bob Ludwig-mastered Essential Bruce Springsteen from 2003 (to my ears, the 2003 masterings sound a bit fuller). But this is still a really nice set and a great way to dig into early Springsteen.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98d8509f3936a0337f7c79ee475114f85d63a567","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+The+Collection+1973-84+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98d8509f3936a0337f7c79ee475114f85d63a567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,216,80,159,57,54,160,51,127,124,121,238,71,81,20,248,93,99,165,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
