Stick to his lusty voice-and-piano escapades, because when he pulls out the stops waves of funereal or giddy schmaltz spew forth. -- Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Frank John Hadley 1993\n\nRichie Unterberger, All Music Guide\nLike Slim's other Bluesville work, this is a characteristic and very consistent effort, though not what you would single out as the cream of his recorded work. He varies the program between originals and covers of standards like &quot;Mean Mistreatin' Mama,&quot; &quot;Rock Me Baby,&quot; and &quot;Goin' Down Slow,&quot; providing a touch of unpredictability by switching from the piano to the organ on a few tracks.\n\n\ntrack list: \n\n01.
