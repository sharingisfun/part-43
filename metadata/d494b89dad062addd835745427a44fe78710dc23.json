The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\nIn the meantime, they developed a prototype for power ballads with &quot;Dream On,&quot; a piano ballad that was orchestrated with strings and distorted guitars. Aerosmith's ability to pull off both ballads and rock &amp; roll made them extremely popular during the mid-'70s, when they had a string of gold and platinum albums. By the early '80s, the group's audience had declined as the band fell prey to drug and alcohol abuse. However, their career was far from over -- in the late '80s, Aerosmith pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in rock history, returning to the top of the charts with a group of albums that equalled, if not surpassed, the popularity of their '70s albums.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\nRock in a Hard Place is the sound of Aerosmith at their most &quot;out of it.&quot; Not to say it's a horrible album by any means -- in fact, there are more than a few pleasant surprises -- but without the guitar team of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, it didn't possess the magical chemistry of their '70s classics. Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay filled in for the departed duo, and it turned out to be the group's most studio-enhanced and experimental record up to this point. To keep up with the then-current musical climate, vocoders and synthesizers can be subtly detected, as heard on the space-age &quot;Prelude to Joanie&quot; and in the beginning to the otherwise tough rocker &quot;Lightning Strikes,&quot; which served as the album's lone single/video. &quot;Jailbait,&quot; &quot;Bitch's Brew,&quot; &quot;Bolivian Ragamuffin,&quot; and the title track showed the band could still rock out despite their three-year layoff between albums, a cover of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; showed their gentle side, while the psychedelicized &quot;Joanie's Butterfly&quot; was the album's surprise highlight. But it didn't take an expert to know that Aerosmith was not the same after the loss of the aforementioned members. And so did the band, who welcomed Perry and Whitford back into its ranks two years after Rock in a Hard Place.\n\n01.Jailbait\n02.Lightning Strikes\n03.Bitch's Brew\n04.Bolivian Ragamuffin\n05.Cry Me A River\n06.Prelude To Joanie\n07.Joanie's Butterfly\n08.Rock In A Hard Place (Cheshire Cat)\n09.Jig Is Up\n10.Push Comes To Shove\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d494b89dad062addd835745427a44fe78710dc23","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Rock+In+A+Hard+Place+%281982%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d494b89dad062addd835745427a44fe78710dc23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,148,184,157,173,6,42,221,216,53,116,84,39,164,79,231,135,16,220,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
