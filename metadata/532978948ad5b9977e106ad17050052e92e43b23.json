Even Le Monde, the newspaper of the French elite, proclaimed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe are all Americans.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBy now, however, the goodwill is long gone, eradicated by bad feelings over the Iraq war, Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, global warming and a host of other disagreements.\n\nBut long before George W. Bush became President, Europeans had very strong (and often negative) opinions about American culture and politics.\n\nThe Anti-Americans (a hate/love relationship) examines the complicated mixture of envy, pride, admiration, and cultural misunderstanding that characterizes European views.  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a situation that has led some commentators to say that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmericans are from Mars, Europeans are from Venus.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis film examines the current status of European attitudes towards America in three very different places: France, the United Kingdom and Poland.  Freely mixing humor with provocative commentary, the program shows how Old World attitudes can be both nuanced and simplistic at the same time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sometimes contradictory, sometimes predictable, but always worthy of our interest. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/weta/crossroads/about/show_anti-americans.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/weta/crossroads/about/show_anti-americans.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED.
