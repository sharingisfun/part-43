It's an age-old question that was relatively    \n         &quot;taboo&quot; in mainstream science until the mid-1990s, when       \n         astronomers found planets outside our solar system. Now,      \n         Known Universe joins the hunt for alien life as scientists    \n         search for planets with similar characteristics to            \n         Earth's. We'll take you on a journey to find planets that     \n         may support life and show you new space-based technologies    \n          that aid in the search for advanced alien civilizations.      \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n         Hybrid. about 80% video and 20% film so as always i blended   \n          the film parts to video rate.                                 \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
