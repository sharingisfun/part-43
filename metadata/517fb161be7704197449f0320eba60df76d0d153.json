This movie was written, directed and produced by Brian Clemens of the British television cult series &quot;The Avengers.&quot; It has a strong Western motif which Brian Clemens admits was his goal. In addition to his other peculiarities Captain Kronos smokes pot which he describes as a herb from the orient. This movie was an attempt by the financially ailing Hammer Studio to try a different direction in their style of movies which by the early seventies had become predictable with diminishing audiences. There was only so many times Dracula could return from the dead and again be sent back. Brian Clemens was a hired gun brought in to inject something different into the formulaic Hammer line of movies. The outcome of this was a quirky mystery tale involving a different kind of vampire slayer.\n\nThe story starts out with the mysterious deaths of young women in a remote section of the English countryside. A Dr. Marcos(John Garson) who had come across one of the dead girls left strangely aged sends for a former military friend of his to investigate these killings. Captain Kronos(Horst Janson) shows up riding a white horse with his sidekick, a hunchback named Professor Grost(John Cater) traveling in a horse drawn buggy. With them is a beautiful village girl named Carla(Caroline Munro) that Kronos had freed in a neighboring village from a stockade. Now this odd crew sets about trying to find out who this unknown vampire-like killer could be. This is not a vampire that most people have heard about, but a different species that drains its' victims of their youth, not their blood. \n\n------- SCREENSHOTS --------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaeliAaDk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AaeliAaDk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAELJaAdK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAELJaAdK&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile Name ..........: Captain.Kronos-Vampire.Hunter.1974.DivX-NvadR.avi\nFile Info ..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071276/\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 734,468,524 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 717,254 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 700.44 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 657,864,304 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 642,446 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 627.39 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:31:11\nVideo Codec Code ...: DX50/divx\nVideo Codec Name ...: DivX 5.0 codec\nVideo Passes .......: 6 Pass\nVideo Bitrate ......: 961 KB/s\nResolution .........: 720 x 400\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.80:1\nTotal Frames .......: 131171 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 23.976 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 24 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0.139 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: Yes\n\nAudio Language .....: English\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 76,594,000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 74,799 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 73.05 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:31:11\nAudio Codec Code ...: 8192 (0x2000)\nAudio Codec Name ...: (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 112 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\nNO SUBS\n\n-------- TORRENT STATS REAL TIME -------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/f032/12e4fae28.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/f032/12e4fae28.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:517fb161be7704197449f0320eba60df76d0d153","amp;dn":"Captain+Kronos-Vampire+Hunter+1974+DivX-NvadR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"517fb161be7704197449f0320eba60df76d0d153","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,127,177,97,190,119,4,25,116,73,240,50,14,186,96,223,118,208,209,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
