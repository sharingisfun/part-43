Same actors, and likely the same storyline as &quot;nekem lampast adott az ur,pesten&quot;, but its really the best movie what i had ever seen. It's doesn't include any computer graphic, or expensive and famous artist, but Jancso's absurdity makes this movie one of the best hungarian movie ever.\n\nThe story is so simple : Child of Kapa appears, and wants the grandfather's fake money. After Kapa gets into the invisible wall, he kills his son, and doesn't feel any sorrow, but he blinds.\n\nJancso compresses all of his experience into his masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b18fac5cb019ef4698c0135ecabf0ec5312425b","amp;dn":"Anyad%21+A+Szunyogok+-+Mikl%C3%83%C2%B3s+Jancs%C3%83%C2%B3+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b18fac5cb019ef4698c0135ecabf0ec5312425b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,24,250,197,203,1,158,244,105,140,1,53,236,171,240,236,83,18,66,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
