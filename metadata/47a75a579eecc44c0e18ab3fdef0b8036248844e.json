The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.\n\nA normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.\n\n&quot;Kids in America&quot; is a New Wave song by British singer Kim Wilde, released in the United Kingdom as her debut single in January 1981, and in the US in 1982. The song peaked at number two on the UK singles chart. The following year it became a Top 30 hit in the US. In the summer of 1981, the track appeared on Wilde's self-titled debut album.\n\nThe song was recorded in 1980 after RAK Records boss Mickie Most heard Wilde singing on a backing track for her brother Ricky Wilde. He liked her voice and image and expressed an interest to work with her. Ricky Wilde, together with his father Marty Wilde (who is a 1950s/1960s rock and roll star) wrote the song &quot;Kids in America&quot; for Wilde to record. Once the demo was sent, Most remixed the track himself and released it on RAK as Wilde's first single in January 1981.\n(video has a mostly-transparent white &quot;BR&quot; logo at the top left)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_America_(Kim_Wilde_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_in_America_(Kim_Wilde_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaeIEaadc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaeIEaadc&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:15\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
