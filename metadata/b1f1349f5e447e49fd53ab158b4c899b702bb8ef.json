Its protagonists were the two mightiest capital ships of the era - the German battleship Bismarck and the British battle cruiser Hood. Their confrontation resulted in the destruction of both warships and the loss of over 3,500 lives. In 2001 - the 60th anniversary of this apocalyptic battle - David Mearns led an expedition that discovered the wreck of Hood for the very first time and revisited the wreck of Bismarck. As well as tracing the history of these awe-inspiring vessels and the events that led to their fatal clash, this two-part documentary chronicles the progress of this mission.\n\nPart 2 Sink the Bismarck!\nAfter the loss of HMS Hood . Britain is in a state of shock, its capital ship sunk by just one shell. Churchill has ordered every British warship or plane within striking distance to 'Sink the Bismarck!'. This second feature-length documentary reveals the expedition's findings about Hitler's dreaded battleship - the most powerful weapon of its day - and her historic first, and last, voyage.\n\nCh4 Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-battle-of-hood-and-bismarck&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-battle-of-hood-and-bismarck&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 3400 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 76mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 1.91 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nA smaller x264/mkv and SRT are available from MVGroup.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1f1349f5e447e49fd53ab158b4c899b702bb8ef","amp;dn":"Ch4+The+Battle+of+Hood+and+Bismark+2of2+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGroup+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1f1349f5e447e49fd53ab158b4c899b702bb8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,241,52,159,94,68,126,73,253,83,171,21,139,76,137,155,112,43,184,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
