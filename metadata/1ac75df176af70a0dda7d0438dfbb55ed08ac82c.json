The application not only includes support for extracting virtually any kind of file compression format, it also boasts a no-nonsense approach to reducing file sizes.Boasting more compression options, higher compression rates and smaller file sizes than WinZip, WinRAR is now the undisputed market leader in file compression.\n\nx32 and x64 bit versions included!\n\n===============\nWiNRAR Features\n===============\n\n* WinRAR introduces an original compression algorithm. It provides\nhigh compression ratios on executable files, object libraries,\nlarge text files, etc.\n\n* WinRAR offers an optional compression algorithm highly optimized\nfor multimedia data.\n\n* WinRAR supports files and archives up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807\nbytes in size, about 9000PB. The number of archived files is unlimited\nfor all practical purposes.\n\n* WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP 2.0 archives\nand is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR,\nISO, Z, 7Z archives.\n\n* WinRAR supports NTFS file security and data streams.\n\n* WinRAR offers both a classic interactive Windows interface\nand the command line interface.\n\n* WinRAR provides functionality for creating a 'solid' archive,\nwhich can raise the compression ratio by 10% - 50% over more common\nmethods, particularly when packing large numbers of small files.\n\n* WinRAR offers the ability to create and change SFX archives using\ndefault and external SFX modules.\n\n* WinRAR offers the ability to create a multi-volume archive as SFX.\n\n* WinRAR offers a number of service functions, such as setting a\npassword, adding archive and file comments. Even physically\ndamaged archives may be repaired and an archive may be locked\nto prevent further changes.\n\n====================================\nNew Features of Professional Edition\n====================================\n\n1. WinRAR version for Windows x64 is available. If you use\nWindows x64, it is strongly recommended to install 64 bit\nWinRAR version. It provides a higher performance and better\nshell integration than 32 bit version.\n\n2. RAR compression speed is improved for multi-core\nand multi-CPU systems. This improvement is most noticeable\nin Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems.\n\n3. &quot;Remove duplicate folders from extraction path&quot; option\nin &quot;Settings/Compression&quot; dialog is replaced by more universal\n&quot;Remove redundant folders from extraction path&quot; option.\nThis option will eliminate redundant archive name based folders\nfrom extraction path if you unpack an archive with\n&quot;Extract to DestName&quot; context menu command and if archive\nroot folder contains only one folder and no files.\n\n4. Changes in &quot;Extraction path and options&quot; dialog:\n\na) &quot;New folder&quot; button creates a new subfolder in currently\nselected folder;\n\nb) F2 key renames a selected folder in the folders tree;\n\nc) F5 key updated the tree pane contents;\n\nd) Del key removes a selected folder in the folders tree.\n\n5. You can enable &quot;Show seconds&quot; option in &quot;Settings/File list&quot;\ndialog if you wish to see seconds in file dates in file list\nin WinRAR shell.\n\n6. &quot;Where to check for SFX archives&quot; options group\nin &quot;Settings/Integration/Context menus items&quot; dialog lets\nyou to control processing of SFX archives in context menus.\nFor example, if you frequently right click &quot;.exe&quot; files\non slow network disks, you can turn off &quot;Network disks&quot; options\nto minimize the delay before displaying the context menu.\n\n7. If you sort files by name in the file list in WinRAR shell,\nWinRAR will use the new logical file name sorting,\nsame as in Windows Explorer, considering digits in file names\nby their numerical value. So files will be sorted as\n1.txt, 2.txt, 10.txt instead of previous 1.txt, 10.txt, 2.txt.\nThis new sort behavior is available in Windows XP Service Pack 2\nand newer.\n\n8. Ctrl+W key combination can be used to close the main WinRAR window\nalso as WinRAR viewer windows. &quot;View as Windows text&quot; shortcut\nin WinRAR viewer changed from Ctrl+W to Ctrl+I.\n\n9. New command line switch -r- disables recursion completely.\nSo 'rar a -r- arc dirname' command will add only the empty\ndirname folder and ignore its contents. By default, if dirname\ndoes not include wildcards, RAR adds its contents even if\n-r switch is not specified.\n\n10. If used when extracting, the new command line switch -ai forces\nRAR to ignore file attributes. When using this switch,\nextracted files will always have attributes assigned by\noperating system to a newly created file by default.\n\n11. If output file name is not specified in &quot;cw&quot; command, console RAR\nwill send comment data to stdout.\n\n12. When compressing stdin data with -si[name] switch, RAR sets\nmodification time of archived entry to current system time.\nPrevious RAR versions did not fill this field, resulting in\nmeaningless modification time for stdin.\n\n13. Message displayed when you place the mouse cursor on WinRAR\ntray icon includes the archive name now. Previously only\ntime left and total percent were displayed for archiving operations.\n\n14. New 'Shutdown' variable in 'SoftwareWinRARPolicy' registry key\nallows to disable &quot;Turn PC off when done&quot; option for security reasons.\nRead &quot;Configuration settings/Registry variables&quot; for more details.\n\n15. Better shell extension performance. Now WinRAR context menu will be\nmore responsive when working with thousands of selected files.\n\n16. Improved compatibility with high DPI Windows display mode.\n\n17. Bugs fixed:\n\na) WinRAR could fail to open tar or tar.gz archive if such archive\ncontained a file larger than 8 GB;\n\nb) WinRAR context menu did not work properly in Windows 7 beta\nif icons in context menus were enabled and user clicked\na file inside of Windows 7 Library folder;\n\nc) previous WinRAR versions failed to rename files having 5 or more\ncontinuous spaces in the name. WinRAR shell does not display\nsuch spaces for safety reasons, because they can hide an actual\nfile extension. But this security measure prevented the rename\ncommand to work properly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac75df176af70a0dda7d0438dfbb55ed08ac82c","amp;dn":"WinRAR.3.90.Pro.%28x32%2Cx64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac75df176af70a0dda7d0438dfbb55ed08ac82c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,199,93,241,118,175,112,160,221,167,208,67,141,251,181,94,208,138,200,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
