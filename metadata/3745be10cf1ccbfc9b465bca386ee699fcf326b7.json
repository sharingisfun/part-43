Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) may lack in the skills that their chieftain is looking for, but they have plans to make it big. Zed has a gut feeling that God has &quot;chosen&quot; him, and so he leads his buddy on a trip through the unknown countryside in search of bigger and better things, bumping into several weird characters along the way -- like a feuding pair of brothers named Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd). Unfortunately, their quest for greatness hits a few snags, like being sold into slavery, and later becoming the object of interest to a very amorous, very hairy high priest (Oliver Platt) in the opulent city of Sodom.\n\nStarring:\nJack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Vinnie Jones, Hank Azaria, Juno Temple, Olivia Wilde, June Diane Raphael, Xander Berkeley, \nGia Carides, Horatio Sanz, David Pasquesi, Matthew Willig\n\n[/b][/i]\n[img]http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/Articles/Sources/Kiss_DP-1000/Images/divX_logo.gif[/img][img]http://www.fashionfunky.com/upload/2008/04/03/Dolby_LOGO_Gold_Dolby_Digital.jpg[/img]\n[/center]\n\n\n[font=Courier New]\nYear.One[2009]DVDRip[AC3][En]DivX-Ch4cal.avi\n\n__________________\nMOVIE INFORMATION\n__________________\n\nTITLE.............: Year One\nDIRECTOR..........: Harold Ramis\nWRITER............: Harold Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky\nYEAR..............: 2009\nRUNTIME...........: 01:39\nIMDB RATE.........: 5.1/10 (10,808)\nGENRE.............: Adventure, Comedy\nCOUNTRY...........: USA\nSOURCE............: NTSC DVD9 - Courtesy of djfred http://torrentbucket.com/\nSIZE..............: 803MB\nSIZE ON DISK......: 823,570KB\nFORMAT............: DivX Home Theater certified\nIMDB..............: [url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045778/[/url]\nRelease Date......: 26 June 2009 (UK)\nMPAA Rating.......: This is Original version Rated R for some sexual content and language.\n_________________\nVIDEO TRACK\n__________________\n\nCODEC.............: DivX 6.8.5\nRESOLUTION........: 720 x 480\nDAR...............: 16:9\nFRAME RATE........: 23.976fps\nQ.FRAME...........: 0.096\nBITRATE...........: 990Kbps\n\n__________________\nAUDIO TRACK(S)\n__________________\n\nEnglish...........: AC3 48KHz (2 chans @ 128Kbps)\n\n__________________\nSUBTITLE TRACK(S)\n__________________\n\nnone\n__________________\nNOTES\n__________________\n1.
