He plays a little rack harmonica on several numbers, but mostly this is Edwards the Delta bluesman, confident vocalist and down home guitarist on a programme of varied Mississippi blues, and with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Sweet Home ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the only Robert Johnson number in his repertoire for this session. Yes, his style is derivative, but surely that is an integral part of the Blues tradition he represents, one he did indeed learn first-hand. Agreed, this may not be the most dynamic performance there is, but this is a genuine Mississippi born and raised bluesman playing the music he grew up with. As such, it is an important document (pun intended).\n\nTRACK LIST \n01 - Catfish Blues\n02 - Bad Rooster\n03 - Blues, blues\n04 - Sweet Home Chicago\n05 - Keys to the highway\n06 - Bumble Bee\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Louise\n08 - Kansas City\n09 - Drop Down Mama\n10 - I Love You Baby\n11 - Take Me In Your Arms\n12 - When You Get Lonesome\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59c89b835008cbc1543a5f9ac8b896df98ae4d9f","amp;dn":"David+Honeyboy+Edwards+Blues+Blues%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59c89b835008cbc1543a5f9ac8b896df98ae4d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,200,155,131,80,8,203,193,84,58,95,154,200,184,150,223,152,174,77,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
