Windmilling and kerranging from a huge cast of strummers and twangers including Slash, Jeff Beck, Johnny Marr, Pete Townshend, Mick Jones of the Clash, Status Quo and Matt Bellamy of Muse.\n\nDuration:60 minutes\n\nRipped by myself from BBCiPlayer, Protection &amp; Copyright removed!!\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nTam&amp;Carla\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55733a267e552ec7b9c451ea6fb42fd9ca1edbb5","amp;dn":"Im+in+a+Rock+n+Roll+Band+S01E02+-+The+Guitarist_BBCiRip_Tam.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55733a267e552ec7b9c451ea6fb42fd9ca1edbb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,115,58,38,126,85,46,199,185,196,81,234,111,180,47,217,202,30,219,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
