They were active during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe band members included drummer Bill Bateman (also of The Blasters), guitarist Dave Lee, bassist Johnny Ray Bartel (also of The Knitters), guitarist Paul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe KidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Size, and band leader and harmonica player Lester Butler.\n\nKing King ranges from straight-ahead, stick-to-the-formula, stock blues to foreshadowings of Butler's next agglomeration, &quot;13,&quot; mixing blues and alternative rock. Named after and recorded at their favorite haunt, the live recording includes Butler telling his bandmates the next song on the playlist and what key to play in.\n\nThat just about says it all, this is one tight band, now long gone. The foremost soloist is the singer/harp player and he is great but it's not the individuals that stand out here, its the whole, its solid, raw and emotive blues at its best. Comparisons, if you need them, can be drawn to the hoax, without the Stevie Ray Vaughan influence, and that similar intensity to any of the blues greats, it's not original, it's not virtuosic, but it's damn good!!\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBill Bateman - Drums \nDave Lee - Guitar \nJohnny Ray Bartel - Bass \nPaul ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe KidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Size - Guitar\nLester Butler - Harmonica\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
