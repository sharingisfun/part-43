Well it gives you a clear account of one part of the wider First World War front that is only now becoming clear and even possible to study. (Attempts to clear the names of those summarily executed is still politically sensitive in Italy.) But a more important reason is that it offers insights into the conduct of events now. If History has anything to teach, its that we the ordinary people wont get a true picture what our masters have been doing in our name until we are pushing up the daisies.. In knowing what was going on behind closed doors then, we can question what the media, cultural elites, military strategists, politicians are doing now. But of course if you think we have the straight line on the War on Terror, then give it a miss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a56185d1854d191c67024df3263708d25810a55","amp;dn":"The+White+War+Life+and+Death+on+the+Italian+Front+1915-1919","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a56185d1854d191c67024df3263708d25810a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,86,24,93,24,84,209,145,198,112,36,223,50,99,112,141,37,129,10,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
