Jim Winchester's book takes a sweeping look at these aerial disasters in this nicely illustrated, inexpensively priced volume.\n\nIn paging through the 300-odd pages of this book, it's obvious that every nation has had its share of aerial duds, witness the Italian Caproni 'Noviplano,' the French 'Jabiru,' the English Pemberton-Billing 'Nighthawk,' the German Fokker V8 or the American Curtiss XP-62. It's incredible viewing page after page of dead-end designs that make one wonder 'did they really pay someone to design that thing?!'\n\nTo be honest, some of the aircraft in this book do not deserve the &quot;worst of&quot; designation. In some cases, they arrived too late on the aviation scene to be successful, were successful designs brought down by powerplant problems or were built as one-off research designs, etc.\n\nNevertheless, it's great fun to peruse this book and marvel at the incredibly bad designs churned out over the years. Each aircraft is illustrated by two photographs or profiles, many of which are in color.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:520b878409795c5f61155125b67dcd36e870b917","amp;dn":"World%5C%27s+Worst+Aircraft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"520b878409795c5f61155125b67dcd36e870b917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,11,135,132,9,121,92,95,97,21,81,37,182,125,205,54,232,112,185,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
