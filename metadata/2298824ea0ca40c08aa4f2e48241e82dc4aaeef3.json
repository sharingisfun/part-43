Underearners are self-saboteurs who don't live up to their earnings potential, says Barbara Stanny, a financial educator, motivational speaker, and career counselor. Whether they make $10 an hour or six figures a year, they tend to live paycheck to paycheck, are often in debt, and have a high tolerance for low pay. Ironically, many work incredibly hard.\n\n\nThe good news is that underearning is a self-imposed condition. By focusing on overcoming it, underearners will not only earn what they deserve, but live a richer life. With techniques and exercises that have helped thousands of people, Stanny teaches five essential steps to financial independence and brings a message of empowerment to all those who chronically undervalue themselves.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2298824ea0ca40c08aa4f2e48241e82dc4aaeef3","amp;dn":"Overcoming+Underearning%3A+A+Five+Step+Plan+to+a+Richer+Life-Mante","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2298824ea0ca40c08aa4f2e48241e82dc4aaeef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,152,130,78,160,202,64,192,138,164,242,228,130,65,232,45,196,170,238,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
