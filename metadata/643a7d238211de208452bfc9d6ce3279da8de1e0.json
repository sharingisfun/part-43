The band's musical style incorporates classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into hard rock and heavy metal. The orchestra is most famous for their Christmas-themed series of rock operas (Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, and The Lost Christmas Eve), for which they do an annual winter tour. Their other releases are based on historical themes (Beethoven's Last Night and Night Castle). Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which are complete with a full orchestra, a massive light show, lasers, dozens of pyrotechnics, moving trusses, video screens, and other effects that are synchronized to the actual music.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Orchestra is known for their incorporation of classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into rock and heavy metal music. They are listed under many genres, but mostly symphonic rock, progressive rock, neo-classical metal, and classical music. Three of their albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christmas Eve and Other Stories (1996), The Christmas Attic (1998), The Lost Christmas Eve (2004) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are based around Christmas themes. These rock operas, collectively known as the &quot;Christmas trilogy,&quot; remain their best-selling and most famous works.\n\nBoth in the recording studio and live, Trans-Siberian Orchestra uses a full orchestra, choirs, and a constantly growing and changing group of singers and musicians. It was founded and is produced and led by head composer and lyricist Paul O'Neill, alongside composer and vocalist Jon Oliva and guitarist and music director Al Pitrelli (both members of the progressive metal band Savatage), with co-producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Kinkel.\n\nBeethoven's Last Night is a concept album by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, released in 2000. The album tells the fictional story of Ludwig van Beethoven on the last night of his life, as the devil, Mephistopheles, comes to collect his soul. With the help of Fate and her son Twist, Beethoven unwittingly tricks the devil and is allowed to keep his soul which he had thought lost, but that the devil had no claim on. The album is a rock opera featuring many classical crossover rock songs which are clearly based on melodies from classical music, particularly Beethoven's works. It is the first Trans-Siberian Orchestra album that does not feature Christmas themes.\n\n\nTrackList\n\n01 - Overture\n02 - Midnight\n03 - Fate\n04 - What Good This Deafness\n05 - Mephistopheles\n06 - What Is Eternal\n07 - The Moment\n08 - Vienna\n09 - Mozart/Figaro\n10 - The Dreams of Candlelight\n11 - Requiem (The Fifth)\n12 - I'll Keep Your Secrets\n13 - The Dark\n14 - Fur Elise\n15 - After the Fall\n16 - A Last Illusion\n17 - This Is Who You Are\n18 - Beethoven\n19 - Mephistopheles' Return\n20 - Misery\n21 - Who Is This Child\n22 - A Final Dream\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFormato                          : MPEG Audio\nVersione del formato             : Version 1\nProfilo del formato              : Layer 3\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â                          : Costante\nBitRate                          : 320 Kbps\nCanali                           : 2 canali\nSamplingRate                     : 44,1 KHz\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nJoin www.nautilus-bt.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:643a7d238211de208452bfc9d6ce3279da8de1e0","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+Beethoven%5C%27s+Last+Night+%5BMP3+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"643a7d238211de208452bfc9d6ce3279da8de1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,58,125,35,130,17,222,32,132,82,191,201,214,206,50,121,218,141,225,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
