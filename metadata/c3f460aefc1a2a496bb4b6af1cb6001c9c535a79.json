The two aspects of his career were related; Ellington used his band as a musical laboratory for his new compositions and shaped his writing specifically to showcase the talents of his bandmembers, many of whom remained with him for long periods. Ellington also wrote film scores and stage musicals, and several of his instrumental works were adapted into songs that became standards. In addition to touring year in and year out, he recorded extensively, resulting in a gigantic body of work that was still being assessed a quarter century after his death.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tExact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nCue File:\t\tYes\nM3U File:\t\tYes\nLog file:\t\tIncluded In Torrent Description\n\t\t\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tJazz\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel: \t\t\tNewsound\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.What Am I Here For\n02.Raincheck\n03.In A Mellotone\n04.Ko-Ko\n05.Warm Valley\n06.I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)\n07.Perdido\n08.Johnny Come Lately\n09.Main Stem\n10.Bojangles (A Portrait Of Bill Robinson)\n11.Take The 'A' Train\n12.Harlem Air Shaft\n13.Concerto For Cootie\n14.All Too Soon\n15.Chelsea Bridge\n16.Moon-Mist\n17.Jack The Bear\n18.Don't Get Around Much Anymore (Never No Lament)\n\n\n\nNote: I didn't include the log file in the torrent for technical reasons.
