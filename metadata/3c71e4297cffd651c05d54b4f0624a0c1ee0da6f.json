With a vocal range spanning three octaves (Db3 to Db6), she was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing and intonation, and a &quot;horn-like&quot; improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing. She is considered to be a notable interpreter of the Great American Songbook.[2] Over a recording career that lasted 59 years, she was the winner of 13 Grammy Awards and was awarded the National Medal of Art by Ronald Reagan and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George H. W. Bush.\n\n.: Albums :.\n\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook (1956) (Buddy Bregman)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Rodgers &amp; Hart Songbook (1956) (Bregman)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook (1957) (Duke Ellington &amp; Billy Strayhorn)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Irving Berlin Songbook (1958) (Paul Weston)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook (1959) (Nelson Riddle)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook (1961) (Billy May)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook (1963) (Riddle)\n* Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Johnny Mercer Songbook (1964) (Riddle)\n\n.: Rewiew :.\n\nThe Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks were a series of eight studio albums released in irregular intervals between 1956 and 1964, recorded by the American jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, supported by a variety of orchestras, big bands, and jazz quartets.\n\nThey are considered a cornerstone of 20th century recorded popular music, and as a whole, represent some of the finest interpretations of the greater part of the musical canon known as the Great American Songbook.\n\nThe New York Times columnist Frank Rich was moved to write a few days after Fitzgerald's death that in the songbook series, she &quot;performed a cultural transaction as extraordinary as Elvis's contemporaneous integration of white and African-American soul.&quot;\n\nHere was a black woman popularizing urban songs often written by immigrant Jews to a national audience of predominantly white Christians. As Ira Gershwin said, in the line quoted in every obituary: &quot;I never knew how good our songs were until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them.&quot; Most of the rest of us didn't know, either. By the time she had gone through the entire canon, songs that had been pigeonholed as show tunes or jazz novelties or faded relics of Tin Pan Alley had become American classical music, the property and pride of everyone.&quot; [1]\n\nFrank Sinatra was moved out of respect for Fitzgerald to block Capitol from re-releasing his own albums in a similar, single composer vein.\n\nVerve reissued the eight albums in 1994 in this expansive boxset, which won the 1995 Grammy for Best Historical Recording.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://images.umvd.com/ToeNails/4D70C71F2052416491151EA0F3B4D88A.jpg[/img]\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 1) Cole Porter Vol. 1\n\n01 - All Through The Night\n02 - Anything Goes\n03 - Miss Otis Regrets (She's Unable To Lunch Today)\n04 - Too Darn Hot\n05 - In The Still Of The Night\n06 - I Get A Kick Out Of You\n07 - Do I Love You\n08 - (I'm) Always True To You In My Fashion\n09 - Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)\n10 - Just One Of Those Things\n11 - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\n12 - All Of You\n13 - Begin The Beguine\n14 - Get Out Of Town\n15 - I Am In Love\n16 - From This Moment On\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 2) Cole Porter Vol. 2\n\n01 - I Love Paris\n02 - You Do Something To Me\n03 - Ridin' High\n04 - Easy To Love\n05 - It's All Right With Me\n06 - Why Can't You Behave\n07 - What Is This Thing Called Love\n08 - You're The Top\n09 - Love For Sale\n10 - It's De-Lovely\n11 - Night And Day\n12 - Ace In The Hole\n13 - So In Love\n14 - I've Got You Under My Skin\n15 - I Concentrate On You\n16 - Don't Fence Me In\n17 - You're The Top\n18 - I Concentrate On You\n19 - Let's Do It (Let's Fall In Love)\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 3) Rodgers &amp; Hart Vol 1\n\n01 - Have You Met Miss Jones\n02 - You Took Advantage Of Me\n03 - A Ship Without A Sail\n04 - To Keep My Love Alive\n05 - Dancing On The Ceiling (He Dances On My Ceiling)\n06 - The Lady Is A Tramp\n07 - With A Song In My Heart\n08 - Manhattan\n09 - Johnny One Note\n10 - I Wish I Were In Love Again\n11 - Spring Is Here\n12 - It Never Entered My Mind\n13 - This Can't Be Love\n14 - Thou Swell\n15 - My Romance\n16 - Where Or When\n17 - Little Girl Blue\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 4) Rodgers &amp; Hart Vol 2\n\n01 - Give It Back To The Indians\n02 - Ten Cents A Dance\n03 - There's A Small Hotel\n04 - I Didn't Know What Time It Was\n05 - Ev'rything I've Got\n06 - I Could Write A Book\n07 - Blue Room\n08 - My Funny Valentine\n09 - Bewitched\n10 - Mountain Greenery\n11 - Wait Till You See Her\n12 - Lover\n13 - Isn't It Romantic\n14 - Here In My Arms\n15 - Blue Moon\n16 - My Heart Stood Still\n17 - I've Got Five Dollars\n18 - Lover\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 5) Duke Elington Vol 1\n\n01 - Rockin' In Rhythm\n02 - Drop Me Off In Harlem\n03 - Day Dream\n04 - Caravan\n05 - Take the 'A' Train\n06 - I Ain't Got Nothing But The Blues\n07 - Clementine\n08 - I Didn't Know About You\n09 - I'm Beginning To See The Light\n10 - Lost In Meditation\n11 - Perdido\n12 - Cotton Tail\n13 - Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 6) Duke Elington Vol 2\n\n01 - Just A-Sittin' And A-Rockin'\n02 - Solitude\n03 - Rocks In My Bed\n04 - Satin Doll\n05 - Sophisticated Lady\n06 - Just Squeeze Me\n07 - It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\n08 - Azure\n09 - I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart\n10 - In A Sentimental Mood\n11 - Don't Get Around Much Anymore\n12 - Prelude To A Kiss\n13 - Mood Indigo\n14 - In A Mellow Tone\n15 - Love You Madly\n16 - Lush Life\n17 - Squatty Roo\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 7) Duke Ellington Vol 3\n\n01 - I'm Just A Lucky So And So\n02 - All Too Soon\n03 - Everything But You\n04 - I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)\n05 - Bli-Blip\n06 - Chelsea Bridge\n07 - Portrait Of Ella Fitzgerald Royal Ancestry All Heart Beyond Category Total Jazz\n08 - The E And D Blues (E For Ella, D For Duke)\n09 - Rehearsal\n10 - Chelsea Bridge (alternate take)\n\n\nElla Fitzgerald - The Complete Song Books (Disc 8) Irving Berlin Vol 1\n\n01 - Let's Face The Music And Dance\n02 - You're Laughing At Me\n03 - Let Yourself Go\n04 - You Can Have Him\n05 - Russian Lullaby\n06 - Puttin' On The Ritz\n07 - Get Thee Behind Me Satan\n08 - Alexander's Ragtime Band\n09 - Top Hat, White Tie, And Tails\n10 - How About Me\n11 - Cheek To Cheek\n12 - I Used To Be Color Blind\n13 - Lazy\n14 - How Deep Is The Ocean\n15 - All By Myself\n16 - Remember\n\nDISC 9: THE IRVING BERLIN SONG BOOK PART 2:\n\n1.
