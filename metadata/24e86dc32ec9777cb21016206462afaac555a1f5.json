As the lead singer of Miami Sound Machine she had been\ncredited in the group's actual name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gloria Estefan and Miami Sound\nMachine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ on their 1987 Let It Loose album. With &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot; many\nbelieved Gloria to have gone solo, but that is not true, Epic Records still\ncredited Gloria as Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine. It would not be\nuntil 1991 when Miami Sound Machine became a backup band for Gloria.\nOn the Cuts Both Ways album she combined a lot of pop, contemporary\nmusic, rock, dance music and of course, like all the past albums, Latin\nrhythms. The album is considered one of the best albums of her entire\ncareer, and has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide to this day,\ntopping the album charts in several countries such as UK.\n\nThe first single from the album was &quot;Don't Wanna Lose You&quot;, which became\na great success; in the USA it reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for a\nweek, becoming only her 2nd number one in the USA. The song also\nbecame one of her best-known ballads and the single was certified Gold in\nthe USA, while in countries such as The Netherlands, Ireland, Brazil and the\nUK it reached the Top Ten.\n\n\n  01.
