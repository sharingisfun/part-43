This album finds him in an unaccompanied solo setting, with the first six selections featuring him manning an electric piano while the other seven tracks put him behind a conventional acoustic model. Lots of boogies and shuffles here for Perkins to stretch out on, and he pays tribute to many of his early inspirations, like Sunnyland Slim, Leroy Carr, Eddie Boyd and others. Highlights include &quot;Kidney Stew,&quot; &quot;Pinetop's Boogie Woogie,&quot; &quot;Song for Sunnyland Slim,&quot; &quot;Five Long Years&quot; and the title track. If you want to hear a boogie-woogie master unencumbered by surrounding instruments in the band and laying it down with ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lan and pizzazz, this disc fills the bill nicely. ~ Cub Koda\n\n\nTracklist\n1 Down In Mississippi 4:41 \n2 Song For Sunnyland Slim 4:59\n3 Pinetop's Boogie Woogie 4:17 \n4 Little Girl, Little Girl 5: \n5 Just a Little Bit 3:17 \n6 How Long 4:26 \n7 Miss Ida B 4:24\n8 I Almost Lost My Mind3:59 \n9 Big Fat Mama 3:38 \n10 Five Long Years 4:07 \n11 Take It Easy Baby 4:19 \n12 Pinetop's Piano Shuffle 3:20 \n13 Kidney Stew 3:59\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e53ac489c6d4d851ddecc5c99e1b5646b59b47e6","amp;dn":"Pinetop+Perkins+Down+in+Mississippi+%28blues%29+%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e53ac489c6d4d851ddecc5c99e1b5646b59b47e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,58,196,137,198,212,216,81,221,236,197,201,158,27,86,70,181,155,71,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
