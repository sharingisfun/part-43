We even all have matching black-and-orange Halloween sweaters! I wanted a theme song for people like me, and for us Halloween never ends. In the chorus I say, 'I'm keepin' Halloween alive, baby, 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“6ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5'... and I mean it!&quot;\n\n&quot;Keepin' Halloween Alive&quot; was co-written and co-produced by Cooper with Piggy D.

Dave Pino (POWERMAN 5000) is featured on lead guitar, and David Spreng (BOB DYLAN, THE BRAVERY) on drums.\n\nOf the recording, Cooper says, &quot;We played it live as a band to capture the vibe. It was the easiest work I think any of us have ever done, not to mention a blast!&quot;\n\n&quot;We are thrilled to be working closely again with the legendary Alice Cooper on his new Halloween-themed single and adding to Shout! Factory's expansive digital audio library,&quot; said Bob Emmer, Shout!
