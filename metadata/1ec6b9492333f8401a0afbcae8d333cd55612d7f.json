Frank starts off by going over how to calibrate a light meter to get consistent, accurate results on every shot. He goes on to discuss how to calculate the fall off of light from the subject, how to create color tints in the background, how moving the light sources can result in dramatically different images, and how changing the camera angle affects the focus plane. Frank also has some tips on positioning the models and how to achieve accurate color results with a color checker. Photographers can take their studio photography to the next level with the help of this course.\n\nLesson 01 Calibrating Your Light Meter (4:51)\nLesson 02 Inverse Square Law (12:56)\nLesson 03 Colored Backgrounds (2:58)\nLesson 04 High Contrast Portraits (7:28)\nLesson 05 Getting Correct Exposure (7:28)\nLesson 06 Lens Choices (7:47)\nLesson 07 Angles (6:44)\nLesson 08 Accurate Colors (2:05)\nLesson 09 More Lighting Ideas (7:13)\n\nTOTAL: 00:59:30\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec6b9492333f8401a0afbcae8d333cd55612d7f","amp;dn":"Kelby+Training+-+Why+Fake+It+When+You+Can+Create+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec6b9492333f8401a0afbcae8d333cd55612d7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,198,185,73,35,51,248,64,26,10,251,202,232,211,51,205,85,97,45,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
