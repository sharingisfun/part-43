The other new tracks off of the EP were revealed to be, Tunde Adebimpe's &quot;Pray For Rain&quot;, Martina Topley-Bird's &quot;Psyche&quot; and Guy Garvey's &quot;Bulletproof Love&quot;. The latter two tracks appear as remixes of the intended album versions and none of &quot;LP5&quot;'s tracks are expected to resemble the versions that were played on tour, with some songs, such as &quot;Dobro&quot;, dropped altogether.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_attack\n\n--\n\nArtist: Massive Attack\nAlbum: Splitting the Atom EP (2009)\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01.
