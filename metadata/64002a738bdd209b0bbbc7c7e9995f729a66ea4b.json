He only had two fingers on his left hand you know. Many tracks Feat. StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane Grappelli, the violin player. \n\nIf you have not heard of Mr. Reinhardt, you are in for a treat. If you do not like jazz, I challenge you to listen to this and not like it!\n\nRipped to mp3 &amp; can't recall what bitrate It was encoded at, as I ripped it a while ago, not that It really makes a world of difference in my humble opinion.\n\nEnjoy, seed, and burn for all your friends. Spread the gospel of Django!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64002a738bdd209b0bbbc7c7e9995f729a66ea4b","amp;dn":"Django+Reinhardt+-+I+Got+Rhythm+Two+Disc+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64002a738bdd209b0bbbc7c7e9995f729a66ea4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,0,42,115,139,221,32,155,11,187,199,199,233,153,95,114,154,102,234,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
