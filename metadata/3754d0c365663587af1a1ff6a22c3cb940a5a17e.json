Mick Jones was in the crowd, and joined the band on stage during the Clash's &quot;Bankrobber.&quot; An encore followed with Jones playing guitar and singing on &quot;White Riot&quot; and &quot;London's Burning&quot;. This performance marked the first time since 1983 that Strummer and Jones had performed together on stage. Joe later remarked that it was totally unplanned and that he felt compelled to join Strummer on stage.\n\nThe Acton Town Hall, a much remixed soundboard, very professional clean recording is the one to get. Some say it lacks any audience though. The full audience version does not though. Very good and preferable in many ways to the soundboard. You can clearly hear the roar when Mick comes on.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://img244.imageshack.us/img244/508/strummerpp0.jpg[/img]\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1 Shaktar Donetsk\n2 Bhindi Bhagee\n3 Rudie CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Fail\n4 Tony Adams\n5 White Man in Hammersmith Palais\n6 Mega Bottle Ride\n7 Get Down Moses\n8 Police &amp; Thieves\n9 Cool ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Out\n10 Police on My Back\n11 Johnny Appleseed\n12 Coma Girl\n13 I Fought the Law\n14 Bankrobber\n15 White Riot\n16 LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Burning\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3754d0c365663587af1a1ff6a22c3cb940a5a17e","amp;dn":"Joe+Strummer+and+Mescarelos-+Acton+town+hall+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+TNT+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3754d0c365663587af1a1ff6a22c3cb940a5a17e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,84,208,195,101,102,53,135,175,26,31,246,162,44,60,185,64,165,161,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
