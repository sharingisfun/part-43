For the past two thousand years calendars were set by the birth of Christ. The terms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnno DominiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (AD) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBefore ChristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (BC) became the global dating system. The life and work of Jesus Christ altered the course of global history and resulted in a vast belief system and lifestyle followed by billions\non Earth. Fast forward 2001 years 9 months and 11 days since the recorded birth of Christ and we find ourselves at another date that diverted the course of history. The events that transpired on September 11th, 2001 have resulted in new terms and beliefs that echo from the mouths of politicians and media brass. We are constantly reminded that we live in a post-9/11 world and that we\nmust have faith in the official 9/11 account passed down from our Government. The actions on that fateful day have impacted the entire globe. The deaths of US Troops and innocent civilians have now superseded the lives lost on 9/11. Removing our shoes and discarding toothpaste at airports and warrantless wiretapping of all Americans has become the measure to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œensure our safetyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nHow do we undo this madness? How do we get back, not to 9/12 where we were scared and looking to the Government for answers, but to 9/10 where the Patriot Act and Real ID were mere dreams? The answer is simple but you must be ready to accept it. First, we must understand what really happened on 9/11 and second, we must prosecute the real terrorists who planned and executed the controlled demolition of our Republic. Let our 16th issue of Republic Magazine be the doorway as you walk the path exploring the facts, science and truth about the date that split time into a pre and post 9/11 world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://truthnews.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://truthnews.info&lt;/a&gt;\n88.7 FM Olympia, WA (west side)\n-sig_garrett-\n\nPirate Bay Torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sig_garrett&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sig_garrett&lt;/a&gt; \nMy RSS feed:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/1c1385103961eaf0bc327b67f04e1c2c&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/1c1385103961eaf0bc327b67f04e1c2c&lt;/a&gt; \nMininova Torrents: \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63672800a707a15a6dc3700f6d0ce8e8409cf6d0","amp;dn":"Republic-Magazine16.Uncovering.911.Truth.2009.08-sig-garrett.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63672800a707a15a6dc3700f6d0ce8e8409cf6d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,103,40,0,167,7,161,90,109,195,112,15,109,12,232,232,64,156,246,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
