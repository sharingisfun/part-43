I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz. But lately I've increased to 64kbs and 44100hz.\n\n3. Hit the button\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb :) ) \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2c1c252438bd218c2d84cc76bf8a5ebf2a50938","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Classical+Mythology+%28compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2c1c252438bd218c2d84cc76bf8a5ebf2a50938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,193,194,82,67,139,210,24,194,216,76,199,107,248,165,235,242,165,9,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
