The band's first album, and the vaudevillian &quot;Hello, Hello&quot; in particular, had more in common soundwise with earlier songs by The Lovin' Spoonful than typical 1960s psychedelic rock; producer Erik Jacobsen produced for both Sopwith Camel and The Lovin' Spoonful.[3] The band was unable to follow up the success of their first album and hit single and disbanded later in 1967.[1] Sopwith Camel's debut album has been re-released twice as Frantic Desolation in 1986 and as Hello Hello Again in 1990.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8828f417c0d1d3540a9b9d8b0bb279aa3be4cef3","amp;dn":"Sopwith+Camel+-+Hello+Hello+%28Complete+Album%2C+1967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8828f417c0d1d3540a9b9d8b0bb279aa3be4cef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,40,244,23,192,209,211,84,10,155,157,139,11,178,121,170,59,228,206,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
