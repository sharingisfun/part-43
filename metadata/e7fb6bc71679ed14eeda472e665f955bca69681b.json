Standing at the Crossroads \n\nReview from All Music Guide:\n(5 STARS)\n\nWith the confusing plethora of Elmore James discs out on the market, this is truly the place to start, featuring the best of his work culled from several labels. Highlights include James' original recording of &quot;Dust My Broom,&quot; &quot;It Hurts Me Too,&quot; &quot;T.V. Mama&quot; (with Elmore backing Big Joe Turner), and the title track, one of the best slow blues ever created. Slide guitar doesn't get much better than this, making this particular compilation not only a perfect introduction to Elmore's music, but an essential piece for any blues collection. \n\n~ Cub Koda, All Music Guide\n\nRipped by MidnightRocker with EAC, from the factory-pressed silver CD.\nCompressed with FLAC, using Frontend 1.7.1 - level 8.\nIncludes non-compliant wav and flac CUE files and single wav CUE file.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7fb6bc71679ed14eeda472e665f955bca69681b","amp;dn":"Elmore+James+-+The+Sky+is+Crying%3A+The+History+of+Elmore+James+%281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7fb6bc71679ed14eeda472e665f955bca69681b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,251,107,199,22,121,237,20,238,218,71,46,102,95,149,91,202,105,104,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
