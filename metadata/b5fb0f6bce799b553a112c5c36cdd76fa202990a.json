Producer/overseer Uwe Nettelbeck, a onetime music journalist, formed Faust in Wumme, Germany, in 1971 with founding members Hans Joachim Irmler, Jean HervÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ron, Werner &quot;Zappi&quot; Diermaier, Rudolf Sosna, Gunther Wusthoff, and Armulf Meifert. Upon receiving advance money from their label, Nettelbeck converted an old schoolhouse into a recording studio, where the group spent the first several months of its existence in almost total isolation, honing its unique cacophonous sound with the aid of occasional guests like minimalist composer Tony Conrad and members of Slapp Happy. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nLabel:\t\t\tBureau B\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Tell The Bitch To Go Home\n02.Herbststimmung\n03.Something Dirty\n04.Thoughts Of The Dead\n05.Lost The Signal\nBouffe\n07.Whet\n08.Invisible Mending\n09.Dampfauslass 1\n10.Dampfauslass 2\n11.Pythagoras\n12.Save The Last One\n13.La Sole DorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5fb0f6bce799b553a112c5c36cdd76fa202990a","amp;dn":"Faust+-+Something+Dirty+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5fb0f6bce799b553a112c5c36cdd76fa202990a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,251,15,107,206,121,155,85,58,17,44,92,54,205,215,111,162,2,153,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
