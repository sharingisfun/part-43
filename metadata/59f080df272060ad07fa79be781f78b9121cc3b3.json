He explores classics such as I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Want Your Mandolins Mister (&quot;Tone Poems&quot;), Church Street Blues (&quot;Blake &amp; Rice&quot;), and More Pretty Girls Than One (&quot;Skaggs &amp; Rice&quot;). Tony pays homage to the Carter Family on The Storms are on the Ocean, breaks down his dazzling licks on Blue Railroad Train (&quot;Manzanita&quot;), and gives us an updated version of Red Haired Boy, complete with a Clarence White intro/ending.\n\nDelving into a more improvisational mode, Tony shows how he takes simple ballads like Barbara Allen, Wayfaring Stranger and Summertime and - by adding chord substitutions, voicings, movable scales, free rhythm and other ideas - builds beautiful, complex guitar arrangements.\n\nWe get rare glimpses into TonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life through his stories, humor and reminiscences of the remarkable musicians who have influenced his music through the years. TonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s playing, as well as his musical insights, knowledge and advice, will fascinate and delight acoustic guitar players everywhere.
