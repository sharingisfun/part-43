Major influences included Procol Harum and The Left Banke.\n\nThey are best known for their 1971 hit &quot;Mammy Blue&quot; , referring to a son's poignant song addressed to his departed mother about his childhood memories and life in general, sometimes spelled &quot;Mommy Blue&quot; or &quot;Mammy Blue&quot;, or misspelled as &quot;Mummy Blue&quot;, which was a Top 10 hit throughout much of Europe, Japan, and Canada (#42), and a minor Billboard Hot 100 chart hit in the United States as well.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34a6d103fe82939afdba18f4fc630b09c5f401e8","amp;dn":"The+Pop+Tops+-+Mamy+Blue+-+Vinylrip+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34a6d103fe82939afdba18f4fc630b09c5f401e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,166,209,3,254,130,147,154,253,186,24,244,252,99,11,9,197,244,1,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
