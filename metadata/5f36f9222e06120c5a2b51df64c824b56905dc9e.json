Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria's angle, while from Melbourne's angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.\n\nStory wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.\n\nOverall, &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush.\n\n\nStarring:\nEmily Blunt, Rupert Friend, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Mark Strong\n\nDirected by: Jean-Marc Vallee\n\nProduced by: Martin Scorsese\n\nVideo Source: Noir\n\nSubtitles By: Faidra\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/OmifastGR&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f36f9222e06120c5a2b51df64c824b56905dc9e","amp;dn":"The+Young+Victoria+%282009%29+-+DivX7+Recode+-+Omifast+Greek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f36f9222e06120c5a2b51df64c824b56905dc9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,54,249,34,46,6,18,12,90,43,81,223,100,200,36,181,105,5,220,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
