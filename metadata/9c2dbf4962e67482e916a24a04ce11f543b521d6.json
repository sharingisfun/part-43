Britain's own urban guerillas. Libertarian socialists. Genteel\nby comparison with Italy's Red Brigades and West Germany's Red Army Faction\n(Baader-Meinhof Gang). Active in the late 60s/early 70s. Made symbolic attacks\non property (not people) - embassies of repressive regimes, boutiques (including\nBiba), police stations, army barracks, government departments, and the homes of\nCabinet ministers, the Attorney General &amp; the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.\n\nIt's not publicly known how many attacks they made - for a while their activities\nwere concealed. Research implies that there were about 200. It was the Brigade's own\nideology rather than the police that stopped them. They took direct action because -\nin their view - the old left had failed to bring change. But this view was transformed \nwhen the 1974 strikes brought down Heath's government. In light of what happened under \nThatcher, they were mistaken. But one thing's for certain though, their analysis of the \ngrowing damage consumerism was doing - would continue to do - to society and the planet \nwas spot on.\n\nEight people were selected for trial from two branches of a much larger 'community'.\nFour were acquitted. The others each got ten years. Their trial was the longest in British\ncriminal history. And it still looked like a fit-up.\n\nThis is a reconstruction of the trial combined with other background information.\n\nCast Includes\nKenneth Cranham\nJuliette Stevenson\nMark Strong\n\n[url]http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/AngryBrigade/[/url]\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c2dbf4962e67482e916a24a04ce11f543b521d6","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+-+Graham+White%5C%27s+%5C%27The+Trial+Of+The+Angry+Brigade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c2dbf4962e67482e916a24a04ce11f543b521d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,45,191,73,98,230,116,130,233,22,162,74,4,206,17,245,67,181,33,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
