The main surprise is the concept that crime\nscene analysts are the true crime solvers, when in truth, it takes\ndozens of people, doing many different jobs, to solve a crime.\nOften, the crime scene analystÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contribution is a small one.\nOne Minnesota forensic scientist says that the public ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhas gotten\nthe wrong idea. Because I work in a lab similar to the\nones on CSI, people seem to think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m solving crimes left and\nrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just me and my microscope. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe me\nwhen I tell them that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just the investigators that are solving\ncrimes, not me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nCrime scene analysts do have an important role to play,\nhowever. Science has rapidly added a whole new dimension\nto gathering and assessing evidence. Modern crime labs can\nmatch a hair of a murder suspect to one found on a murder\nvictim, for example, or recover a latent fingerprint from a\nthreatening letter, or use a powerful microscope to match tool\nmarks made during the wiring of an explosive device to a tool\nin a suspectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possession.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ff7c28278d61966a117db607b45e5e912fb0478","amp;dn":"Forensic+Art+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ff7c28278d61966a117db607b45e5e912fb0478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,247,194,130,120,214,25,102,161,23,219,96,123,69,229,233,18,251,4,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
