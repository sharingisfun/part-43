In the end, either such permission was denied or DC decided not to pursue the matter further.  While the cover of the 18th issue did state &quot;Final Issue&quot;, and led to the events off the final television episode - it also left various plot threads from the comic series unresolved.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4d6e94a8ba2b8a39be8f17acd91f7194278b1e9","amp;dn":"V+-+The+Series+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4d6e94a8ba2b8a39be8f17acd91f7194278b1e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,214,233,74,139,162,184,163,155,232,241,122,205,145,247,25,66,120,177,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
