The name stands for \\&quot;Operating System/2,\\&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\\'s \\&quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)\\&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0b798058c6a3c18a2158c9395118dde018dd77","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Blue+-+8.200+-+UK+English+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0b798058c6a3c18a2158c9395118dde018dd77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,11,121,128,88,198,163,193,138,33,88,201,57,81,24,221,224,24,221,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
