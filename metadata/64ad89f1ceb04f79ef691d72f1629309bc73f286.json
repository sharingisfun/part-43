Sourced from a first-generation tape. Also available in MP3.\n\nThis is by far the best sounding version of Pet Sounds as of today.\n\nI fixed three oddities :\n\n1. The tape dropout at the beginning of &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot;;\n2. the unusually long gap beetween side A and side B;\n3. the inclusion of &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot;; which I always felt was out of place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ad89f1ceb04f79ef691d72f1629309bc73f286","amp;dn":"The+Beach+Boys+-+Pet+Sounds+%28Audio+Fidelity%29+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ad89f1ceb04f79ef691d72f1629309bc73f286","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,173,137,241,206,176,79,121,239,105,29,114,241,98,147,9,188,115,242,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
