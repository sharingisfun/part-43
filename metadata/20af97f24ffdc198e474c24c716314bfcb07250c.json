In a subterranean chamber, 14,000 feet up, they found a gigantic 55-panel mural from the 13th century depicting important Buddhist sages and 11th century Tibetan manuscripts, suggesting a gathering place for a large religious communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½perhaps the sort of meditative, self-sufficient community that inspired the myth of Shangri-la.\n\nAthans and Coburn returned in 2008 with a multidisciplinary team to properly document, study, and begin to preserve the treasures. Join us as Athans shares images, stories and video from this remarkable Tibetan site that is shedding light on the spread of Buddhism through the Himalaya.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 29s 256ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 004 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 132 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20af97f24ffdc198e474c24c716314bfcb07250c","amp;dn":"National+Geographic-Secrets+of+Shangri-La+%282009%29.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ek","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20af97f24ffdc198e474c24c716314bfcb07250c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,175,151,242,79,253,193,152,228,116,194,76,113,99,20,191,203,7,37,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
