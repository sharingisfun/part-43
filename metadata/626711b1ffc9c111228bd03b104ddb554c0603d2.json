We'll understand open systems, the difference between a protocol and a standard, understand all of the functions that must be done to interoperate systems, how the functions are organized into manageable pieces with the ISO Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) 7-layer reference model, and examples of popular ways of implementing the layers to make a protocol stack. You'll learn what a layer is, the purpose of each layer, see examples of protocols used to implement each layer, and learn how a protocol stack really works with the famous &quot;FedEx Analogy&quot; presented as an embedded video by our top instructor, Eric Coll. \n\nLesson Description: L1104: Protocols and Standards \nIn this lesson, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll understand what is meant by the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprotocolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and how that relates to the concept of a standard. \nWe will also start considering how many functions have to be performed to interoperate systems, and how these functions might be organized.
