Brothers Conner and Murphy MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) take to performing their divine duty against the Russian mob. They massacre a bunch of unsuspecting Mafioso in a scene of absurd violence, then they let more blood in a mass killing of porn-shop customers. Instead of getting thrown in jail, they are dubbed &quot;saints&quot; by the Boston Herald, and they are praised by brilliant, tortured, and gay FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe). \n\nRipped with Handbrake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca669c55622ab6158777f05db429d68e6640ece","amp;dn":"Boondock+Saints%281999%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca669c55622ab6158777f05db429d68e6640ece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,166,105,197,86,34,171,97,88,119,127,5,219,66,157,104,230,100,14,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
