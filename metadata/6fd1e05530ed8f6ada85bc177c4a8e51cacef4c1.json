Boudwin\n\n\nExterior models\n\nThe highly detailed models include modelled rivets and stitching on the fuselage.\nA unique mapping technique provides a 'canvas' texture to the exterior finish and carefully researched colours have been applied in such a way as to replicate the unusual 'colour change' effect of the paint used on the S.E.5A.\nEach model has a fully animated pilot, opening gun-hatch and a Lewis gun which swings down on its Foster mount.\nAll rigging is accurately modelled, including the RAF aerodynamic rigging wire and round flying wires, bottle screws and fittings.\nInspection windows in the wings and tail reveal the pulley gear for the control wires to ailerons and elevator.\nRadiator shutters on the Viper variant operate from the cockpit and detail includes bungee cord 'suspension', correct Palmer AeroCord tyres and even tyre valves in the wheel covers.\nHighly detailed Vickers and Lewis machine guns are included, as well as engine detail such as radiator and fuel caps and priming cups.\nVirtual Cockpits\n\n'Baked' textures for a worn, period look.\nAccurate renditions of all the period instruments and fittings, including the fuel hand pump, fuel tank selector, magneto switches and a 'working' magneto with crank handle for starting.\nIncludes a spare magazine for the Lewis gun (visual only) and working trim wheel for 'elevator' trim.\nFeatures all internal rigging wires and flying wires, and the correctly modelled flying control wires and fittings.\nAnimations\n\nFully animated pilot\nOpening gun-hatch\nLewis gun which swings down on its Foster mount\nRadiator shutters on the Viper variant\nPropeller\nRudder\nElevators\nAilerons\nWheels\n\nSpecial effects\n\nEngine start smoke effect\nGun firing effects and sounds\n\nTextures\n\nWe have attempted to replicate the look and feel of a Great War fighting machine. Much debate over actual colours exists, but a mix between dark green and chocolate results in a fascinating 'colour change' effect, depending on lighting. We believe that, from researched data and period pictures, that this is how the S.E.5A would have appeared over the front lines of war-torn France.\n\n\nPaintkit\n\nA paintkit is supplied with all weathering and detail included on the layers. (It is assumed that you have a working knowledge of Photoshop techniques and re-painting Flight Simulator models.)\n\n\nFlight dynamics\n\nHighly tuned S.E.5A flight dynamics\nSounds\n\nA high quality sound set brings the S.E.5A to life and effects include start-up, idle and RPM reduction when inverted.\nManual\n\nA comprehensive colour PDF manual is included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fd1e05530ed8f6ada85bc177c4a8e51cacef4c1","amp;dn":"FSX-JustFlight-S.E.5A+Legends+of+Flight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fd1e05530ed8f6ada85bc177c4a8e51cacef4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,209,224,85,48,237,143,106,218,133,188,23,124,74,142,81,202,206,244,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
