This album features music that sounds like a mixture of King Crimson and Anglagard. Bubu was quite a large band. Along with the usual guitar/bass/drums, the band also had a violinist, flutist, and saxophonist. They are also helped out by a part-time pianist. The album consists of three long compositions written by a composer who does not play in the band. Their music is complex, energetic, and diabolical in a King Crimson-ish sort of way. Many sections feature exciting interplay between the guitarist, flutist, violinist, and saxophonist. The last two tracks feature short passages with spanish vocals, and even Magma-influenced choir. If you're looking for an introduction to the Argentinian progressive rock, or if you're a fan of Anglagard, this is an album to add to your collection.&quot;\n-- Steve Hegede / Ground and Sky --\n\n&quot;...This is a pretty adventurous album, but there is so much good music that repeated listenings can't help but be rewarding. The most impressive thing is that it manages to have a foot in either camp, being both melodic and avant-garde, without sounding like a compromise.&quot;\n-- Conrad Leviston / Ground and Sky --\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=bubu-ana&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=bubu-ana&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=3184&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=3184&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gepr.net/bi.html#BUBU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gepr.net/bi.html#BUBU&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dfcb688f3920af54b7e5e9fd7302b1e86c8daeb","amp;dn":"Bubu+-+1978+-+Anabelas+%28Argentinean+Eclectic+Prog%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dfcb688f3920af54b7e5e9fd7302b1e86c8daeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,252,182,136,243,146,10,245,75,126,94,159,215,48,43,30,134,200,218,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
