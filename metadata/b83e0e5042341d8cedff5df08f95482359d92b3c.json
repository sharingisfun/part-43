All were short-lived.\n\nThe line started off with one-shots Unearthly Spectaculars #1, Thrill-O-Rama #1, Blast-Off #1, and Warfront #36 in October, 1965, using work that was apparently done for the 1950s Thrill Adventure line. The next issues would not come out until almost a year in September, 1966! Along with the new titles were two reprint titles for Fighting American and The Spirit, which did include new stories for these characters. All the titles ended by March 1967.\n\nAll titles feature work by many well known creators, including Jack Kirby, Bob Powell, Wally Wood, Otto Binder, and the earliest known work by Jim Steranko.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Warfront #36 is currently unscanned.\n\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83e0e5042341d8cedff5df08f95482359d92b3c","amp;dn":"Harvey+Thriller+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83e0e5042341d8cedff5df08f95482359d92b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,62,14,80,66,52,29,140,237,255,93,240,143,149,72,35,89,217,43,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
