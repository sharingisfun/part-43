Drawing equal inspiration for their name from the children's television program The Banana Splits and the Roxy Music song &quot;Pyjamarama,&quot; the trio was comprised of lifelong friends Keren Woodward and Sarah Dallin along with Siobhan Fahey, whom Dallin befriended at the London College of Fashion. After getting their start singing at friends' parties and at nightclubs (where they performed accompanied by backing tapes -- none of the women played her own instrument), they came to the attention of ex-Sex Pistols drummer Paul Cook, who produced Bananarama's first single, a cover of Black Blood's &quot;A.I.E. (A Mwana).&quot; After the group backed Fun Boy Three on the single &quot;It Ain't What You Do, It's the Way You Do It,&quot; the Three returned the favor for 1982's &quot;He Was Really Sayin' Somethin',&quot; a cover of the 1965 Velvelettes song that was the first of Bananarama's 26 U.K. chart smashes.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tPop\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Venus\n02.Love In The First Degree\n03.Robert De Niro's Waiting\n04.Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)\n05.Really Saying Something\n06.Cruel Summer\n07.Shy Boy\n08.I Want You Back\n09.Nathan Jones\n10.I Heard A Rumour\n11.More, More, More\n12.Only Your Love (Single Version)\n13.I Can't Help It\n14.Love, Truth &amp; Honesty\n15.It Ain't What You Do\n16.Rough Justice\n17.Last Thing On My Mind\n18.Long Train Running\n19.Preacher Man\n20.Movin' On\n21.Help\n22.Venus/I Heard A Rumour/Love In The First Degree (Tempus Fugit Mix)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6833e120146ae41082930a1dd898f2895127c9a1","amp;dn":"Bananarama+-+The+Very+Best+Of+%282001%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6833e120146ae41082930a1dd898f2895127c9a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,51,225,32,20,106,228,16,130,147,10,29,216,152,242,137,81,39,201,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
