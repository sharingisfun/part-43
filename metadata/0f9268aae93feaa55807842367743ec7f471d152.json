Written by Kelis, Shondrae &quot;Bangladesh&quot; Crawford, Too Short, and Sean Garrett, it was released in the United States in May 2006 as the lead single (and final single in Australia) from Kelis' fourth studio album, Kelis Was Here (2006). The song peaked at number sixteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, making it the singer's second biggest Hot 100 hit thus far. While &quot;Bossy&quot; entered the top ten in Finland and the top twenty in Australia and New Zealand, it failed to chart or sell noticeably elsewhere.\n\nIt is believed that the track features a response to 50 Cent's 2005 song &quot;Piggy Bank&quot;. In &quot;Bossy&quot;, Kelis states &quot;That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard/And that's right, I'm the one tattooed on his arm&quot;, in response to 50 Cent rapping, &quot;Kelis said her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard/Then Nas went and tattooed the bitch on his arm&quot; in his song. The lyric &quot;I'm the first girl to scream on a track&quot; refers to her debut single &quot;Caught out There&quot;, in which she &quot;screamed&quot; the chorus. The lyric &quot;I'm back with an 808&quot; refers to the Roland TR-808 drum machine, which was used to create the drum beat.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, &quot;Bossy&quot; was certified double platinum by the RIAA.\n\nThe video for &quot;Bossy&quot;, directed by Marc KlasfeldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½who would work with Kelis on &quot;Blindfold Me&quot; and &quot;Lil Star&quot; later that yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and produced by Rockhard Films Co was shot in February 2006 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe video presents Kelis in different scenarios and outfits, depicting an atmosphere from an upper-class world; from a diamond, octopus-filled party to a red Enzo Ferrari drive out in the night. It premiered on BET in May 2006.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f9268aae93feaa55807842367743ec7f471d152","amp;dn":"Kelis+-+Bossy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f9268aae93feaa55807842367743ec7f471d152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,146,104,170,233,63,234,165,88,7,132,35,103,116,62,199,244,113,209,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
