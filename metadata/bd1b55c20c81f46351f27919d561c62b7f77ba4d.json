In this interview, get the scoop on Solomon's &quot;bass-ackwards&quot;\n entry into the world of screenwriting and how being just a funny guy translated\n into being a funny professional. \n\n\n  \n enjoy!                                                                  \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                     \n      Release notes                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                    \n                                                                     \n     Greetings                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1b55c20c81f46351f27919d561c62b7f77ba4d","amp;dn":"The.Dialogue.Ed.Soloman.2007.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1b55c20c81f46351f27919d561c62b7f77ba4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,27,85,194,12,129,244,99,81,242,121,25,213,97,198,43,127,119,186,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
