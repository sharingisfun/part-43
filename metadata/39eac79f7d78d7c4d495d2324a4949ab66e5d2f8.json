The trio worked with producer Cameron McVey on the majority of the album, which produced four top forty hits, including the top five hit &quot;Overload&quot;, and &quot;Run for Cover.&quot;\nDespite peaking at number 26 on the UK Album Charts and being certified Gold by the BPI, and faring even better in German-speaking Europe, where it reached the top ten in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, the sales of One Touch did not meet London Records' expectations, and the group eventually got dropped in Autumn 2001, making it their only release with the label. In addition, it became the group's only album with the group's original line-up. SiobhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n Donaghy left the group stating initially that she wanted to pursue a fashion career, eventually being diagnosed with clinical depression amid reports of in-fighting between the Sugababes members\nThe album received favourable reviews, with critics applauding the girls, who were all 16 years of age at the time, for writing and singing songs, which were considered to be unusually mature for their age. \n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Overload\n[02] One Foot In\n[03] Same Old Story\n[04] Just Let It Go\n[05] Look At Me\n[06] Soul Sound\n[07] One Touch\n[08] Lush Life\n[09] Real Thing\n[10] New Year\n[11] Promises\n[12] Run For Cover\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:48m:20s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 118mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v7.6.2.9 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop R&amp;B\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 27 November 2000\n\nRecord Company\t\t- London Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.sugababes.co.uk \n\t\t\t- http://www.sugababes.com/home.php \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Sugababes \n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/Profile.jsp?MemberId=4679785091 \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/Sugababes \n\t\t\t- \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39eac79f7d78d7c4d495d2324a4949ab66e5d2f8","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+One+Touch+-+Sugababes+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39eac79f7d78d7c4d495d2324a4949ab66e5d2f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,234,199,159,125,120,215,196,212,149,210,50,74,73,73,171,102,229,210,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
