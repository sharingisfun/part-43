I had to go through twenty-nine albums, a ton of lost-to-time weblogs, and splice live sets to get everything. For most of his releases, USAO develops hardstyle, jumpstyle, gabber, and hardcore tracks. If you're into J-Core or simply like hard electronic music, I encourage you to give USAO a try.\n\nMy favorite tracks by him, as a recommended sampling if you don't want to search through all 131 songs:\n\n01. Irrelevance - Hardcore Syndrome 3\n02. Another Sect (USAO &amp; DJ Nanashi Mix) - Kick's for Liberation 2\n03. Eyehole - SPEED BALL Z\n04. Nuit Blanche - Hardcore Syndrome 4\n05. Non Combustible Waste - SPEED BALL Z\n\n\nRelease Info:\nThe songs are sourced from twenty-nine albums, obtained from torrents, web-storage hosts, official WEB-releases, and ripped from live sets. The isolated tracks category contains tracks that are from compilation albums (Various Artists) or remixes, while the Albums section contains disc released under USAO's publisher UOM Records. The albums by BASS SHOT IDIOTS are live sets between USAO and DJ Wildparty. All tracks for which album art exists have had it embedded as meta-data stripped JPGs &lt;=800x800 pixels. All tracks have been tagged with the proper tags that exist for them. Lossless tracks have been included when available, though the majority (2/3rd) are in LAME MP3 format. The majority of the MP3s are either 320CBR, V0s, or V2s, so the quality is acceptable.\n\n\nSidenotes:\nIf you are able, I encourage you to support USAO in making fresh new music by purchasing the albums he appears on, attending his live-sets, or simply sharing your favorite tracks with your friends. Enjoy.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.voiceblog.jp/kimu25/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.voiceblog.jp/kimu25/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tano-c.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tano-c.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTracklist:\nIsolated:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n01.
