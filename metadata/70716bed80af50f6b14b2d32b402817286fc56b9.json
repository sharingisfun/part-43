I want a player that will \nplay any format i throw at it, but remain light, portable, and stealth. So i can\nplay it anywhere, carry it with me on my USB Stick, and not leave any trash on\nthe host computer. I have tested sooo many, including CyberLink, VLC, SMPlayer,\nKMPlayer, Storm Player, QQ Player, MPlayer, etc.. \n\nThe last one standing is SPlayer. It played everything i threw at it while \nremaining light, fast, and beautiful on the eyes. They even offer a portable\nversion on their site, but it's not 'Stealth', it leaves registry keys and files\nbehind. So i created this.. If you don't mind trash being left behind, you can \ndownload the official portable version from their site.\n\nStealth Notes:\n- Encapsulated all registry entries\n- Encapsulated 'SPlayer' folder created in AppData&gt;Roaming\n- Disabled Auto Update\n\nFeatures:\n- Low Consumption\n- Easy to use\n- Extreme Compact\n- Safe and Portable\n- Automatic Matching Subtitle\n- Exquisite Beauty\n- Binary Codecs (1 player for all your Video needs, including HD/Rare formats)\n\nComparison:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haEIjAAdF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haEIjAAdF&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInterface:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haeiLaadf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haeiLaadf&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMulti-Format Support:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haeimAaDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haeimAaDF&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70716bed80af50f6b14b2d32b402817286fc56b9","amp;dn":"SPlayer.v3.6.Portable.Stealth.Multilanguage+%28VLC+Alternative%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70716bed80af50f6b14b2d32b402817286fc56b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,113,107,237,128,175,80,246,177,75,45,50,180,2,129,114,134,252,86,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
