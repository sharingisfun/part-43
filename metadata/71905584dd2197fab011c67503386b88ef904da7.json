ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo be careful from now on.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTo prove just how futile SonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s efforts are, graf_chokolo retaliated in dramatic fashion.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGuys, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t joke, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s serious. And to prove it, I kept my word and uploaded all my HV [hypervisor] reversing stuff. Upload it everywhere so SONY [can't] remove it easily. Grab it guys, it contains lots of knowledge about HV and HV procs,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he wrote, while publishing links to where the material could be found.\n\nToday there are rumors floating around that Sony is working on a new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhack-proofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ version of the PS3. If they do a good job, as they did last time despite the recent hack, the machine might see out its natural life-cycle without being jailbroken.\n\nBut Sony have stirred up such a hornets nest with their recent action against Geohot and friends, all theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done is paint the digital equivalent of a great big target on their chests. Short-sighted? You bet.\n\n\nKeep this torrent alive so hobby hackers everywhere can mod; let's show Sony they can't control what's ours.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71905584dd2197fab011c67503386b88ef904da7","amp;dn":"Hypervisor+Bible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71905584dd2197fab011c67503386b88ef904da7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,144,85,132,221,33,151,250,176,17,198,117,3,56,107,136,239,144,77,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
