William Joyce (1906-1946), nicknamed Lord Haw-Haw, was a fascist politician and Nazi propaganda broadcaster to the United Kingdom during the Second World War. In 1932 Joyce joined the British Union of Fascists (BUF) under Sir Oswald Mosley, and swiftly became a leading speaker, praised for his power of oratory. He was executed for treason by the British government as a result of his wartime activities. While many have never heard of any british fascists one can't help to notice that many ideas they represented and are included in this rare booklet somehow got their way to Italy and Germany with disastrous consequences. 10 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d437ff107d4b989feb7bbad11f9a42bda671e9df","amp;dn":"Joyce-Dictatorship%28case+against+democracy%26pro-fascism%29%281933%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d437ff107d4b989feb7bbad11f9a42bda671e9df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,55,255,16,125,75,152,159,235,123,186,209,31,154,66,189,166,113,233,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
