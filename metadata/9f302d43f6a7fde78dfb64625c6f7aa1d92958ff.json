Freedom Comes A'ye 4:33\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nHe may be best-known as the guitarist with that bravely experimental trio Lau\n(who won best group for the third year running at last month's Folk awards), but\nKris Drever has all the makings of a solo celebrity. Born in Orkney, he moved\nsouth to join the freewheeling Edinburgh folk scene, in which musicians are\nconstantly swapping styles and playing in different bands so it's no surprise\nthat this latest solo album should feature an impressive and varied cast. The\nScottish contingent includes that exquisite fiddle player and producer John\nMcCusker, along with members of Capercaille. They are joined by the Irish singer\nHeidi Talbot, and the celebrated American bluegrass multi-instrumentalist Tim\nO'Brien, playing bozouki, mandolin, ukele, fiddle and banjo. This is very\ndifferent from a Lau set, for Drever concentrates not on instrumentals\nimprovisation and virtuoso guitar playing, but on his sturdy vocal work. The\nsongs range from the self-composed title track to a slinky piece from Boo\nHewerdine and a couple of ballads from that fine veteran Edinburgh songwriter\nSandy Wright, which are as unashamedly emotional as great country songs. A\nclassy set.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/kris-drever/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f302d43f6a7fde78dfb64625c6f7aa1d92958ff","amp;dn":"Kris+Drever...Mark+the+Hard+Earth%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f302d43f6a7fde78dfb64625c6f7aa1d92958ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,48,45,67,246,167,253,231,141,251,100,98,92,111,122,161,217,41,88,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
