It's all because of &quot;mind viruses,&quot; or &quot;memes,&quot; and those who understand how to plant them into other's minds. This is the first truly accessible book about memes and how they make the world go 'round.\n\nOf course, like all good memes, the ideas in Brodie's book are double-edged swords. They can vaccinate against the effects of cognitive viruses, but could also be used by those seeking power to gain it even more effectively. If you don't want to be left behind in the coevolutionary arms race between infection and protection, read about memes.............\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f787a17fcd53f61a34f9e92cfe9a805923349b1","amp;dn":"Virus+of+the+Mind%3A+The+Revolutionary+New+Science+of+the+Meme+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f787a17fcd53f61a34f9e92cfe9a805923349b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,120,122,23,252,213,63,97,163,79,158,146,207,233,168,5,146,51,73,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
