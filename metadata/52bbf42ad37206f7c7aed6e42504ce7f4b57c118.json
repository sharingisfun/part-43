I definitely agree with this, but what I don't agree with is the same people saying that Metal Church suck without David Wayne. \n\nThis isn't true at all. 'Hanging in the balance' is the only Metal Church album I have without David Wayne as the vocalist (I'm English, so I have to order up in HMV or Virgin and wait about 6 months before actually getting the Metal Church album I'm after). 'Hanging in the Balance' and 'Metal Church Live' were in a double-disk package that was actually in the shop so I took advantage of the situation and bought the package. \n\nSo anyway, 'H.I.T.B' offers melodic rhythms from songs like 'Waiting for a Saviour', 'End of the Age' and 'Lovers and Madmen'. \nSongs like 'Conducter', 'Down to the River' and 'Little Boy' pack lots of heaviness and even 80s thrash material. \n\nIf you're a fan of the first two Metal Church albums don't give it a miss just because it has Mike Howe instead of David Wayne. \nSure, it isn't as good as 'Metal Church' or 'The Dark' but it is a great album. \n\nRecommended songs: \n\nHypnotise \nWaiting for a Saviour \nLittle Boy \nDown to the River \nLovers and Madmen and \nA Subtle War\n\nby A X &quot;Mad metaller&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Gods Of Second Chance.wma                                        \n02 - Losers In The Game.wma                                           \n03 - Hypnotized.wma                                                   \n04 - No Friend Of Mine.wma                                            \n05 - Waiting For A Savior.wma                                         \n06 - Conductor.wma                                                    \n07 - Little Boy.wma                                                   \n08 - Down To The River.wma                                            \n09 - End Of The Age.wma                                               \n10 - Lovers And Madmen.wma                                            \n11 - A Subtle War.wma                                                 \n12 - Low To Overdrive (Bonus Track).wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nFollow Me On Facebook Pages: MarcelodrgzTPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52bbf42ad37206f7c7aed6e42504ce7f4b57c118","amp;dn":"Metal+Church+-+Hanging+In+The+Balance+%281993%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52bbf42ad37206f7c7aed6e42504ce7f4b57c118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,187,244,42,211,114,6,247,199,174,214,228,37,4,206,127,75,87,193,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
