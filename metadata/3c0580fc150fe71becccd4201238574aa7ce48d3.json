Burning Fiction self-released their\ndebut EP, &quot;Material&quot; in 2007 which has since brought with it a string of\ninternational support shows over the years with some of the bands who have\ninfluenced their sound such as Strung Out, A Wilhelm Scream, No use for a Name\nand Lagwagon.\n\nDon't Lose Touch is Burning Fiction's debut album. It was released on June\n19th 2009. Bringing honest, fast, trend-free punk rock to a thriving Perth\nscene, Burning Fiction entered Sovereign Studios to record their eleven track\ndebut album with Aidan Barton. The recording captures the intensity and\nenthusiasm of five young guys having a good time playing the style of punk\nrock they live for.\n\nTracks\n01 Ode\n02 Die Trying\n03 Walk Hard\n04 Last To Leave\n05 Two Finger Diet\n06 Paper Scissors\n07 The Enlistment\n08 With The Grain\n09 How Many Times\n10 Can't Kill Us All\n11 Sense Of Worth\n\nEnjoy The Music And Please Seed As Much As You Can. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c0580fc150fe71becccd4201238574aa7ce48d3","amp;dn":"Burning+Fiction+-+Don%5C%27t+Lose+Touch+%5B2009%5D+%5B320kbps%5D+%5B1337","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c0580fc150fe71becccd4201238574aa7ce48d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,5,128,252,21,15,231,27,236,204,212,32,18,56,87,74,167,206,72,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
