It includes aspects of exploration, combat, diplomacy and trade. It is set in the same period as Sid Meier's Colonization, but involves more detailed colony management, with no &quot;Old World&quot; politics. Parts, like expansion and movement of resources, are similar to the early Settlers games. Anno 1602 is an economic, rather than combat, orientated strategy game. Players are rarely challenged in battle. The game design is noteworthy for its attempt to implement a 'progressive' AI, meaning that the pace of the game changes in response to how quickly players act.\n\nThe sequels of the game are titled Anno 1503, Anno 1701 and Anno 1404.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f373905d4be3fb45c4b5963735f8eb600176ac4","amp;dn":"Anno.1602.%281998%29.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f373905d4be3fb45c4b5963735f8eb600176ac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,55,57,5,212,190,63,180,92,75,89,99,115,95,142,182,0,23,106,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
