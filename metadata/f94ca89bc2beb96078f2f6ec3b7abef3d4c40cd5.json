The novel goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead, where she is abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she acquires friends and role models but also suffers privations; her time as the governess of Thornfield Manor, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family at Marsh's End (or Moor House) and Morton, where her cold clergyman-cousin St John Rivers proposes to her; and her reunion with and marriage to her beloved Rochester at his house of Ferndean. Partly autobiographical, the novel abounds with social criticism and sinister gothic elements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f94ca89bc2beb96078f2f6ec3b7abef3d4c40cd5","amp;dn":"Jane+Eyre+by+Charlotte+Bronte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f94ca89bc2beb96078f2f6ec3b7abef3d4c40cd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,76,168,155,194,190,185,96,120,242,246,236,59,122,190,243,212,196,12,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
