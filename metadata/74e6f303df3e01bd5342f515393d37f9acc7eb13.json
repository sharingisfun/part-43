Al die vreemde gebeurtenissen zijn blijkbaar op de een of andere manier aan elkaar gelinkt: er is duidelijk 'een patroon' te herkennen dat over alle zaken heen loopt. Het patroon kan tevens gelinkt worden aan Massive Dynamic, een firma die een aantal patenten houdt op een aantal nieuwe technologieÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«n en enkele mysterieuze onderzoeken doet. Alle zaken draaien rond Fringe science, een tak van de wetenschap die zeer speculatief en omstreden is. Voorbeelden van deze tak van de wetenschap zijn levitatie, telepathie en onzichtbaarheid.\n\n\n\n\nFringe Seizoen 2:\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2, aflevering 1: A New Day in the Old Town\nOlivia is in a car accident, an unusual person is looking for a member of the team, and Walter makes plans for celebrating Peter's birthday.\n\n\n\t\nSeizoen 2, aflevering 2: Night of Desirable Objects\nA highway construction worker in rural Pennsylvania goes missing when he is mysteriously drawn into an underground tunnel filled with human remains. \nMeanwhile, back in the lab, Walter is attempting to simulate travel between realities on frogs.
