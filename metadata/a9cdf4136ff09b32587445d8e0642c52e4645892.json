Well, they do take a huge swipe at the immorality of modern capitalism and its politics, so no easy listening &quot;America is always right&quot;- songs .Where Mr Springsteen concentrates on the human politics of the ordinary American, Little Steven takes a more global approach. Maybe there is some crudity in the result but at least the attempt is being made. A very noble effort and such a radical difference to &quot;Men without women&quot;.\n\nAlthough, certainly not as accomplished as Steven's sensational debut &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, the album features some very good material. With a heavy political agenda in toe, &quot;Freedom&quot; opens the record. &quot;Freedom&quot; is quickly followed by the riveting &quot;Trail of Broken Tears&quot;. Little Steven's weathered voice is in full on Bob Dylan-meets-Keith Richards mode as he pronounces that &quot;there ain't no love here, love's been sacrificed, promises buried beneath, the trail of broken tears.&quot; The Latin-flavored &quot;Pretoria&quot; runs side by side with the album's best track, &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot; (a duet with Ruben Blades. And although the track sounds like one big party, upon closer inspection, it's clear that the song is a solemn condemnation on the state of intrusive U.S. anti-communism Reaganomics in Latin America. Surprisingly, in Europe, the track proved to be a massive hit for Little Steven. Coupled with the success of another one of Freedom No Compromise's tracks, &quot;No More Partys,&quot; the E-Street sideman would return to the old continent as an arena sensation in his own right. Another track worth noting is &quot;Native American,&quot; a collaboration with Bruce Springsteen. Freedom No Compromise comes to an end with &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (a not so distant cousin of &quot;Bitter Fruit&quot;). Overall, a good effort, sometimes a great one. For another taste of the artist, spend some quality time with the album &quot;Men Without Women&quot;. \n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nSteve Van Zandt - Guitar, dulcimer\nSteve Jordan, David Beal, Keith LeBlanc - drums\nRomeo Williams, Doug Wimbish, T.M.
