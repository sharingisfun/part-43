But will today's jazz audience be down with the &quot;F&quot; word? White thinks so. &quot;I'm convinced that there is a whole new audience out there that will respond enthusiastically to this music, just as people did 30 years ago.&quot;\n\n--- JAZZIZ Magazine Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2000, Milor Entertainment, Inc.\n\n\nAnother quality TQMP release!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec4f2f5bbcd815e1492b393e3b45fd7bd5d2ea9","amp;dn":"Vertu+1999+FLAC+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec4f2f5bbcd815e1492b393e3b45fd7bd5d2ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,196,242,245,187,205,129,94,20,146,179,147,227,180,95,215,189,93,46,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
