Torpey was later replaced by Mick Stewart and then by Andy Scott in August 1970.\n\nDuring the early years of 1971 and 1972, Sweet's musical style followed a marked progression from the Archies-like bubblegum style of the first hit, &quot;Funny Funny&quot;, to a Who-influenced heavy rock style supplemented by a striking use of high-pitched backing vocals. The band achieved notable success in the UK charts, with thirteen Top 20 hits during the 1970s alone, five reaching number 2 and one, &quot;Block Buster!&quot;, reaching number 1.\n\nSweet membership has undergone a number of changes, and during different periods Scott, Connolly and Priest also each formed their own &quot;Sweet&quot;, resulting in the separate bands Andy Scott's Sweet, BC Sweet and Steve Priest's Sweet.\n\nConnolly died in 1997, and Tucker in 2002.\n\nTwo of the bands are still in existence: the U.S. version of The Sweet, founded by original bass player Steve Priest, and the U.K. version of The Sweet, featuring Andy Scott.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
