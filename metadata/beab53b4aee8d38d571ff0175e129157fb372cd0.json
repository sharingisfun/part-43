While not a great movie, the plot is interesting, the acting better than average, the characters in line with the Dick Tracy milieu and the dialog well written.\nThe actor playing Dick Tracy, Morgan Conway, sounds just a bit like Humphry Bogart (at least in this film). Anne Jeffreys, who plays Dick Tracy's girlfriend, later played Marion Kerby, one of the two ghosts in the TV series, Topper. Mike Mazurki, who plays Splitface, is a character actor who plays a heavy in scores of B-movies.&quot;\n\nPlot:\nA city is gripped with fear as a mad slasher known only as &quot;Splitface&quot; terrorizes its inhabitants and leaves a trail of murders. But Dick Tracy senses a common link and unravels a sinister web of extortion and revenge. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beab53b4aee8d38d571ff0175e129157fb372cd0","amp;dn":"Dick+Tracy+%281945%2C+aka+Dick+Tracy%2C+Detective%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beab53b4aee8d38d571ff0175e129157fb372cd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,171,83,180,174,232,211,141,87,31,240,23,94,18,145,87,251,55,44,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
