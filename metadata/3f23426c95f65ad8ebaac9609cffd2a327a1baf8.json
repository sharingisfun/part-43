The mixing and matching meant 2003's Waking the Fallen had as many sighing harmonies as it did harmonized guitar freakouts. And yet City of Evil, the band's third record and Warner debut, is absolutely rife with the imagery and pacing of classic metal. Look at that artwork. It features a skeletal swordsman flying a steed with steaming nostrils over the urban inferno of the title; tattoos, demons, and a skull with flapping wings adorn the lyric book. The New Wave of British Heavy Metal influence is immediate and prevalent, from the maniacally rippling percussion throughout to the triumphantly whining lead guitars in the chorus of &quot;Blinded in Chains,&quot; or the soaring melody in &quot;Burn It Down&quot; that meets its match in Metallica-styled verses.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f23426c95f65ad8ebaac9609cffd2a327a1baf8","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold+-+Beast+and+the+Harlot+%28dagger%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f23426c95f65ad8ebaac9609cffd2a327a1baf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,35,66,108,149,246,90,216,235,170,201,96,156,255,210,163,39,161,186,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
