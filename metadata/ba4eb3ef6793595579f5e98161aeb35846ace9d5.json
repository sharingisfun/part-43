This dvd contains six episodes, each covering a different type of engine - the imperial steam engine, the workhorse diesel, the exhilarating supercharger, the laid back v8, the noisy, smelly two-stroke, and the jet, the engine that went on to shrink the world. This is the highly-acclaimed channel 4 television series - a celebration of design, engineering and individual genius. If you want to see a man single-handedly remove the engine from a trabant, or toast marshmallows in the afterburner of a military jet aircraft, then this is the film for you - the guardian. I have a confession to make says robbie coltrane. I am a nosey bastard. I am incapable of walking past a piece of machinery without wanting to know all the details of its private life.\n\nPart 4. The Laid Back V8\nThe development of the V8 engine, from its origins in the Cadillac through its use by Ford during the Depression to its place in US motorsport.\n\nIMDB Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBFI Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 23 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 336 MB\nSource: DVDRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4eb3ef6793595579f5e98161aeb35846ace9d5","amp;dn":"Coltranes+Planes+and+Automobiles+4of6+Xvid+AC3+MVGroup+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4eb3ef6793595579f5e98161aeb35846ace9d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,78,179,239,103,147,89,85,121,245,233,129,97,174,179,88,70,172,233,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
