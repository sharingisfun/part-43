Dedicating his work to Elizabeth I, Spenser brilliantly united Arthurian romance and Italian renaissance epic to celebrate the glory of the Virgin Queen. Each book of the poem recounts the quest of a knight to achieve a virtue: the Red Crosse Knight of Holinesse, who must slay a dragon and free himself from the witch Duessa; Sir Guyon, Knight of Temperance, who escapes the Cave of Mammon and destroys AcrasiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Bowre of Bliss. Although composed as a moral and political allegory, The Faerie QueeneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s magical atmosphere captivated the imaginations of later poets from Milton to the Victorians.\n\nEpisode 1- A Gloriously Swashbuckling Retelling of St George and the Dragon\nEpisode 2- Sir Guyon, the Knight of Temperance, journeys to the Bower of Bliss.\n\nProducer: Toby Swift\nCast: Simon Russell Beale; Holly Aird; David Oyelowo; Lloyd Hutchinson\n\nWith thanks to ONO, the original uploader\n\nTaken from Digital Satellite Source- encoded to 160 kbps mp3 44Hz\n\n\nTotal Length- 114 mins (57 mins x2)\nTotal Size- 132MB (66MB x 2)\nTotal Size:\t130.98 MB\n\n\n\nRipped from the audio torrent site - radioarchive.cc - registrations are FREE!!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca52b12a7c35e7ccc9ad958fe3a6ab03952b0dd","amp;dn":"The+Faerie+Queen+-+Edmund+Spencer++%28BBC+Audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca52b12a7c35e7ccc9ad958fe3a6ab03952b0dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,165,43,18,167,195,94,124,204,154,217,88,254,58,106,176,57,82,176,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
