He discovers our sense of time passing and the clocks that drive our bodies. He reveals the forces of time that make and destroy us in a lifetime. He journeys to some of the Earth's most spectacular geological sites to look for clues to the extraordinary depths of time at a planetary level. Finally, he takes us on a cosmic journey in search of the beginning (and the end) of time itself.\n\n\n\n\nPart 4: Cosmic Time\n\nWe've always structured our lives based on an unchanging past and a predictable and ordered future. But atomic and cosmic discoveries have changed all that. What is time itself? And will it ever end?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abee22e66b3be3acec38ebf09f16df37c6778859","amp;dn":"Time+%28BBC+2006+-+Part+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abee22e66b3be3acec38ebf09f16df37c6778859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,238,34,230,107,59,227,172,236,56,235,240,159,22,223,55,198,119,136,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
