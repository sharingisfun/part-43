In a recent interview Randall recalled the following about the concept of Trekker;\n\n&quot;I created Trekker for Dark Horse Comics back in their early days. Mike Richardson and Randy Stradley offered me the chance to create a book for them, offering in essence a creative &quot;blank check&quot; where I was allowed to produce what I wanted. So, I asked myself what elements I'd want in a book, and put them all into Trekker: a strong female lead character, a gritty science fiction background, and a life &quot;story arc&quot; that takes a character-- and the reader-- through some changes. And artistically, I wanted to bring all the things I most admired in sci-fi art into play, which for me was completely personified in the work of Al Williamson on his brilliant EC Comics in the 50's, his later work on Flash Gordon, and his Star Wars work, while also restricting the amount of &quot;fancy rendering&quot; that I'd used up til then in my work. \n\nTrekker is a sci-fi bountry hunter book. It's the story of a young woman who has extraordinary skills and extraordinary personal demons. Her story begins with her emersed in a grim world full of violent, desperate people. On one hand she is a &quot;trekker&quot; as she tracks down the bad guys. But the real story, the real &quot;trek&quot; I was interested in, was exploring that world, the price it exacts on one; seeing if there is another way to go for her, and if so is it one she can successfully make it to. The ultimate goal in Trekker was to tell good tales while exploring ideas like social connection, responsibility, violence, what are we all here for... the usual stuff an overly-ambitious aspiring writer wants to tackle&quot;.\n\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:813ca078bbb4905bd39bb9dc16454b17160d9252","amp;dn":"Trekker+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"813ca078bbb4905bd39bb9dc16454b17160d9252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,60,160,120,187,180,144,91,211,155,185,220,22,69,75,23,22,13,146,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
