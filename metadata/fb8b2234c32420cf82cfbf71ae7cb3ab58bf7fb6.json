And another personal favourite Rajyan-Kalyan from the Teacher album is added as a bonus.\nCD3: Is a classic album with a remastered LP-sound. The Raga Bilashkani Todi with its very hypnotic sound of the tamboura ringing in the background will make you... fly. Well... if your mood is right, that is ;)\n\n\nNote: and if you are new to this music, I think the best approach is to try and listen to it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½in the momentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as every note (and cycle) stands by itself as well as it connects to the next. Making a traditional Raga (often full of improvisation) to begin in one place and end up somewhere else... A raga is played like life itself, give it a try. Well, nuff said: Just listen!\n\n\n\n\n320 kbit/s\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Bearded_Phantom/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Bearded_Phantom/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8b2234c32420cf82cfbf71ae7cb3ab58bf7fb6","amp;dn":"Ravi+Shankar+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+3+Collections+of+Ragas+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8b2234c32420cf82cfbf71ae7cb3ab58bf7fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,139,34,52,195,36,32,207,130,207,191,113,174,124,179,171,88,191,127,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
