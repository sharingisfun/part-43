Building on images taken from the Hubble telescope, Journey to the Edge of the Universe explores the science and history behind the distant celestial bodies in the solar system.\n\nThis spectacular, epic voyage across the cosmos, takes us from the Earth, past the Moon and our neighboring planets, out of our Solar System, to the nearest stars, nebulae and galaxies and beyond - right to the edge of the Universe itself. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Yavar Abbas\n------------------------\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Sean Pertwee\n-------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Journey To The Edge Of The Universe\nYear: 2008\nFile Size: 1,11 GB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:33:26\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 688x432\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1715 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect ratio: 1.593\nFPS: 25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels: 2\nSubtitles: (External English)\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1363109/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1363109/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              **** External Subtitle Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; English ****\n\n\n\n\n\n                      ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af0c413dfed7cd7fc7031b1b5182c121ca4dcd4","amp;dn":"Journey+To+The+Edge+Of+The+Universe-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af0c413dfed7cd7fc7031b1b5182c121ca4dcd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,240,196,19,223,237,124,215,252,112,49,177,181,24,44,18,28,164,220,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
