But these devices have had a\n      profound impact on how we get around. Skyscrapers, subway systems,\n      department stores, airports - these structures are all possible thanks\n      to elevators, escalators, and moving sidewalks. In fact, these devices\n      have transformed our buildings, our cities, and our lives.\n\n      From the early 'safety elevator' designed by Elisha Otis to the newest\n      high-speed travelator (moving sidewalk) we will examine the profound\n      impact these machines have had on how we get around.\n\n   _______________________________________________________________________________\n\n                                    Yours truly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96adca5785fcdf39617ec3a4e1586a87db78a6f2","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Things.That.Move.Elevators.HDTV.XviD-YT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96adca5785fcdf39617ec3a4e1586a87db78a6f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,173,202,87,133,252,223,57,97,126,195,164,225,88,106,135,219,120,166,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
