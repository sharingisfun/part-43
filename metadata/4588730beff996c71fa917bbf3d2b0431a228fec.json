The near-surrealistic plotline concerns priggish US presidential candidate Paul Meurisse, who carries on a sterile, clinical courtship with Ingrid Nordine. Proposing that he and Nordine have an image-boosting &quot;picnic on the grass&quot;, the scientifically-oriented Meurisse is distracted by the visceral charms of country girl Catherine Rouvel. Previously a strong advocate of &quot;artificial sex&quot;, Meurisse changes his mind after dallying with the lusty Rouvel. Almost childlike in its approach to the material at hand, Picnic on the Grass is one of Renoir's most playful efforts.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmovie.com/work/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-38085&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmovie.com/work/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-38085&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*************************************************************************************\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 734,332,928\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 1:28:45 (133110 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: DivX 5.0.5\nFrame Size ............: 672x384\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 974 kb/s\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 116 kb/s [2 channels] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\nNo. of audio streams ..: 1\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
