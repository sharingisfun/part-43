Our tribute to the music that drives us in 90th, that shook stadiums and clubs and which really united people and forced to believe that words &quot;Peace! Love! Unity! Respect!&quot;- not simply set of letters. It was the era really a dance music! And on this release we meaningly focused attention on a dancing component of our style. We make this to underline all our respect for Euro-dance Era! And now, with feeling of the executed debt, we will continue work over our second album!&quot;\n\n\nTrack list:\n1.
