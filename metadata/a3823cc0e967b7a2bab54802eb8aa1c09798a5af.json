His fierce attack is so expert yet sounds so effortless that it makes you believe anyone armed with 12 bars and six strings can pull it off.&quot; -- Billboard. \n\n&quot;Few blues guitarists performing today can top the intensity of former John Mayall sideman Coco Montoya's torrid, Albert Collins-inspired attack. Shards of shivering, \nfeedback-enhanced blue notes fly off the Southern California picker's ax and cut deep into the rhythm section's grooves.&quot; -- San Francisco Chronicle. \n\n&quot;Blistering contemporary blues ... piercing attack; funky, shivery guitar tones; and aggressive, soulful vocals.&quot; -- Blues Revue.\n\n\n1.
