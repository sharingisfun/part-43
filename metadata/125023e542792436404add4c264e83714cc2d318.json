There is a limit of 300 copies, the site heading is &quot;Warning: this page will be taken down...&quot; and the regular price of $197 is discounted today only for $37. Is this something worth your time and interest?\n\nAndrew Wallace Auto Traffic Monopoly software uses a link wheel with Web 2.0 blogs, such that the links reinforce one another and drive traffic back to your own blog. The idea of creating back links is a necessary process so automating the work could be useful. You begin by crafting seven articles for seven blogs. The software determines where the articles are submitted. If you can get this to work, the appeal is there because most similar software has a monthly subscription fee. The first question is compatibility. We could not find any indication of compatible operating systems. Does the software work with Windows 7, ME, 98, Mac OS X, Mac Intel or PowerPC?\n\nThe developer's web site contains the interesting disclaimer that all products are for informational and educational purposes only and that one should use caution and seek advice from your accountant, attorney or other qualified professional before acting. There have also been reports of numerous additional offers at additional cost associated with the program.\n\nIf you can get Andrew Wallace Auto Traffic Monopoly software to work, it is conceivable there is great potential as the basic premise is valid. We recommend you follow the developers own counsel and proceed with caution.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125023e542792436404add4c264e83714cc2d318","amp;dn":"Auto+Traffic+Monopoly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125023e542792436404add4c264e83714cc2d318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,80,35,229,66,121,36,54,64,74,221,76,38,78,131,113,76,194,211,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
