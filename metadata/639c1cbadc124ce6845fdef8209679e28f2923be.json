(Previous torrent was bad)\n\n-----\n\nDark Shadows\nThe Complete Series Disc 1-1\n\nEpisodes\n\t0001 - 0009\n\nInterviews\n\tNone\n\nThere are several people out there who have graciously ripped and uploaded the\nDVDs of Dark Shadows over the last few years. However I have found that either\nthe quality is poor or the series is not completely available via torrent.\n\nI have decided to fill this gap as best as I can. I am providing each episode,\nas it is on the DVD.  However, I have de-interlaced it, brightened it up a bit\nand cropped the annoying black areas off the sides. The result is a 4:3 aspect\nvideo of high quality (696x480px) and moderate size (avg. 250Mb).\n\nI have also removed the opening slates from the episodes which contained them.\nI personally enjoyed them,  but my goal is to make a broadcast-quality copy of\nthe show, and they do become rather annoying after the 100th time.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-Camdolen\n\nVideo\n\tXviD Mpeg-4 (.avi)\n\t696x480\n\nAudio\n\ta52 48kHz\n\t192 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:639c1cbadc124ce6845fdef8209679e28f2923be","amp;dn":"Dark+Shadows+The+Series+Disc+1-1+%28camdolen%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"639c1cbadc124ce6845fdef8209679e28f2923be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,156,28,186,220,18,76,230,132,95,222,248,32,150,121,226,143,41,35,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
