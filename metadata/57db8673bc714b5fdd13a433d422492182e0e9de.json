I hear someone is also working on a\nHAVOC wrapper for phys-X chips as well....\n\nEven though you have to build your own message pump (like you would in C) you can build GUI programs in addition to standard console programs\n\nThe power of C/C++, but the flexibility of BASIC.. best combo ever!\n\nIf you've got more questions, or just want to go deeper visit the forums at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.freebasic.net/forum/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.freebasic.net/forum/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIf you want a library to simplify or enhance a freebasic or visual basic game you\nare building check out:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dabooda.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dabooda.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57db8673bc714b5fdd13a433d422492182e0e9de","amp;dn":"FreeBASIC+compiler+with+2+IDEs+and+chm+Manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57db8673bc714b5fdd13a433d422492182e0e9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,219,134,115,188,113,75,95,221,19,164,51,212,34,73,33,130,224,233,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
