He is the son of a Holocaust survivor, is pro-Israel, and lives in Rose Bay, New South Wales.\n\nAusten Tayshus burst into the consciousness of Australians in 1983 performing his comedy single, Australiana, a piece written by fellow comedian Billy Birmingham. This was a spoken word piece using Australian terms that conjured up different words built on extensive sets of equivocations, such as &quot;...my mate Boomer rang&quot;, &quot;...do you wanna game of Euchre Lyptus&quot;, and &quot;...how much can a koala bear?&quot; . It was the nation's biggest selling single of the year.\n\n\nClassic piece of Australian comedy/music\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53444952127842e8c168f06bcc69b93beac3807","amp;dn":"Austen+Tayshus+-+Australiana+%5B1983%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a53444952127842e8c168f06bcc69b93beac3807","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,52,68,149,33,39,132,46,140,22,143,6,188,198,155,147,190,172,56,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
