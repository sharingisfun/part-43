It contains many old faves [which are on every 80s compo going] \nplus some rarer classics and some songs I can barely remember. An absolute must for anyone who grew up in the 80s, \nor who wish they had! Best track: 'Some like it hot' by the Power station. A belter of a song, much under-rated \nin my humble opinion.\n\n\n\n[Disc 1]\n\n\n  01. [06:16] The Human League - Don't You Want Me [Special Extended Dance Mix]\n  02.
