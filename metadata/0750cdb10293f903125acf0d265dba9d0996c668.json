Further modulation is  \n   possible using the post-processing effects; an all-pass interpolator chorus  \n   provides a fuller sound and an over-sampled analogue prototype  paragraphic  \n   equaliser is provided  with dual LFOs.  These features make  for a livelier  \n   sound than typically  associated with some  convolution reverbs, at  a very  \n   competitive price.   \n             \n             \n   Features and Specifications:  \n             \n             \n   Stereo convolution reverb   \n             \n   Dual true-stereo IR capability   \n             \n   Zero latency (or select up to 8192 samples latency)   \n             \n   Wav, Aiff and Flac support   \n             \n   ADSHR envelopes   \n             \n   50%-150% stretch   \n             \n   Double oversampled IR-EQ   \n             \n   Pre-delay up to 500ms   \n             \n   Linear-interpolation choruses for IR1, IR2 and post effects   \n             \n   Post EQ with LFO modulation \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Choose Full Version, select the included AiR.lic \n                     and replace the dll from crack dir after install \n                            \n                  3) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n\n                          \n                  REPACK NOTE: \n                          \n                  Corrupted installers been in previous release.
