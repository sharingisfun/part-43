While recording the trio's albums Lots More Blues, Rags and Hollers and The Return of Koerner, Ray &amp; Glover he recorded a number of solo tracks. These tracks were assembled into Koerner's debut solo album. He also appeared at the Newport Folk Festival that same year, accompanied by trio member Tony Glover.\n\nHis style would change with his subsequent releases from the blues to more traditional folk music. In a 2000 interview, Koerner said, &quot;I finally decided I was not a blues guy. How could I be? I was too young and too white, all that shit. So I took a year off and when I started playing again, I treated the subject in general as folk music. It's a new culture; it's not music being made on a back porch anymore.&quot;\n\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/11/spider-john-koerner/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/11/spider-john-koerner/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f37c7c1be6f3ffed196a2924d8497fbe4bc55767","amp;dn":"Spider+John+Koerner...Spider+Blues%281965%29cd%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f37c7c1be6f3ffed196a2924d8497fbe4bc55767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,124,124,27,230,243,255,237,25,106,41,36,216,73,127,190,75,197,87,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
