This album is a perfect example of Eaglin's numerous styles and skills : Rhythm 'n' Blues (&quot;Oh Lawdy, My Baby&quot;), Swing-Jazz (&quot;Out of Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Mailman Blues&quot;), Soul music (&quot;You're so Fine&quot;) and even Country (&quot;Young Girl&quot;). Actually, the reason why this album is filed under Blues is more the instrumental settings and the arrangements than the music itself, except for the slow bluesy &quot;West Side Baby&quot;.\nTwo different instrumental settings support Snooks Eaglin throughout the album. Some tracks include only guitar, drums and bass ; some others feature a complete horn section and full rhythm accompaniment. The album also features Sam Myers on the harmonica (&quot;Young Girl&quot;). Finally, Snooks Eaglin appears alone on guitar in &quot;Kiss of Fire&quot;, a traditional tango tune.\nThe diversity of styles and ideas contained in &quot;Out of Nowhere&quot; are performed with Snooks Eaglin's unique guitar technique, spontaneous enthusiasm, and exuberant passion for the music.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
