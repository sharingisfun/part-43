You See Me Crying\n\n\nOriginally released in 1975, this was Aerosmith's breakout recording. Listeners only familiar with their more recent, post-comeback material may be surprised; like their other albums from the 1970s, Toys has a strong blues inflection, as indicated by their cover of &quot;Big Ten Inch Record,&quot; which also shows that Aerosmith has never lacked raunchiness or innuendo. There's also the original (pre-Run-D.M.C.) version of &quot;Walk This Way,&quot; and the classic &quot;Sweet Emotion.&quot; This is classic Aerosmith at its gritty, streetwise best; they may have been derivative, but it really doesn't matter, then or now: it's all in good fun.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Toys-Attic-Aerosmith/dp/B000002A6M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1275776897&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Toys-Attic-Aerosmith/dp/B000002A6M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1275776897&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ff736990a58554d4ba12b478aa72d4ddef775b","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Toys+in+the+Attic+%28Gold+Mastersound+1994%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ff736990a58554d4ba12b478aa72d4ddef775b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,255,115,105,144,165,133,84,212,186,18,180,120,170,114,212,221,239,119,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
