It is a not-so-veiled self-portrait of the director himself.\n\nWith Nilkantha travel a Bengali woman refugee, a once-respected writer who is now a literary hack, an unemployed trade unionist, and a penniless teacher of Sanskrit. The encounters and adventures that transpire during the pilgrimsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ painful progress express the directorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disillusionment with organized politics and the loss of his bedrock faith in even the everyday politics of experience.&quot;\n\nRip specs:\nFile: Jukti.Takko.aar.Gappo.avi\nTotal Streams: 2\nRunning Time: 1:53:36\nIndex Chunk: Yes\nInterleaved: Yes\nMax Bytes Per Sec: 0\nAUDIO: 0 - AC3 (0x2000)\nAverage Bitrate Per Sec: 192 kb/s\nSamples Rate: 48000 Hz\nChannels: 2\nBits Per Sample: 0\nSuggestedBufferSize: 12000\nSample Size: 1\nVIDEO: XVID\nB-VOP: No\nS(GMC)-VOP: No\nQuarterPixel: No\nFrame Size: 640 x 496\nAverage Bitrate Per Sec: 1523 kb/s\nFrames Rate: 23.976\nColor Depth: 12\nTotal Frames: 163440\nSuggestedBufferSize: 70168\n\nEng soft subs(.srt) included. \n\nThanks to the original uploader Zenkoan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a52a58a0dc367073b44281d123ff25c4a3f03a4","amp;dn":"Jukti.Takko.aar.Gappo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a52a58a0dc367073b44281d123ff25c4a3f03a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,82,165,138,13,195,103,7,59,68,40,29,18,63,242,92,74,63,3,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
