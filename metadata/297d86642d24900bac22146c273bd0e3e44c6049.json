The horror sprouts quite innocently from a small seed and finds life as something otherworldly, damaged, full of love, hate, fear, and power. As the walls come alive, everyone is slowly driven mad - defenseless against the evil in the building, stripped of free will, leaving only confusion, chaos, and eventual death!\n\nBy Gabriel Ba, Becky Cloonan, Vasilis Lolos and Fabio Moon.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:297d86642d24900bac22146c273bd0e3e44c6049","amp;dn":"Pixu+-+The+Mark+of+Evil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"297d86642d24900bac22146c273bd0e3e44c6049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,125,134,100,45,36,144,11,172,34,20,108,39,59,208,227,228,76,96,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
