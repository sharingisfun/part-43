Certainly, the singles were the highlights, but they had a handful of first-rate album tracks that made the records necessary for dedicated fans, even if the overall album was inconsistent. Contraband: The Best of Men at Work does a terrific job of consolidating all of their highlights onto one disc. From hits like &quot;Who Can It Be Now?,&quot; &quot;Down Under,&quot; &quot;Overkill,&quot; and &quot;It's a Mistake&quot; to slightly neglected album tracks like &quot;Be Good Johnny,&quot; Contraband has every great track from the Australian new wave band. For most fans, it will be the only disc they need.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01: Who Can It Be Now?\n02: Down Under\n03: It's A Mistake\n04: Hard Luck Story\n05: Still Life\n06: Underground\n07: Upstairs In My House\n08: I Like To (Live)\n09: High Wire\n10: Maria\n11: Be Good Johnny\n12: Dr. Heckyll &amp; Mr. Jive\n13: Overkill\n14: Man With Two Hearts\n15: Snakes And Ladders\n16: Down By The Sea\n\n\nInfo: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Contraband-Best-Men-at-Work/dp/B000002ABO&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Contraband-Best-Men-at-Work/dp/B000002ABO&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e43c8eae829f7b505ad928b0b6fe96afd4beccf","amp;dn":"Men+At+Work+-+Contraband+The+Best+of+Men+at+Work+%28Flac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e43c8eae829f7b505ad928b0b6fe96afd4beccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,67,200,234,232,41,247,181,5,173,146,139,11,111,233,106,253,75,236,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
