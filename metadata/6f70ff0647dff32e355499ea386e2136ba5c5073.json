These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.\n\nEpisode Info: There is no such thing as a typical day for the West Coast Marine Service, the force policing the coastline from Washington to Alaska. This episode follows a crew of the RCMP's specialized boat cops as they patrol the coast and deal with the intense and often bizarre situations they run into on a daily basis. From rescues at sea to stopping crime, this unit does it all.\n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the video quality of most of this episode is quite watchable in my opinion. The video quality from about 6:18 to 7:38 is not great, but this was a problem on the source recording so there is no easy way to fix it.  \n\nThe website for this show is here: http://courageinred.ca/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f70ff0647dff32e355499ea386e2136ba5c5073","amp;dn":"Courage.in.Red.S01E12.West.Coast.Marine.Services.WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f70ff0647dff32e355499ea386e2136ba5c5073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,112,255,6,71,223,243,46,53,84,153,234,56,110,33,54,186,92,80,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
