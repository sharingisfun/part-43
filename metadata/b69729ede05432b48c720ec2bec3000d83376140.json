You                 \n             have a very simple objective: Stop the board from                \n             filling up by forming rows of 5 or more pieces of                \n             the same color.

Build more lines in consecutive                 \n             moves to get the combo bonus for a higher score.                 \n             With every turn you may move only one piece, and                 \n             only if there is a clear path to its destination. As             \n             space becomes scarce there are less useful moves to              \n             choose from, so the game gets gradually harder.                  \n             Getting a high score by surviving as long as                     \n             possible is a challenge for every Arcade Lines                   \n             player.                                                          \n                                                                              \n             Many of our customers love to play Arcade Lines at               \n             work.
