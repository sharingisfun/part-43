The south east Londoners have sold more than a million copies of their three hit albums (the other two being 2005's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“TouristÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and 2007's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Beyond The NeighbourhoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢); packed out venues across the land; picked up an Ivor Novello award; and topped both the UK's album and airplay charts.\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black SwanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ , their fourth album, is a musical summary of everything Athlete have been through; the good, the bad and the ugly. But although its songs burn with literate emotion, this certainly isn't a downbeat record. In fact, the album begins with the hurtling FM rush of glorious first single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Superhuman TouchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which catapults the album into life with the opening line, &quot;I'm on fire and nothing's gonna hold me back&quot;.\n\n    The album reaches its climax with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Awkward GoodbyeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, an intensely personal tale of love slipping away; the snappy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Magical MistakesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a giddy gush of proud, parental love; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Rubik's CubeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which, according to Joel, &quot;Sums everything up. It's about puzzling through life, working it out as you go along and having to deal with its uncertainties. That's the magic of life, really.&quot;\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black SwanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the album was released Monday, August 24th, 2009. \n\n\n# Audio CD\n# Store Date: August 24, 2009\n# Format: Deluxe Edition\n# Number of Discs: 2\n# Label: Fiction/Polydor\n==================\nTrack List:\n\n'Black Swan'\n1 Superhuman Touch\n2 The Getaway\n3 Black Swan Song\n4 Don't Hold Your Breath\n5 Love Come Rescue\n6 Light The Way\n7 The Unknown\n8 The Akward Goodbye\n9 Magical Mistakes\n10 Rubik's Cube","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130334595e0a4bc6cd22a65507ad2ca8ac35e532","amp;dn":"Athlete+-+Black+Swan+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130334595e0a4bc6cd22a65507ad2ca8ac35e532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,3,52,89,94,10,75,198,205,34,166,85,7,173,44,168,172,53,229,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
