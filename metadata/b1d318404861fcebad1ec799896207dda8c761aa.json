James Booth stars as Charlie, a merchant seaman who returns home to the East End after two years to find that his wife Maggie (Barbara Windsor) has taken up with another man, a married bus driver named Bert (George Sewell). After taking his brother Fred (Roy Kinnear) hostage in a pub, Charlie gets a reunion with Maggie, who shows up pushing a pram. It seems she's given birth to a child, and the father's identity is uncertain. Charlie and Maggie reconcile, but not before a vicious row with Bert, who doesn't want to give up his girl. Windsor, a BAFTA Best Actress nominee for her role, also performed the film's title song. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057521/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057521/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:28:27\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1212 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d318404861fcebad1ec799896207dda8c761aa","amp;dn":"Sparrows+Can%5C%27t+Sing+%281963%29+Barbara+Windsor+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d318404861fcebad1ec799896207dda8c761aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,211,24,64,72,97,252,235,173,30,199,153,137,98,7,221,168,199,97,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
