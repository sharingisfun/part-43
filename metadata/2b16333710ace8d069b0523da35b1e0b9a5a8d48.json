Edel company's CD release is mastered very hot, accenting \nboth the dynamics of the music and the lack of ambience in the original \nrecording (a trait common to many soundtracks for MCA productions during the \n'70s).\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             THE EAC LOG (EXTRACT)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b16333710ace8d069b0523da35b1e0b9a5a8d48","amp;dn":"Stu+Phillips+-+Battlestar+Galactica+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b16333710ace8d069b0523da35b1e0b9a5a8d48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,22,51,55,16,172,232,208,105,176,82,61,163,91,30,11,154,90,141,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
