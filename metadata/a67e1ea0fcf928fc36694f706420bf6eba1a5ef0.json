The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html (or better yet http://wikileaks.ch/magnet.txt which is sometimes updated first).  The IP for this domain is 46.59.1.2 (now hosted in Sweden).\n\nIf you run a local WikiLeaks &quot;pull&quot; / &quot;scrape&quot; mirror (search P2P networks for &quot;wikileaks scrape&quot;), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or the 7z command on any UNIX-like operating system.\n\nThe bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!\n\nHTTP download mirror at http://alexlibman.com/dl/wikileaks/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a67e1ea0fcf928fc36694f706420bf6eba1a5ef0","amp;dn":"WikiLeaks+CableGate+-+March+25th%2C+2011%2C+5%3A53+AM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a67e1ea0fcf928fc36694f706420bf6eba1a5ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,126,30,160,252,249,40,252,54,105,79,112,100,32,191,110,186,26,94,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
