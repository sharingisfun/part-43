They emerged in the mid-1980s with a series of multi-platinum albums and hit singles whose music videos received heavy MTV rotation. They were initially famous for being a glam metal and hard rock band, but then shifted over towards a more blues-rock oriented sound. By the mid-1990s, the band's popularity waned due to personal setbacks and public changes in musical tastes. The band has sold over 18 million albums to date worldwide.\n\n\nCinderella was formed in Philadelphia in 1982 by singer-songwriter, keyboardist, and guitarist Tom Keifer and bassist Eric Brittingham. The initial lineup also included guitarist Michael Smerick and drummer Tony Destra. In 1985, Smerick and Destra left to form Britny Fox, another Philadelphia-based glam metal band that later relocated to Los Angeles. Cinderella got their big break when Jon Bon Jovi saw them perform at the Empire Rock Club in Philadelphia and recommended that his A&amp;R rep Derek Shulman who knew of the band, to see them as well.[1] In 1985, with a recording contract with Mercury/Polygram Records in the works, guitarist Jeff LaBar and drummer Jim Drnec joined the band.\n\nDuring the recording of the band's debut album, Night Songs, studio session drummer Jody Cortez was brought in when producer Andy Johns found Drnec difficult to work with.[2] While finishing the recording, Drnec was replaced by former London drummer Fred Coury, who joined in time to make the album's cover and play on upcoming tours. Night Songs was released on August 2, 1986 and eventually achieved triple platinum status, selling 50,000 copies per week at one point. The album reached #3 on the Billboard charts in February 1987.\n\nCinderella's first tour was in 1986 with fellow glam metal rockers Poison, opening for Japanese heavy metal band Loudness. Further tours into 1987 were spent playing to large arena audiences: five months opening for former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth, and seven months with Bon Jovi, taking the opening slot for their Slippery When Wet tour. Later that year, the band went overseas, appearing in Japan, Scandinavia, and at the Monsters of Rock festivals in England and Germany.\n\nCinderella's second album, Long Cold Winter, was released in 1988. It signified a shift towards blues-rock, though it could still be described as glam metal. A 254-show tour to support the album lasted over 14 months and included dates on the Moscow Music Peace Festival alongside other metal acts, such as Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions, MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e, Bon Jovi, and Skid Row. The tour's stage show included Keifer being lowered to the stage while playing a white piano during their radio hit &quot;Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)&quot;.\n\nCinderella's third album, Heartbreak Station, was released in 1990. It featured even more songs than Long Cold Winter that were influenced by Keifer's love of the blues, completely ditching the band's trademark glam metal sound. Following the accompanying tour, Fred Coury left the band and joined former Ratt vocalist Stephen Pearcy in the band Arcade.\n\nIn 1991, Keifer completely lost his voice due to a paresis of his vocal cords. He underwent several surgeries to repair a vocal cyst and hemorrhage.[3] This added to delays in the recording of the band's fourth album, Still Climbing. It was finally released in 1994 with Kenny Aronoff on drums, but with little support from their label, none from MTV, and the current music scene being dominated by grunge, the album quickly disappeared from the charts. The band went on hiatus in 1995.\n\nCinderella resumed activity in 1997, the same year Mercury Records released a greatest hits compilation titled Once Upon a.... The group toured the United States in 1998, with one stop captured on the live album Live at the Key Club, which was released in 1999 through Cleopatra Records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Cold Winter 1988\n\n\n\nLong Cold Winter is Cinderella's second studio album, released in 1988 through Mercury Records. It reached #10 in the US and became double-platinum for selling 2 million copies in the US by the end of the year, just as the debut album Night Songs had done earlier. Currently both albums are certified triple platinum.\n\nThe album features four singles, which were all hits in the US. &quot;Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)&quot;, which was to be Cinderella's highest-charting single, reached #12, &quot;The Last Mile&quot;, reached #36, &quot;Coming Home&quot; reached #20, and the classic &quot;Gypsy Road&quot; hit #51 a full year after the release of the album itself.\n\nWith Long Cold Winter, Cinderella started to move away from the glam metal-territory of their previous album and into a more blues-rock direction, akin to early 70's Rolling Stones, Humble Pie and Deep Purple.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart at the Seams&quot; - 5:19 \n2.\t&quot;Gypsy Road&quot; - 3:55 \n3.\t&quot;Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)&quot; - 5:54 \n4.\t&quot;The Last Mile&quot; - 3:51 \n5.\t&quot;Second Wind&quot; - 3:59 \n6.\t&quot;Long Cold Winter&quot; - 5:24 \n7.\t&quot;If You Don't Like It&quot; - 4:10 \n8.\t&quot;Coming Home&quot; - 4:56 \n9.\t&quot;Fire and Ice&quot; - 3:22 \n10.\t&quot;Take Me Back&quot; - 3:17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e6eb444728a0b4e2499bee1d12ff778ae5a7f74","amp;dn":"Cinderella+-+Long+Cold+Winter+1988+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e6eb444728a0b4e2499bee1d12ff778ae5a7f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,110,180,68,114,138,11,78,36,153,190,225,209,47,247,120,174,90,127,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
