Beginning with an analysis of the non-narrative subjects of the early art--the Good Shepherd, the praying figure, fish and birds--Jensen goes on to explore the narrative images found in Roman catacomb painting, sarcophagus relief sculpture, early mosaics, ivories, and manuscript illumination. \n\nFinally, the book examines iconographic themes such as Jonah, Daniel, Abraham offering Isaac, and Adam and Eve.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e03f055a4ad4e4d54661de4ceab3c87b745b1c9","amp;dn":"Understanding+Early+Christian+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e03f055a4ad4e4d54661de4ceab3c87b745b1c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,3,240,85,164,173,78,77,84,102,29,228,206,171,60,135,183,69,177,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
