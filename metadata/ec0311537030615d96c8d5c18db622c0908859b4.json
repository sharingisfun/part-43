If you listen a day late, you'll be \nfine. And even if you are used to 11:30 am / 12 noon 64k ups,\nyou'll be fine as I believe shuazien or another fan will \nbe doing earlier ups. It's been a fun ride however my pending\nschedule will simply not allow me to continue as I have been.\n\nI have also started work on a &quot;how-to&quot; of ripping audio and \ncreating torrents from it. It's looking like it will end up\nas a multi-page pdf with graphics and I will include the \n(virus-scanned) tools that I use. I want to have it done \nbefore my partial retirement - it's going to be fairly \nin-depth. \n\n\n\nFor more O&amp;A try shuazien's classic episodes:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/shuazien/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDrDumb continues The Virus with Ron and Fez:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/drdumb/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPiratebay sale may happen at the end of the month (again)!\nGet your O&amp;A here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isohunt.com/release?poster=mothergoose56&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBOOKMARK THIS IMMEDIATELY so you can get O&amp;A if/when tpb is gone.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec0311537030615d96c8d5c18db622c0908859b4","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-11-18-O%26A+CF64k+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec0311537030615d96c8d5c18db622c0908859b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,3,17,83,112,48,97,93,150,200,213,193,141,182,34,192,144,136,89,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
