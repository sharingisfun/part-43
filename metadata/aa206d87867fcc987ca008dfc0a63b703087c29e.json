DJ Ravin, who is at the helm for this issue, splits it instead into two discs entitled &quot;Dream&quot; and &quot;Joy.&quot; The first disc has a more new age, ethnic fusion feel with songs that span from the nouveau flamenco of Jesse Cook to Adrian Enescu's ethereal &quot;Invisible Movies, Pt. I,&quot; which features hypnotic vocal samples of Sheila Chandra. The second disc veers off into ecstatic territory with percussion-heavy cuts from artists like Talvin Singh and Kodo. Ekova's &quot;Starlight in Daden&quot; also appears, and Dierdre Dubois' heavenly, exotic-sounding voice fits right in with the downtempo feel of the album as a whole. While this release may not fully capture the unique energy that has made Buddha Bar known as the Studio 54 of Paris, it does present some pleasant chill-out music from a wide variety of electronic artists. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/5802/buddhabariiiatp3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/5802/buddhabariiiatp3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReleased: 2001\nGengre: Ambient/Chillout\n2 CD (Buddha's Dream - Buddha's Joy)\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nBuddha's dinner\n\n01. 3:46 Nicos / Secret love\n02. 4:10 John Kaizan Neptune / Golden lotus\n03. 3:54 Yorgos Kazantzis / Sorocos\n04. 7:17 Karunesh / Solitude\n05. 3:50 Platon Andritsakis / Via Payuta III\n06. 5:42 Tulku / Spiral dance\n07. 3:23 Manuel Franjo / Solo por tu amor\n08. 3:30 Gustavo Montesano et RPO / Tango serenato de Schubert\n09. 3:52 Adrian Enescu / Invisible movies part I\n10. 4:05 Deepak Ram / A night in lenasia\n11. 4:06 Amr Diab / Tamally maak\n12. 4:37 Frederick Rousseau / Danya\n13. 4:28 Eden / Mavis\n14. 5:10 Oliver Shanti et Friends / Sacral nirvana\n15. 6:33 Jesse Cook / On walks the night\n\nBuddah's party\n\n01. 8:18 Gotan Project / Triptico\n02. 4:59 Zeb / Sulism\n03. 4:22 Osman Ismen / Kale\n04. 7:54 Freeman / My Dear Masters\n05. 4:49 Ekova / Starlight In Daden\n06. 4:20 Talvin Singh / Veena\n07. 4:50 Ravi Prasad / Indian Gipsy\n08. 4:09 Hasan Cihat Orter / Flirting Shadows\n09. 4:35 Anna Vissy / Den Me Agapas\n10. 4:40 Nacho Sotomayor / Don't Do Anything\n11. 6:20 Badmarsh &amp; Shri / Sitar Ritual\n12. 4:56 Kodo / Strobe's Nanafushi\n13. 12:36 Livin' In Da Ghetto / Arabian Song","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa206d87867fcc987ca008dfc0a63b703087c29e","amp;dn":"Buddha+Bar+Vol.+3+%5BMp3+192++kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa206d87867fcc987ca008dfc0a63b703087c29e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,32,109,135,134,127,204,152,124,160,8,223,192,166,59,112,48,135,194,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
