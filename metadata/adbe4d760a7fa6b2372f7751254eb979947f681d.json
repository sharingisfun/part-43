Computer and network related crime is a problem that spans the globe, and unites those in two disparate fields: law enforcement and information technology.\n\nThis book will help both IT pros and law enforcement specialists understand both their own roles and those of the other, and show why that understanding and an organized, cooperative effort is necessary to win the fight against this new type of crime.\n\n62% of US companies reported computer-related security breaches resulting in damages of $124 million dollars. This data is an indication of the massive need for Cybercrime training within the IT and law enforcement communities.\nThe only book that covers Cybercrime from forensic investigation through prosecution.\nCybercrime is one of the battlefields in the war against terror.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adbe4d760a7fa6b2372f7751254eb979947f681d","amp;dn":"Scene+of+the+Cybercrime%3A+Computer+Forensics+Handbook+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adbe4d760a7fa6b2372f7751254eb979947f681d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,190,77,118,10,127,166,178,55,47,119,81,37,78,185,121,148,127,104,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
