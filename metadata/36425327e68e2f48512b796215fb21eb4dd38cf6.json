It includes their first two albums, Ramones and Leave Home, in their entirety, with the exception of &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot;, a song that was on the original release of Leave Home but was later removed from the album under pressure from the Carbona company and replaced with &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot;. Also included are a handful of bonus tracks of varying origins, including &quot;I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed&quot; and &quot;I Can't Be&quot;, which were early, previously unreleased demos; Babysitter&quot;, originally the b-side to the &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; single, was the first replacement of &quot;Carbona Not Glue&quot;; and the final two tracks, &quot;California Sun&quot; and &quot;I Don't Wanna Walk Around With You&quot;, are live recordings.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36425327e68e2f48512b796215fb21eb4dd38cf6","amp;dn":"Ramones+-+All+The+Stuff+%28And+More%29+-+Vol+1+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36425327e68e2f48512b796215fb21eb4dd38cf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,66,83,39,230,142,47,72,81,43,121,98,21,251,33,235,77,211,140,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
