And so it is with Cliff Richard, although, as The World Tour rumbles on, it's sometimes easy to forget that you are listening to (or, on the companion DVD, watching) a man who was then staring 64 in the face. Recorded during the U.K. leg of the outing in 2003, The World Tour is predictably little more than a showcase for the &quot;greatest hits live,&quot; although with around 125 U.K. chart singles to choose from, there is still plenty of room for surprise -- &quot;Born to Rock 'n' Roll,&quot; from the musical Time is one such; a sugar-sweet &quot;I Honestly Love You&quot; is another. But the highlights are those that you could list with your ears closed -- the opening flourish of &quot;We Don't Talk Anymore,&quot; an energetic blast through &quot;Move It,&quot; and a bunch of '50s rockers to prove where his heart has always been.  \n\nPersonnel: John Clark (guitar); Mike Haughton (flute, saxophone); Dave Cooke, Alan Park (keyboards); Peter May (drums); Mick Mullins, Pete Howarth, Keith Murrell (background vocals).\n\n01.
