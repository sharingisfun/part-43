As Thorton is a trained CIA operative, the tools at the player's disposal include numerous firearms, hand to hand combat using Kenpo, and spy gadgets.\n\nIn addition to the action elements, though, players also earn Advancement Points, which can be placed into any of the ten different skills in the game. These skills will increase Thorton's ability to use certain weapons and grant different abilities to him. These abilities are free to use, but require a &quot;cooldown&quot; period before they can be used again. One ability that has been mentioned in previews allows Thorton to scan a group of enemies in slow-motion before popping out of cover and shooting each of them more rapidly than he would be capable of normally.\n\n* Dialogue System :\n\nAs with any RPG, Alpha Protocol features numerous characters with whom to interact. Conversations occur in real-time, giving the player a limited amount of time to respond at key &quot;decision points&quot; during dialogue. The dialog system in the game - known as the &quot;DSS&quot; or Dialogue Stance system - allows the player to choose from three different attitudes, or &quot;stances,&quot; when speaking to an NPC. Obsidian has said that these options are based on the personalities of the &quot;three J.B.'s&quot;: Jason Bourne of the Bourne Identity novels and films, James Bond of the eponymous film and book series, and Jack Bauer of the television series 24, although the game itself does not use these names. During dialog sequences, the player will be able to choose from options like &quot;professional&quot; (Jason Bourne), &quot;suave&quot; (James Bond), and &quot;aggressive&quot; (Jack Bauer), sometimes with a brief description of the dialogue choice (such as &quot;sarcastic&quot;) taking the place of the general stance. A fourth, &quot;action&quot; dialogue choice is sometimes available, used to terminate a conversation prematurely. Each NPC will react differently to these choices; one character might be intimidated by an aggressive stance, but another character may find an aggressive stance to be insulting or childish. While dialogue choices will have some immediately noticeable consequences, many may not be seen until much later in game. As each conversation is experienced once per playthrough, multiple playthroughs will be required in order to experience all of the game's content; while the game contains a total of approximately twelve hours of cinematic sequences, a player will only experience around four hours during any given playthrough.\n\n* Structure :\n\nAlpha Protocol has a hub structure, in which Thorton must utilize safe houses in each of his hub cities in order to lay low between missions. From a safe house, Thorton can change clothing, access a weapons locker, telephone contacts, and attempt missions. Some missions are critical to the progression of the story, while others are optional. Players will be able to buy and sell weapons and equipment within their safe houses. Hub cities include Rome, Moscow, Taipei and a city inside Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n============================\n  \nCPU: 2.4+ GHZ IntelÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or 2.0+ GHZ AMDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢   \nRAM: 1 GB RAM (Windows XPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®,) 2 GB RAM (Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®)   \nVGA: NVIDIAÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® GeForce 6 series (6800GT or better,) ATIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 1300XT series or greater (X1550, X1600 Pro and HD2400 are below minimum system requirements)  \nDX: DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c   \nOS: Microsoft Windows XPÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® or Windows VistaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®   \nHDD: At least 12 GB of free space  \nSound: DirectXÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® 9.0c compatible sound card and drivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                ***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8f1896c5eb45ff9321f987511c6f30e3160bf6","amp;dn":"PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+ALPHA+PROTOCOL+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb8f1896c5eb45ff9321f987511c6f30e3160bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,143,24,150,197,235,69,255,147,33,249,135,81,28,111,48,227,22,11,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
