The soundtrack stands out as one of the greatest jazz film scores ever issued. Everything was recorded live. This reissue also features a bonus track, from Dexter Gordon's Homecoming: Live At The Village Vanguard (Columbia, 1976).\n\nAs the lead character, Gordon interprets &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and a few other pieces that provide appropriate impressions for the story. His acting and playing go hand in hand. Gordon's tenor places Lester Young in the ear and mind's eye of the audience. Billy Higgins and Herbie Hancock anchor a session high in quality and filled with emotion. When the script calls for something eerie, they provide it. By inverting the harmonic structure of Bud Powell's &quot;Time Waits,&quot; Hancock creates &quot;Still Time,&quot; which moves soothingly along a fairy-tale path. Daydreams and nightmares come and go, while an all-star jazz cast provides the charm. A twin-tenor battle with Wayne Shorter, a hard bop quintet romp with Freddie Hubbard, and several classic ballads form a memorable soundtrack. As well as paying homage to pioneers Powell and Young, the film's music serves as a tribute to many other bebop, hard bop, and post-bop innovators.
