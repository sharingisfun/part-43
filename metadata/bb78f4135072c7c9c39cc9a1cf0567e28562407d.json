In an attempt to make the world their own, they have undertaken to convert the EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s atmosphere into one more to their liking--unfortunately, the result will be the death of all of humanity.  A lone wander, Slash Maraud is reluctantly caught up in a resistance movement to stop the conversion process and overthrow the alien invaders.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb78f4135072c7c9c39cc9a1cf0567e28562407d","amp;dn":"Slash+Maraud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb78f4135072c7c9c39cc9a1cf0567e28562407d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,120,244,19,80,114,199,201,195,156,201,161,207,5,103,226,133,98,64,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
