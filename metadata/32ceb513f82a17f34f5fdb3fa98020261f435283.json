What if? What if?\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an interesting question. What if Robert Johnson had access to an electric guitar and a four track machine? What if Janis Joplin had put down the Southern Comfort and entered rehab? What if Jeff Buckley hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t gone for that last, dip in the Mississippi? What if, what if, what if?\n\nThe interesting thing about this particular soundtrack to a 20-year old film noir movie you maybe never saw, is that it answers a profound What If. To be precise: What if the greatest jazz musician of the 20th century teamed on an album with the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest blues musicians? \n\nHereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s your answer.\n\nThe Hot Spot blends Miles DavisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lonely blue trumpet, with John Lee HookerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moans and machine-gun electric guitar, Taj MahalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s country guitar picking, and Roy RogerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s peerless slide guitar. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a musical Dream Team of sorts and the potential is staggering. Each of these artists is an icon in his own right. How do they blend together?\n\nTo be honest, the results are mixed. There are some absolute standout songs here, a few choice tracks that merit you rushing down to your local record store and buying this album straightaway: Bank Robbery, for instance, is the pitch-perfect blend of jazz and blues, a hard driving blend, equal parts sophisticated bop and raw blasts of juke joint guitar. There are moments of absolute, jaw-dropping beauty, in which each artist displays their trademark style without smothering anyone elseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sound. \n\nSometimes however, The Hot Spot is also a missed opportunity of sorts. The key reason is, frequently, too much John Lee Hooker. While being a great musician, his guitar and field moans cast a long shadow on some of these tracks. \n\nSome of the tracks are also nearly indistinguishable from one another, so if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re expecting a wildly varying concept album, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll probably come away disappointed. Though this soundtrack contains 13 songs, the Hot Spot is essentially a super long run 6-track EP. View it that way, and you shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be disappointed. \n\nIf your tastes run more to jazz than blues, you might also be underwhelmed, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inevitable when you pair three blues guitarist with one jazz trumpeter, even when that trumpet player is Miles Davis.\n\nStill, the Hot Spot is an enjoyable (if relatively uniform) musical footnote at times, the perfect marriage of blues and jazz. Odds are good that it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be on record store shelves forever. That, of course, may be the saddest aspect of this story. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll always be able to find a copy of Michael Jackson at your local record store, but the Hot Spot probably wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t live out the end of this decade. \n\nGet it while itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still hot. \n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Lee Hooker (acoustic &amp; electric guitars, vocals); \nTaj Majal (acoustic &amp; electric guitars, vocals); \nRoy Rogers (slide guitar); \nMiles Davis (trumpet); \nBradford Ellis (keyboards); \nTim Drummond (bass); \nEarl Palmer (drums).\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n 01  Coming to Town \n 02  Empty Bank  \n 03  Harry's Philosophy\n 04  Dolly's Arrival \n 05  Harry and Dolly \n 06  Sawmill \n 07  Bank Robbery \n 08  Moanin' Blues \n 09  Gloria's Story \n 10  Harry Sets Up \n 11  Murder  \n 12  Blackmail  \n 13  End Credits  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ceb513f82a17f34f5fdb3fa98020261f435283","amp;dn":"Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+-+The+Hot+Spot++%5B1990%5D++%5BRobb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ceb513f82a17f34f5fdb3fa98020261f435283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,206,181,19,248,42,23,243,79,95,219,63,169,128,32,38,31,67,82,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
