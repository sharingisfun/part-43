With such a continued interest in Jett's music,\n\nthe musician felt it was finally an appropriate time to release a\n\ndefinitive Greatest Hits album. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFans have been asking me for years and\n\nyears for a new Greatest Hits album. There has always been interest,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nsaid the musician. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut, over the past few years I have been executive\n\nproducing a film about my first band, the Runaways. In the process, I\n\nrevisited the music and have really been living with it. It made me\n\nrealize that it would be great to get it back out into the market place\n\nfor the fans and for a new audience.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n\nJust prior to the major motion picture The Runaways hits theatres, this 2\n\nCD set and 2 LP set serves as both a new, definitive, Joan Jett Best Of\n\nalbum and as a companion soundtrack the film. The album includes 7 songs\n\nfeatured in the film, 1 previously unreleased track, all of the hits\n\nre-mastered, and re-recordings of several Runaways favourites.\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n\n\nDISC 1:\n\n01.
