The artificial intelligence used is known as an Artificial Neural Network, a computer program loosely based on the design of the human brain and known for its learning capability. Several damage cases are analysis and tested to train the Neural Network after which, given a set of inputs, it has the capability of predicting the state and location of the damage in a bridge deck. This book represents a perfect introduction to the basic theory and practicality of using Neural Networks in engineering applications. It furthers this concept by applying the mathematical theory into a feasible and practical tool for practicing engineers.\nAbout the Author\nSimon Mitton studied Structural Engineering with Architecture in University College Dublin. His main field of interest lies in bridge engineering where he has already undertaken 2 major research projects by the age of 23, one of which is contain in the book and the other in the dynamics of cables of cable-stayed structures.\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 64 pages\nPublisher: LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing (February 13, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 3838388836\nISBN-13: 978-3838388830\nProduct Dimensions: 8.7 x 5.9 x 0.2 inches\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Damage-Detection-Bridge-Artificial-Networks/dp/3838388836/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298321733&amp;sr=1-8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Damage-Detection-Bridge-Artificial-Networks/dp/3838388836/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1298321733&amp;sr=1-8&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca01abea3967278daabaf9ce9c23d58c843ba61e","amp;dn":"Engineering+-+Neural+Network+Damage+Detect+in+Bridges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca01abea3967278daabaf9ce9c23d58c843ba61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,1,171,234,57,103,39,141,170,186,249,206,156,35,213,140,132,59,166,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
