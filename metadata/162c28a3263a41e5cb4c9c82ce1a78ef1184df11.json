Unfortunately for Harry, his chosen nemesis is also the town's matchmaker, and he needs George to broker the marriage of his dim but handsome son, Gus (Cillian Murphy). Being indebted to George only fuels Harry's irrational hatred more. But somehow, no matter how hard he schemes to bedevil George, Harry proves to be his own worst enemy.
