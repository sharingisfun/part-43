Roy is able to understand the unintelligible speech of Michael Connolly, who was left in the shelter by his prominent father many years ago due to his cerebral palsy, and they become close friends. Rory convinces Michael to move from Carrigmore to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the gorgeous Siobhan to assist them. Living together with Rory, Michael faces a new world, finding friendship, love and freedom and learning to survive by his own.\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nThis film was amazing, it was extremely funny and moving. Damien O'Donnell and Jeffrey Caine have put together a great movie which will appeal to all ages. James McAvoy and Steven Robertson made this film brilliant. Their acting was excellent, there was this real lifelike feeling between them, that made you really believe they were the characters they were acting out. Romola Garai is amazingly gorgeous and brilliant in her role. The story of these two physically challenged people and their carer is well put over, and you really start to grow to know and feel for the characters as the movie goes on, it was especially upsetting at the end. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves a truly heart felt movie, warning to the more sensitive viewer make sure you have tissues you will need them.\nAgain amazing film!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ec67627dd59f8ff6b5581c652479bfe2044a17f","amp;dn":"Inside+Im+Dancing+-+%282004%29%28James+McAvoy%29%5BDvdRip-Divx-English%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ec67627dd59f8ff6b5581c652479bfe2044a17f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,198,118,39,221,89,248,255,107,85,129,198,82,71,155,254,32,68,161,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
