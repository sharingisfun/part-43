It includes only 15 tracks, 9 cars and 4 weapons, but still is pretty fun nonetheless. This has singe player modes, but even those are heavily based on modern multiplayer. Multiplayer is available up to 6 players and it can be played through GameSpy.\n\nSystem requirements:\nOperating System - XP (I believe that it can work on lower OS, too)\nVideo Card - 32 MB\nRam - 128 MB\nCPU - 800 GHz\n\nNote: I\\'m uploading this only because it couldn\\'t be found here (at least with seeders), nor on other websites. This is NOT my rip, nor is the crack. (Although I do possess a Russian version of this game)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8df7c1a1888265be9a40b811cd113a408bccd1cb","amp;dn":"Bumper+Wars+%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8df7c1a1888265be9a40b811cd113a408bccd1cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,247,193,161,136,130,101,190,154,64,184,17,205,17,58,64,139,204,209,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
