Fenton Robinson never did quite fit the &quot;Genuine Houserocking Music&quot; image of Alligator Records -- his deep, rich baritone sounds more like a magic carpet than a piece of barbed wire, and he speaks in jazz-inflected tongues, full of complex surprises. The title track hits with amazing power, as do the chugging &quot;The Getaway,&quot; a hard-swinging &quot;You Say You're Leaving,&quot; and the minor-key &quot;You Don't Know What Love Is.&quot; In every case, Robinson had recorded them before, but thanks to Bruce Iglauer's superb production, a terrific band, and Robinson's musicianship, these versions reign supreme.\n\n\nRecorded at Sound Studios, Chicago, Illinois\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
