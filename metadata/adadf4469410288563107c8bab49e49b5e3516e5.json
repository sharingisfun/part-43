Todd or 'Troy' and company opened for a bevy of acts such as, Johnny Winter, Robin Trower, The Neville Bros., Son Seals, Dickey Betts, Omar &amp; the Howlers, Gregg Allman, The Outlaws, Smithereens, Zebra, and his first opener back in 1980 , Albert Collins! Todd decided to head west in 1990 to write and record a demo with a then unknown backup singer named Sheryl Crow. After having that demo passed on by some major labels and not generating much interest after one show case performance, Todd decided to stay in Los Angeles to record and tour with former Textone, Carla Olson. Todd continued to record and perform with Carla and gig with his own blues trio and kept busy scoring soundtracks for the Playboy Channel. Sheryl in the meantime, had finished her first album, 'Tuesday Night Music Club' and needed a guitarist for her touring band which she put together in June of 1993 so, Todd came on board and remained until February of 1998. \n\nTracklisting:\n\n01.
