Erik Marcus has written what is said to be the most informative introduction to veganism, and we'd have to agree wholeheartedly. &quot;Veganism: The New Ethics of Eating&quot; is by far one of the greatest resources to have in your vegan library, covering such topics as animal compassion, health, and the inevitable environmental crisis that will come if the world does not work toward removing meat and dairy from the main course of it's every meal. An excellent read packed full into 228 pages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7204804f635bb2c975232dd02a22a26b26b3b07b","amp;dn":"Erik+Marcus+-+Vegan+-+The+New+Ethics+of+Eating.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7204804f635bb2c975232dd02a22a26b26b3b07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,4,128,79,99,91,178,201,117,35,45,208,42,34,162,107,38,179,176,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
