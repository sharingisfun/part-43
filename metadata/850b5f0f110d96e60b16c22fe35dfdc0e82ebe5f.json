They are bored of royal luxuries. They want to get back to the days of adventure they had enjoyed all their lives, but their age comes in the way. They leave the kingdom in search of new experiences. Finally, they reach Anandagarh and win the king's heart with their music. In the court room they meet Brahmananda Acharya, who invites Goopy and Bagha to come to Anandagarh fort. When they go to his place he offers them a job to steal three valuable stones, making use of their miraculous powers gifted by Bhuter Raja (King of Ghosts). In return he promises to make them 20 years younger. They stole two rare stones with a hope to become young again. But then in their dream the King of Ghost appears and advises them to keep off injustice. They apologise to him and return the stones to the respective owners. Brahmananda Acharya had gained immense powers, as shown when he was not rendered motionless when they sung in front of the court. But, due to his greed of gaining rare and valuable stones, he was not offered immortality. It was foretold that a 12 year boy, named Bikram, with divine powers, would defeat him. To prevent his death, Brahmananda Acharya had all the boys in Anandagarh, who were 12 years old and were named Bikram, kidnapped by his soldiers. He hypnotized them, making them his servants. In the end, Goopy and Bagha found out that one boy named Kanu was previously named Bikram.an He was to receive divine powers at the age of 12. He, along with Goopy d Bagha, went to Anandagarh fort. There, as Bikram came close to Brahmananda Acharya, Acharya sank beneath the ground, signifying that he had been destroyed. His valuable stones also vanished.
