But can U. S. forces succeed in a land long known as the &quot;graveyard of empires?&quot; FRONTLINE producers Martin Smith (&quot;Beyond Baghdad,&quot; &quot;Return of the Taliban&quot;) and Marcela Gaviria (&quot;In Search of Al Qaeda&quot;) once again make the dangerous journey to the front lines of America's biggest fight. Through interviews with the top U.S. commanders on the ground, embeds with U.S. forces and fresh reporting from Washington, Smith and Gaviria examine U.S. counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- a fight that promises to be longer and more costly than most Americans understand. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 20s 714ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 004 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32879bc329b9b73d676ccff1474687b43e238217","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline-Obama%5C%27s+War.S28E01.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32879bc329b9b73d676ccff1474687b43e238217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,135,155,195,41,185,183,61,103,108,207,241,71,70,135,180,62,35,130,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
