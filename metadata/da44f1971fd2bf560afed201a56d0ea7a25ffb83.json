Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers).\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tNaive\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Down From Dover\n02.Hold On Hold On\n03.Solitude\n04.The Crane Wife 3\n05.Easy Come Easy Go\n06.Children Of Stone\n07.How Many Worlds\n08.In Germany Before The War\n09.O O Baby\n10.Sing Me Back Home\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Salvation\n02.Black Coffee\n03.The Phoenix.\n04.Dear God Please Help Me\n05.Kimbie\n06.Many A Mile To Freedom\n07.Somewhere (A Place For Us)\n08.Flandyke Shore\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da44f1971fd2bf560afed201a56d0ea7a25ffb83","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+Easy+Come+Easy+Go+%282008%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da44f1971fd2bf560afed201a56d0ea7a25ffb83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,68,241,151,31,210,191,86,10,254,210,1,165,109,14,167,162,95,251,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
