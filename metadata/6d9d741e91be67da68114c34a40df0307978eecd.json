It was set in the men's and women's departments of Grace Brothers, a large, fictional London department store. It was written mainly by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, with contributions by Michael Knowles and John Chapman. The idea for the show came from Lloyd's brief period working at Simpsons of Piccadilly in the early 1950s, a clothing store which traded for over 60 years until 1999.\n\nAre You Being Served? featured humour based on sexual innuendo, misunderstandings, mistaken identity and occasional slapstick. In addition, there were sight gags generated by outrageous costumes which the characters were sometimes required to wear for store promotions, and gaudy store displays frequently featuring malfunctioning robotic mannequins. The show is remembered for its prolific use of double entendres.\n\nThe main humorous base of the series was a merciless parody of the British class system.This permeated almost every interaction and was especially evident in the conversations between the maintenance men and the ostensibly higher-class store personnel.The episodes rarely left the store, and to parody the stereotype of the British class system, characters rarely addressed each other by their given names, even after work. When they did, it was almost always for a comical effect.\n\nThe main characters included stereotypes as the effeminate Mr. Humphries, who lived with his mother; Captain Peacock, the haughty floorwalker who purportedly fought in the North Africa Campaign of World War II (but was actually in the Service Corps and was never in a combat situation); the snobbish and boisterous Mrs. Slocombe with her ever-changing hair colour; Miss Shirley Brahms, a young, attractive, working-class, cockney-speaking junior assistant to Mrs. Slocombe; Mr Rumbold, the autocratic, obsequious (to young Mr Grace), easily confused section manager; Mr Lucas, the young, money-less, woman-chasing junior salesman; and young Mr Grace, the very old, rich, woman-catching store owner.\nThe show spawned the catch phrase &quot;Are you free?&quot;, usually said by Captain Peacock to the staff; more often than not, the staff are noticeably free, and each would look solemnly from side to side before answering, &quot;Yes, I'm free, Captain Peacock.&quot; John Inman remarked, when Mr. Humphries trilled, &quot;I'm free!&quot;, it became his own personal catchphrase. Another recurring catch phrase was &quot;they'll ride up with wear&quot;, about the length of pairs of trousers or sleeves of jackets that were sold. In fact it was used to justify selling anything that did not fit the customer.\n\nDuring its run, the series attracted some mild criticism for its reliance on sexual stereotypes and sexual double entendres, including jokes about Mrs. Slocombe's &quot;pussy&quot; (cat) e.g. Mrs Slocombe: &quot;Animals are very psychic; the least sign of danger and my pussy's hair stands on end&quot;. John Inman's camp portrayal of Mr. Humphries as an effeminate man could easily be misinterpreted by viewers. Inman pointed out that Mr. Humphries' true sexual orientation was never explicitly stated in the series, and David Croft said in an interview that the character was not homosexual, but &quot;just a mother's boy&quot;. With a broad mixture of stereotypical gay characteristics, some apparent heterosexual attractions, and always picking up on ambiguous words such as 'queen', 'gay' and 'camp', viewers were left wondering about Mr. Humphries' sexual orientation. In an episode of the spin-off Grace &amp; Favour, the character is further described as neither a &quot;woman's man&quot; nor a &quot;man's man&quot; and as being &quot;in limbo&quot;.\nThe characters sometimes broke the fourth wall for a comical effect.\n\nAre You Being Served? was first broadcast on 8 September 1972 on the BBC, in the form of a pilot for the series Comedy Playhouse. It only aired when it did because of free airspace created by the Munich massacre during the 1972 Summer Olympics. The pilot was reshown at the beginning of the first series on 14 March 1973. That first series was aired in the same timeslot as Coronation Street on ITV, and consequently received relatively little attention. However, repeats shown later in the year were much more successful.[3] Although the pilot was produced in colour, only a black-and-white version of this episode remains.\nThe show went on to receive huge audiences, with later episodes attracting up to 22 million viewers. After 10 series, 69 episodes and a 13-year run, Are You Being Served? came to an end on 1 April 1985.\nIn addition, the cast performed in character for a stage sketch on the BBC1 programme Variety on 19 June 1976.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9d741e91be67da68114c34a40df0307978eecd","amp;dn":"Are+You+Being+Served%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d9d741e91be67da68114c34a40df0307978eecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,157,116,30,145,190,103,218,104,17,76,52,164,13,240,48,121,120,238,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
