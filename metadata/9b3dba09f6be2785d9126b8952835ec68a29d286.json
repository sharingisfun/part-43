It has Bash 4.1.0, Syslinux 4.03, and e2fsprogs 1.41.14, the latest from Ubuntu Natty. It now has JWM 500, up from 493.  Gnumeric 1.10.13 is a necessity because our very own yarddog had posted a bug to Gnumeric that is corrected in 1.0.13.   Lucid 5.25 uses the Woof of FEB 28 replacing the Woof of NOV 28 for 3 months of progress in Woof development. All of the favorite Puppy programs are there in their latest versions. Check out Pburn by zigbert which now compares favorably with Nero Linux. Gnome-mplayer 1.02 compiled by our own ttuuxxx is a substantial improvement and now works well with both the Openbox and JWM window managers. All this and the the low overhead that makes Puppy fast.
