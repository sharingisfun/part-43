Over 600 works from the artist were on display, and numerous fans flocked to the one-of-a-kind exhibition celebrating the lush, gorgeous background artwork typifying many a work from Miyazaki Hayao and other Ghibli filmmakers. International fans of Oga and Studio Ghibli have not been left out, however. The Oga Kazuo Exhibition: Ghibli No Eshokunin - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest (Blu-ray + DVD) allows fans the opportunity to attend the exhibition, as well as watch interviews and testimonials with Oga's contemporaries and collaborators, all subtitled in English.\n\nThe set includes a Blu-ray disc and DVD, both sharing much of the same content, with the Blu-ray disc having the added benefit of true High-Definition presentation. Shared features between the two discs include: a slideshow of all 600 works on display at the exhibition; the 72-minute feature &quot;Ghibli's Oga Kazuo, who painted Totoro's woods&quot;; and a 40-minute featurette containing interviews with director Takahata Isao, art scholar Tsuji Nobuo, Ghibli art department head Tanaka Naoya, and art director Kobayashi Shichiro.\n\nThe DVD also contains a 20-minute feature detailing Oga Kazuo's creative process, as he paints the cover for a 2005 art book collecting his paintings. The same feature shows up on the Blu-ray disc, except extended to 35 minutes. The Blu-ray disc also includes an exclusive feature with Oga creating the cover painting for the Blu-ray disc release, shot and presented in HD to take full advantage of the next generation video format. For fans of both painted art and Ghibli Studios, the Oga Kazuo Exhibition represents an uncommon and fascinating glimpse into the mind of a master.\n\nRip &amp; encode: neo1024\nYear: 2007\nCategories: Documentary\nJapanese title: ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¹Ã‚Â¿ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã…â€™ÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃ¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ : Ghibli ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚Â¹Ã¢â‚¬Â¹ÃƒÂ§Ã‚Â¹Ã‚ÂªÃƒÂ¨Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â·ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚ÂºÃ‚Âº- ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â«ÃƒÂ¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ã‚ÂºÃƒÂ©Ã‚Â¾Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â²Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â£Ã‚Â®ÃƒÂ¦Ã…Â¾Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ§Ã…Â¡Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ÃƒÂ¤Ã‚ÂºÃ‚Âº (Blu-ray + DVD) (ÃƒÂ¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â±ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â­Ã¢â‚¬â€ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚Â¹Ã¢â‚¬Â¢) (ÃƒÂ¦Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã‚Â¥ÃƒÂ¦Ã…â€œÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‹â€ )\nRelated torrents: DVD version, 720p version, The Art of Studio Ghibli\n\n\nTechnical info:\nOga Kazuo - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest - 1 - The Exhibition\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 3000kbps\nAudio: 2 Japanese tracks in AC3 @ 384kbps - with and without commentary\nSubs: English and Japanese DVD VobSub converted from SUP\nRunning time: 1h 12m\nMD5: A4628970E61C0DDFE481B6B4EDAD4709\nCRC: CF4E9D91\n\nOga Kazuo - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest - 2 - Interviews\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 3000kbps\nAudio: Japanese, AC3 @ 384 kbps\nSubs: English and Japanese DVD VobSub converted from SUP\nRunning time: 40m 40s\nMD5: A0B9B9302D9578727E55C6DBA1658430\nCRC: 470F5973\n\nOga Kazuo - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest - 3 - Painting a Background\nVideo: x264, 640x480 @ 2800kbps\nAudio: Music, AC3 @ 384kbps\nSubs: No subtitles (if anyone is up to the task, you are welcome to translate a few Kanji hardsubbed instructions)\nRunning time: 34m 50s\nMD5: 20217603373155AA6DBD378C67783EDD\nCRC: 0060DCF8\n\nOga Kazuo - The One Who Painted Totoro's Forest - 4 - At the Master's Workshop\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 3000kbps\nAudio: Japanese, AC3 @ 384kbps\nSubs: English and Japanese DVD VobSub converted from SUP\nRunning time: 24m 09s\nMD5: F6C0758B1355045F38CC98A745F8D8B3\nCRC: 49CFF4F6\n\n\n\nOga Kazuo Slideshow - Chapter 1 - Background - From Tube to Screen\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 2500kbps\nAudio: None\nSubs: None\nRunning time: 10m 16s\nMD5: 98C5B738ED33CAC1364AA3D53AF8FDBD\nCRC: 3D2AD452\n\nOga Kazuo Slideshow - Chapter 2 - Projection - Projected Imagination on Studio Ghibli's Works\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 2500kbps\nAudio: None\nSubs: None\nRunning time: 36m 33s\nMD5: 7AED73E3D27657A9013F8BCBBA583CE4\nCRC: 00C5787C\n\nOga Kazuo Slideshow - Chapter 3 - Reflection - Off the Screen\nVideo: x264, 1920x1080 @ 2500kbps\nAudio: None\nSubs: None\nRunning time: 7m 07s\nMD5: 473707C3D4AAC0B2091BB81A08CB4F03\nCRC: 86DCC082\n\nA few notes: Over 600 high definition images, mentioned in the description above were added to The Art of Studio Ghibli torrent.
