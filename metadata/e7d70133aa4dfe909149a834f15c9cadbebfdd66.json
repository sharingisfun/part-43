David is born in England in about 1820. David's father had died six months before he was born, and seven years later, his mother marries Mr Edward Murdstone. David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Mr Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Mr Murdstone thrashes David for falling behind with his studies. Following one of these thrashings, David bites him and is sent away to a boarding school, Salem House, with a ruthless headmaster, Mr. Creakle. Here he befriends James Steerforth and Tommy Traddles, both of whom he meets again later on.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(novel)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7d70133aa4dfe909149a834f15c9cadbebfdd66","amp;dn":"Charles+Dickens+-+David+Copperfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7d70133aa4dfe909149a834f15c9cadbebfdd66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,215,1,51,170,77,254,144,145,73,168,52,241,92,156,173,190,191,221,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
