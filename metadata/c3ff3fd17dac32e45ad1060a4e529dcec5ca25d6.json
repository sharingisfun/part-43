There are the irresistible grooves of &quot;Tin Tin Deo&quot; and the curiously titled &quot;Whiffenpoof Song&quot;. The former is a different arrangement of Dizzy's original. Tjader originals &quot;Daddy Wong Legs&quot; and &quot;Soul Motion&quot; will get your fingers snapping too. An additional Tjader original, the straight ahead jazz of &quot;The Prophet&quot; shows just how much Tjader could swing. Finally, the exquisite mid tempo &quot;Reza&quot; will put you in a romantic mood. Discover the other gems with open ears. Like other geniuses, Cal Tjader made the very difficult appear easy. Composing, arranging and interpreting at a very high level throughout his legendary career, Tjader is a true one of a kind. Accompanied by his usual cast of stellar musicians including Johnny Rae, Armando Peraza and Terry Hilliard, this record only gets better with listening. Long Live Cal Tjader! ~ James W.
