The title was released in the fall of 1948 by B&amp;I Publishing (later known as American Comics Group) and enjoyed a run of 174 issues over a nearly twenty year period, ceasing publication in August 1967.  Though not the first horror comic published, Adventures was the first horror comic to enjoy regularly scheduled publication.  In comparison with other horror titles of the period, Adventures Into the Unknown was somewhat restrained in its depiction of violence and gore.  B&amp;I based the book on traditional prose ghost stories, rather than radio drama or earlier comics, with the first issue featuring an adaptation of Horace Walpole's eighteenth century gothic novel The Castle of Otranto.  Adventures Into the Unknown was a popular success.  Unlike many horror comics of the Golden Age, it weathered the public criticism of the early 1950s and survived the aftermath of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings of 1954 when the comics industry attempted self-regulation with a highly restrictive Comics Code.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90e996effc0b2fd5050c1516d589193d608a5825","amp;dn":"Adventures+Into+The+Unknown+%28ACG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90e996effc0b2fd5050c1516d589193d608a5825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,233,150,239,252,11,47,213,5,12,21,22,213,137,25,61,96,138,88,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
