He was one of the great masters of Romantic music.\nChopin was born in the village of Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â»elazowa Wola, in the Duchy of Warsaw, to a French-expatriate father and Polish mother, and in his early life was regarded as a child-prodigy pianist. In November 1830, at the age of twenty, he went abroad; following the suppression of the Polish November Uprising of 1830ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1831, he became one of many expatriates of the Polish &quot;Great Emigration.&quot;\nIn Paris, Chopin made a comfortable living as a composer and piano teacher, while giving few public performances. Though an ardent Polish patriot, in France he used the French versions of his names and eventually, to avoid having to rely on Imperial Russian documents, became a French citizen. After some ill-fated romantic involvements with Polish women, from 1837 to 1847 he had a turbulent relationship with the French writer George Sand (Aurore Dudevant). Always in frail health, he died in Paris in 1849, at the age of thirty-nine, of chronic pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\nChopin's extant compositions were written primarily for the piano as a solo instrument. Though they are technically demanding, his style emphasises nuance and expressive depth. Chopin invented musical forms such as the ballade and was responsible for major innovations in forms such as the piano sonata, mazurka, waltz, nocturne, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tude, impromptu and prÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lude. His works are masterpieces and mainstays of Romanticism in 19th-century classical music.\n\nNikita Magaloff (Born Magalashvili) (21 February (old style 8 February), 1912 - 26 December 1992) was a Georgian-Russian pianist.\n\nHe was born to a Georgian noble family in St. Petersburg. Magaloff and his family left Russia in 1918 for Finland and then Paris, where he studied with Isidor Philipp. He also numbered Ravel and Prokofiev among his friends there.\n\nHe was best known for his espousal of the music of Chopin, recording the complete piano works - the first time anyone had done so. While these recordings have been criticised for their failure to plumb the depths of Chopin's works, they were innovative for their textual fidelity and unsentimentality. Magaloff, for example, preferred and recorded Chopin's own manuscript versions of the valses rather than the familiar versions published posthumously by Julian Fontana.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
