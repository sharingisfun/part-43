Although heavily marketed the game proved too difficult for many gamers. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good game here ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just simply hidden under many layers of frustration.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The late Phil Hartman had voiced Captain Blasto, an extremely muscular, alien-fighting, dimwitted captain whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always in the mood for a babe from any solar system most specifically in the Planet Uranus.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe game was a third-person action/platform/shooter. The enemies are aliens that teleport in around the player based on events that are triggered as the player explores the environment. The game had a strong platform element with elements such as rotating 3D sections which have to be navigated while shooting at aliens. Puzzle elements tend to be limited to simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFind The Switch To ProceedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ scenarios. However, some of the elements within the game require the player to utilize different weaponry in certain situations in order to advance to the next area.\n\nPLOT:\nAfter returning from the 5th dimension, a diabolical tyrant alien named Bosc is bent on conquering the Planet Uranus with his own army and attempts to invade and destroy Earth as well. He is seeking to reign supreme for his power of the solar system that includes his alien army capturing and enslaving the Space Babes throughout the galaxy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dddf9c581840813be910ce02a8a92e06f67a558","amp;dn":"Blasto+%28PSX%29+%28PS1%29+%28Action%29+%28Adventure%29+%28Use+ePSXe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dddf9c581840813be910ce02a8a92e06f67a558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,221,249,197,129,132,8,19,190,145,12,224,42,138,146,224,111,103,165,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
