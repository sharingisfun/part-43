After their split, Simon's solo career took off, peaking with the multi-award winning Graceland in 1986.\nIn the 1960s Simon and Garfunkel (originally known as Tom &amp; Jerry) released a series of successful albums which spawned a slew of hit singles including &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;, &quot;Mrs Robinson&quot; and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;. Their final album Bridge Over Troubled Water was released in 1970, but with their friendship failing under the pressures of fame, they split after its release. Their relationship has endured, albeit falteringly, and they have reformed for several pivotal concerts, including a free concert in Rome in 2004 which attracted an audience of over half a million.\nHowever, Simon has almost always maintained a creative career outside of the duo and has recorded many songs on his own or with other musicians. In the period between Tom &amp; Jerry and before Simon and Garfunkel hit the big time (1957-1964), he recorded several songs under pseudonyms including Jerry Landis, Paul Kane and True Taylor, and enjoyed some success as part of the group Tico and the Triumphs. He also began to produce singles and write songs for other people including The Seekers.\nIn the period after Simon and Garfunkel he began to write and record solo material starting with Paul Simon (1972) and including the well considered Still Crazy After All These Years (1975), which contained the US chart-topper &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;. For a while he coupled his songwriting and recording with acting and appeared in Annie Hall, among other films. His career ebbed a little in the early 1980s, but the release of the highly acclaimed and Grammy-winning Graceland in 1986 marked a return to popularity. He consolidated this with the release of The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990. His most recent release has been Surprise (2006) which he produced with the help of Brian Eno.\n\n\n\n\nThere Goes Rhymin' Simon is the third studio album by American musician Paul Simon, released on May 5, 1973. It was his most rushed-released studio album. It contains songs covering several styles and genres, such as gospel (&quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot;) and dixieland (&quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot;). It received two nominations at the Grammy Awards of 1974, including Best Male Pop Vocal performance and Album of the Year. It was ranked #267 on the list of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nAs foreshadowed by the good-feel lead single &quot;Kodachrome&quot; (which reached #2 on the Billboard charts, blocked by Billy Preston's &quot;Will It Go Round in Circles&quot;), There Goes Rhymin' Simon proved to be a bigger hit than its predecessor, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200 chart (kept off the top spot by George Harrison's Living in the Material World), and #1 on Cashbox Magazine for one week on June 30, 1973. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at #4. Subsequent singles were also the #2 single &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot; (knocked-off by Cher's &quot;Half-Breed&quot;, but reaching #1 on Cashbox on September 29, 1973), and the Top 40 hit &quot;American Tune&quot;. Also &quot;Take Me to the Mardi Gras&quot; was released in the UK reaching the Top 20.\nThe song &quot;Kodachrome&quot; is named after the Kodak film of the same name. Kodak required the album to note that Kodachrome is a trademark of Kodak. The song was not released as a single in Britain, where it could not be played on BBC radio due to its trademarked name. The song &quot;Was a Sunny Day&quot; has an interesting reference to early rock and roll in the line &quot;She called him Speedo but his Christian name was Mr. Earl&quot; which echos the chorus from the 1955 song from The Cadillacs &quot;Speedo&quot;, with &quot;others call him Speedo but his real name is Mr. Earl&quot;, their lead singer, Earl &quot;Speedo&quot; Carroll.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nPaul Simon - vocals, guitar\nThe Dixie Hummingbirds - vocals\nBob James - keyboards\nQuincy Jones - string arrangements\nGrady Tate - drums\nPete Carr - guitar\nBob Cranshaw - bass\nAirto Moreira - percussion\nBarry Beckett - piano, vibraphone\nCornell Dupree - guitar\nDon Elliott - vibraphone\nGordon Edwards - bass\nAlexander Gafa - guitar\nPaul Griffin - piano\nRoger Hawkins - drums, percussion\nDavid Hood - bass\nRev.
