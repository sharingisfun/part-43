They're joined by expert Tim Barks.\n\nIn the yellow overalls are &quot;The Mule Wrights&quot; from the U.S. consisting of Ray, Rick and Carlos. They're joined by British expert Nigel Morris.\n\nThe challenge : build a 5 ton monster truck.\n\n(Although in sync, the video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies). V6/A10  (From season 5x02 onwards, they're V10 / A10)\n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s. \n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them. \n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part.\n\nCreating a torrent takes seconds, uploading them takes ages. I'm going to create all episodes of season 4 &amp; seed 1 by 1, stopping at about 98% until a whole heap of you are ready to finish, saving me the hassle of constantly seeding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3cb36a1004f71cc864c79cc12845b8e46019624","amp;dn":"Scrapheap+Challenge+-+04x02+-+Monster+Truck.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3cb36a1004f71cc864c79cc12845b8e46019624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,203,54,161,0,79,113,204,134,76,121,204,18,132,91,142,70,1,150,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
