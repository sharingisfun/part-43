IMDB list it  \n   as a 2007 production, but its actually 2008.         \n   Unfortunately the RETAIL DVD has hardcored Greek     \n   subs, but the movie language is English. Also you    \n   may notice that in some parts of the movie, it may   \n   look like its uncropped on the left/right side, its  \n   because of some of the videos the director used, so  \n   if we cropped more, we'd cut a lot of picture from   \n   the main movie.                                      \n                                                        \n                                                      \n                                              \n                     \n                                      \n                  g r o u p  n e w s       \n                         a n d               \n                   g r e e t s              \n                                                         \n                  2010 and the Greek Alcoholics are still around   \n                   We are always looking for the following :        \n                   - Unreleased movies/games/music/apps etc          \n                    - People working in Greek cinemas                 \n                    - People working in Greek distribution companies  \n                    - TV cappers who can record Greek TV shows        \n                    - Experienced games/applications crackers         \n                    - 10mbit+ sites for XviD/mp3 affiliation          \n                                                                      \n                    If you can help, mail us at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6609131c070d0f260f08480114&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;          \n                                                                      \n                   Ouzo would like to thank all of our friends in    \n                         - HLS - FTD - ECHoS - AEROHOLiCS -          \n                                                                    \n                    -Ouzo- Getting girls drunk since 2003         \n                                                            \n                                             \n                                      \n             ascii by           \n                       cpN of cRo         \n                    2oo6!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad74fa8d80ce802ae814770f1fd76a3f42e872c3","amp;dn":"Apology.Of.An.Economic.Hitman.2008.READNFO.DVDRiP.XviD-Ouzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad74fa8d80ce802ae814770f1fd76a3f42e872c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,116,250,141,128,206,128,42,232,20,119,15,31,215,106,63,66,232,114,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
