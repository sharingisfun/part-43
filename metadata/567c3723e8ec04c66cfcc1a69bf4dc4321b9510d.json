The movie brings together, for the first time, all round Hollywood comedy director Judd Apatow and filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s star Adam Sandler. Besides Sandler, the other actors who form a part of the star studded cast are Seth Rogen, Eric Bana, Jonah Hill, Leslie Mann and a host of other actors.\n\nThe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunny PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ soundtrack boasts of a whooping 32 songs. However, only 10 are featured on the album. The soundtrack of the movie is the other thing that is in question beside the cast and the plot. The presence of an unreleased version of the Wilco soundtrack ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJesus, Etc.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the focal point of the album of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunny People.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The album has a host of other such compilations that had not seen the light of the day previously, including the James Taylor track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCarolina on My MindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which without any doubt is among one of the more lauded tracks on the list.\n\nThe genre of pop is also a part of the OST list of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunny PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in a big way. Jason Schwartzman and his band, the Coconut Records, shines successfully when they belt out some soulful, pensive lines in their songs. The Beatles are also entwined in the music for the film. Not as the Beatles jointly, but we have each of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“beatleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, from John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo, whose songs will be featured and RingoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPhotographÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is certainly among one of the more enjoyable songs of the album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567c3723e8ec04c66cfcc1a69bf4dc4321b9510d","amp;dn":"V%2FA+-+Funny+People+-+OST+-+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567c3723e8ec04c66cfcc1a69bf4dc4321b9510d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,124,55,35,232,236,4,198,108,252,193,166,155,244,220,67,33,185,81,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
