Murders is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first\n\n published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on January 6, 1936[1] and in the US by\n\n Dodd, Mead and Company on February 14 of the same year[2]. The UK edition retailed \n\n at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6)[3] and the US edition at $2.00[2].\n\n The book features the characters of Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief \n\n Inspector Japp. The form of the novel is unusual, combining first and third-person \n\n narrative. Christie had previously experimented with this approach (famously\n\n pioneered by Charles Dickens in Bleak House), in her novel The Man in the Brown \n\n Suit. What is unusual in The A.B.C. Murders is that the third-person narrative is \n\n supposedly reconstructed by the first-person narrator, Hastings. This approach\n\n shows \n\n Christie's commitment to experimenting with point of view, famously exemplified by \n\n The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.\n\n\n\n                                 \n\n\n                                      Plot\n\n\nA serial killer is murdering apparently random people in order of their names: \n\nfirst Alice Ascher of Andover, second Betty Barnard of Bexhill-on-Sea, third Sir \n\nCarmichael Clarke of Churston. The killer sends a letter to Hercule Poirot before \n\neach murder, telling him where and when each murder will take place, but Poirot and \n\nthe police always arrive too late. The killer signs himself 'ABC' and at the place \n\nof each murder, leaves an ABC Railway Guide next to the body.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91bab60b772a747a317e6b72ef389bb94b1cc0e8","amp;dn":"Agatha+Christie+%28Queen+Of+Crime%29-+The+ABC+Murders%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91bab60b772a747a317e6b72ef389bb94b1cc0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,186,182,11,119,42,116,122,49,126,107,114,239,56,155,185,75,28,192,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
