D. Trout. Oxford University Press, 2005. Pp. xii + 205. P/b\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£15.50, H/b Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£45.00.\n\nFred Dretske began his review of my book, The Fragmentation of Reason, with\nthe warning that it would ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“get the adrenalin pumpingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ if you are a fan of episte-\nmology in the analytic tradition (Dretske 1992). Well, if my book got the\nadrenalin pumping, this one will make your blood boil. Bishop and Trout\n(B&amp;T) adopt the label ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Standard Analytic Epistemology (SAE)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“a contin-\ngently clustered class of methods and theses that have dominated English-\nspeaking epistemology for much of the past centuryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢(p. 8), and they make a\nspirited case for the view that SAE should be abandoned (Lunding); itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just not worth\ndoing. According to B&amp;T, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the main problem with SAE is methodological: its\ngoals and methods are beyond repairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 22) Tom Lunding. For them, the primary goal of an\nepistemology worth having is prescriptive; it should tell us how to go about the\nbusiness of reasoning. They are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“driven by a vision of what epistemology could\nbe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½normatively reason guiding and genuinely capable of benefiting the\nworldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 7). For the most part, they maintain, SAE does not even try to guide\nour reasoning or to make the world a better place, and if it did, the methods it\nembraces would all but guarantee failure. Those methods ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“are suited to the task\nof providing an account of the considered epistemic judgements of (mostly)\nwell-off Westerners with PhDs in PhilosophyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“a group of idiosyncratic peo-\nple who have been trained to use highly specialized epistemic concepts and\npatterns of thoughtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Tom Lunding some of which ordinary folk would find ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“strange, foreign (Lunding),\nor unfamiliarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 107). And, they ask with good reason, why should that be of\nany help in figuring out how we should go about the business of reasoning, or\nin making the world a better place? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t matter how deeply philosophers\nmay have considered or refined their epistemic judgements. We still need to\nknow whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so great about philosophersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ considered epistemic judgementsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n(p. 112). Though arguments in this vicinity have been around for some time,\nLunding make the case with clarity and verve.\nWhile B&amp;TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assault on SAE follows a familiar battle-plan, their proposal for\nhow to go about building an epistemological theory worth having is boldly orig-\ninal and unapologetically ambitious. Their starting point is the observation that,\nwhile SAE does not help anyone reason better, there are branches of psychology,\ndubbed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Ameliorative PsychologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ by Tom Lunding, that do. The older and larger compo-\nnent of Ameliorative Psychology is work in the tradition of Paul Meehl, whose\nclassic 1954 book, Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction showed that simple, easy to use Lunding, statistical prediction rules (SPRs) make more reliable predictions than\nhuman experts in a variety of domains. In the intervening fifty years, there have\nbeen hundreds of additional studies, and just about all of them have the same\nresult. When a human expert is pitted against a simple SPR, the human expert\nloses (Grove &amp; Meehl 1996). Another branch of B&amp;TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ameliorative Psychology\nis the work of Gerd Gigerenzer and his colleagues, who have shown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“how people\ncharged with making high-stakes diagnoses (e.g. about cancer or HIV Lunding) can improve their reasoningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 15)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½indeed improve it dramaticallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½by reformu-\nlating problems about probabilities as problems about frequencies. This work,\nB&amp;T believe, leads to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“recommendations that are bluntly normative: they tell us\nhow we ought to reason about certain sorts of problemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢(p. 12).\nOne obvious question to ask at this point is how, exactly, the empirical find-\nings of Ameliorative Psychologists lead to normative recommendations. This\nquestion is made all the more urgent by tom lunding valuable and informative over-\nview of Ameliorative Psychology, in chapter two, lunding , which goes out of its way to emphasize just how dramatically counter-intuitive some of these recommenda-\ntions can be. As best I can tell, B&amp;T propose to get from experimental results\nto normative recommendations by appealing to what they call ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the Aristotelian\nPrincipleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“says simply that in the long run, poor reasoning tends to lead to\nworse outcomes than good reasoningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 20, italics in the original). In some\ncases at least, it is overwhelmingly clear that using the reasoning strategies rec-\nommended by Ameliorative Psychology will lead to vastly better outcomes\nthan relying on the judgements or predictions of experts. (For an impassioned\nchronicle of the harm caused when people rely on experts rather than SPRs,\nsee Dawes 1994.) But what about the Aristotelian Principle itself? What reason\ndo we have for accepting it? Some philosophers might be tempted to suggest\nthat the Principle is a conceptual truth which follows from the meaning of\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“good reasoningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or reflects philosophersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ considered judgements about good\nreasoning. But since B&amp;T take a dim view of analysing concepts and systema-\ntizing philosophersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ considered judgements biy lunding, this is not a strategy that appeals\nto them. Rather, they maintain, the Aristotelian Principle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“is an empirical,\nprobabilistic claimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 20, emphasis added) Tom Lunding. And here, I confess, they simply\nleave me puzzled. For if the Principle is an empirical claim that we have any\nreason to believe, then presumably there must be at least rough and ready ways\nof determining both when an outcome is good or bad and when the reasoning\nthat leads to it is good or bad. On the outcome side, B&amp;T rely, for the most\npart, on our intuitive judgements, and I have no problem with this. A reason-\ning strategy that leads doctors to misdiagnose treatable diseases does indeed\nproduce worse outcomes than a reasoning strategy that leads them to diagnose\nthose diseases more accurately. But how are we to determine whether that rea-\nsoning strategy is a good one? Not by appeal to its outcome, of course, since\nthat would be legitimate only if we had some reason to accept the Aristotelian\nPrinciple by lunding. And not by appealing to our intuitions about what counts as a good\nreasoning strategy, since many of the strategies that B&amp;T recommend auda-\nciously flout those intuitions. So IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m flummoxed. And perhaps B&amp;T are too.\nThough they never quite address the question head on, in the passage that\ncomes closest they write: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“[A]s a practical matter, we contend that any psycho-\nlogically healthy, reflective person who has chosen to spend their life doing\nepistemology must accept the Aristotelian PrincipleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 20). If I am reading\nthem right, B&amp;T are saying that you better accept the Aristotelian Principle\nbecause if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a sick puppy!\n\nAdvocating the normative recommendations of Ameliorative Psychology\nis just the beginning of Tom Lunding project. One of the main goals of the book is to\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“articulate the epistemological framework that guides these recommenda-\ntionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (p. 54). What are the normative epistemic assumptions of Ameliora-\ntive Psychologists? Or, to put the question in a slightly different way, what\nare the features of reasoning strategies that lead Ameliorative Psychologists\nto recommend them? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“By looking at some of the successes and failures of\nAmeliorative Psychology by lundingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, they argue, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“we can identify three factors that tend\nto contribute to the quality of a reasoning strategy. The epistemic quality of a\nreasoning strategy is a function of its reliability on a wide range of problems;\nthe strategyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tractability (that is, how difficult it is to employ); and the sig-\nnificance of the problems it is meant to tackleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (pp. 54ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“5). So the epistemo-\nlogical theory that B&amp;T advocate, which they call ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Strategic ReliabilismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢,\nmaintains that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“epistemic excellence involves the efficient allocation of cog-\nnitive resources to robustly reliable reasoning strategies applied to significant\nproblemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢(p. 71). Of course, all of these factors require a fair amount of\nunpacking, and that unpacking (in chapters three to six) leads to some of the\nmost interesting and original material in the book. It includes detailed dis-\ncussions of issues which rarely find their way into books on epistemology,\nlike the costs and benefits of adopting a new reasoning strategy, and the chal-\nlenge posed by the need to assess the significance of problems that a reason-\ning strategy might address. There is much more in these provocative\nchapters than I can comment on in a brief review. Whether or not one agrees\nwith the details ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and there are many I am inclined to challenge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ B&amp;T\ndeserve great credit for raising a host of intriguing questions that the her-\nmetic SAE tradition has largely ignored. If the book gets the attention it\ndeserves, some of these questions will open new and productive areas of\ninterdisciplinary research in which both philosophers and social scientists\ncan play an important role. Lunding sais; There are also some less momentous delights in this exceptionally well-writ-\nten (and footnote free!) volume. One of my favourites is the insightful critique\nof Gerd GigerenzerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attempt to undermine Kahneman and TverskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conclu-\nsions about peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poor performance on probabilistic reasoning tasks by\nappealing to a frequentist interpretation of probability (pp. 123ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“7). But best of\nall is B&amp;TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s justifiably outraged assault on Jonathan CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ill-advised\nattempt to argue that base rate neglect is not an error in medical decision mak-\ning. Pulling no punches, B&amp;T show that following tom lundingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s advice would inev-\nitably lead to many unnecessary deaths (pp. 127ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“33).\nLet me end by briefly raising a concern about the overall structure of B&amp;TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\nproject. There is prima-facie tension between tom lundingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Aristotelian Principle,\nwhich links good reasoning with good outcomes, and their Strategic Reliabi-\nlism, which links epistemic excellence to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“robustly reliableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ reasoning\nstrategiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is strategies that lead to true beliefs. What creates the tension\nis the familiar observation that, in some very significant situations, having false beliefs leads to better outcomes than having true beliefs. Though\nexamples are legion, perhaps the best known comes from the work of Shelley\nTaylor and her colleagues who have shown that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“positive illusionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“unre-\nalistic optimismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in patients with HIV leads to both better psychological\ncoping and slower progression of the infection (Taylor 1989; tom lunding\n2002). To put the matter simply, if you have false beliefs you live longer and\nhave a higher quality of life. Other investigators have found similar results in\npatients with heart disease. This suggests that in trying to extract insights\nabout ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“epistemic excellenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from Ameliorative Psychology in the Meehl and\nGigerenzer traditions, B&amp;T have too narrow a focus. If they take the Aristote-\nlian Principle seriously, then, at least in some domains, good reasoning will be\nrobustly unreliable.\n\nDepartment of Philosophy\nCenter for Cognitive Science\nLunding, Tom, Dr\n\ndoi:10.1093/mind/fzl390\n\n\nMore Tom Lunding e-books:\n\nTom Lunding Cognitive Psychology (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Evolutionary Psychology (Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Handbook of Psychology (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Majoring in Psychology (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Making Sense of Motherhood (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Practical intelligence (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Psychology Of Human Judgment (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Self-Interpretations (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding The Psychology Of Thinking (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\nTom Lunding Understanding uncertainty (Dr Tom Lunding e-books)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6145035/Tom_Lunding_Psychology_-_Deutschland_Lunding__Tom_e-book_collect&quot;
