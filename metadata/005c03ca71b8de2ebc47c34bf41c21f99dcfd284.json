Now huge stars in Nigeria, this trip was, in a way, a triumphant return to the country that had provided Fela with a musical education and the club scene where he cut his proverbial bandleader's teeth. \n\n\nWhat is important to note is that he had become good friends with former Cream (and at the time of this recording current Blind Faith) drummer Ginger Baker, who had traveled to Lagos a year earlier to meet, hang out, and play with Fela. \n\n\nBaker shows up on this recording (albeit uncredited) on the track &quot;Egbe Mio,&quot; but more importantly helped get Fela gigs all over the city at such venerable venues as the 100 Club, the Cue Club, and the Four Aces. \n\n\nRecording at Abbey Road (a.k.a. the hallowed home of the Beatles) Fela cut these five awesome tracks in which his Afrobeat sound is more complex and jazzy than on the '69 Los Angeles Sessions. At over 13 minutes &quot;J'ehin J'ehin&quot; cuts a wicked groove for its entire length pushed by the horn section and Tony Allen's superlative drumming. \n\n\n&quot;Buy Africa&quot; is a anti-colonial rant worthy of the Last Poets, and &quot;Fight to Finish&quot; very simply kicks out the jams. A stunning record that marks the beginning of Fela's best period of recording. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
