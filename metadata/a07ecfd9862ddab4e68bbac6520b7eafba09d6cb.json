That is exactly the message this CD sends.\nThis is worship music as it should be, from the heart and from the mind. It contains beautiful melodies, soft harmonies, and intelligent heart-felt lyrics that intertwine with the Word of God. The Lord loves when we pray His Word back to Him, and this CD is filled to the brim with scripture. Shane Barnard and Shane Everett really help you to consider your relationship with God through their guitar-driven acoustic folk/pop/rock music, prayers and words. It cries worship!\n\nScripture is found throughout the lyrics of this CD and Barnard does a wonderful job of combining his own perceptions of God's greatness into the Word for the songs. &quot;Your mercy reigns, Your mercy comes, Your mercy falls and rises with the sun.....It's new every morning, it's good enough for me&quot; from &quot;Mercy Reigns&quot; exalts God's mercy through uplifting melodies and breathy, prayerful vocals from man to God.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07ecfd9862ddab4e68bbac6520b7eafba09d6cb","amp;dn":"Shane+And+Shane+-+2003+-+Carry+Away","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07ecfd9862ddab4e68bbac6520b7eafba09d6cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,126,207,217,134,45,218,180,230,139,186,198,82,11,126,175,186,9,214,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
