Building upon its patented predecessor and namesake, TruSurround XT not only solves the problem of playing 5.1 or 6.1 multichannel content over two speakers or headphones, but also utilizes proprietary algorithms from SRS Labs - Dialog Clarity and TruBass - to provide listeners with a truly immersive audio experience.\n\nTruSurround XT accepts input from up to a 7 channel (6.1) audio source and processing a 2 channel output. When receiving multichannel content, TruSurround XT virtualizes the channels, creating &quot;phantom&quot; speakers that appear to extend all around the listener, producing an amazing surround sound effect. When receiving mono or stereo content, TruSurround XT includes the functionality of SRS WOW to present an expansive three dimensional sound field.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChangelog build 2701 (2011-03-07):\n\nIssues resolved:\n\n- CyberLink PowerDVD cannot play back the MACROSS F MOVIE Blu-ray Disc title.\n- CyberLink PowerDVD cannot play back disc two of the Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray Disc title.\n- CyberLink PowerDVD cannot enable hardware acceleration during the playback of videos with .WTS file extension.\n- CyberLink PowerDVD cannot navigate DVD content that has been ripped.\n- CyberLink PowerDVD cannot jump to different moments of a video by clicking along the navigational slider, when playing a file with the .M2TS file extension.\n- Users cannot activate the Ultra version of CyberLink PowerDVD if the standard version was previously installed.\n- Revision made to the drive authentication fails warning message encountered during playback.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstall: Just run Setup.exe and you are done, it's registered and activated.\n\nNote: This Setup does not install the PowerDVD Toolbar (the Mini Player Mode)\nIf you want to use it then extract the Tweak Pack and run Enable_Toolbar.bat\n\n\n========================================\n:: Black Skin for PowerDVD 10 Mark II ::\n========================================\n\nChanges between the default and the modified skin:\n\n- Replaced the background and removed the Feature Icons (logos)\n- Changed the auto-hide delay from the tabs to 1 sec (default = 3)\n- Smaller Mini Mode: removed the Cyberlink logo &amp; the Config button\n- Removed the Upgrade button and the divider before the Help button\n- Fixed Mini Mode buttons (no more white lines)\n\nPowerDVD 10 Mark II Skinpack: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5999221\n\n\n================================\n:: Tweak Pack for PowerDVD 10 ::\n================================\n\nBlu-Ray_Region_Reset.bat:         Resets the Blu-Ray region settings\nDisable_BD_Mouse_Pop-up.bat:      Disables the Blu-Ray disk Mouse support Pop-up\nEnable/Disable_3DFeature.bat:     Enables/Disables the 3D Feature\nEnable/Disable_MoovieLive.bat:    Enables/Disables MoovieLive, Remix + Comments\nEnable/Disable_CinemaMode.bat:    Enables/Disables the Cinema Mode\nEnable/Disable_CLFLVSplitter.bat: Enables/Disables the FLV Splitter *\nReset_HD_Dailog.bat:              Resets the High-Definition Content dialog **\nRemove/Restore_StartupApps.bat:   Removes/Restores the Startup Applications ***\nEnable/Disable_Toolbar.bat:       Enables/Disables the PowerDVD Toolbar\nEnable/Disable_Upgrade.bat:       Enables/Disables the Upgrade Popups and Buttons\n\n\n*    CLFLVSplitter.ax can cause a crash when you play flv videos in Windows Media\n     Player.
