And i was not even keen to watch it, But had to watch it to kill time, And i am happy that i did. The Director (Rohit Shetty) has regain his 'Golmal'  touch to some extent in All the Best. Movie succeeds in its attempt to create laughter. the best part of the movie is that it at least does not irritate you in its attempt to create comedy. Movie drags initially and gives a deja-vu feeling due to its similar Goan background and few of characters. But it really picks after Sanju baba's entry. good to see him doing a fine job here, He was wasted in the movie  Blue or i should that the movie was a  waste. Anyway, lets get back to All The Best. The story is again  on same plot of the usual bollywood type, based on the confusions, but thats not the all part and there are some other characters too who add some spices to the curry. I would like to mention that character of RGV, the Guy from the famous TV show Office-Office (Somebody tell me his name Pls).\n\nSanjay Dutt excels in this movie, His Comic timing was superb in some sequences. Bipasha looks hot. Fardeen has done his best work so far  in No Entry and cant go beyond that performance , i guess. But he managed the momentum going. Ajay Devgan is good. Mugdha lacks the timing and Director could have shown a bit more of her Oomph part which she has in plenty. She was almost ignored and no pity for that.Good to see Johny Lever after a long time in a decent role, though we already had enough of him, But this time he did not repelled for a change and was pretty tolerable.(He opens his mouth to speak only at the end of the movie)\n\nMusic was not worth remembering and i dont even recallr a single song or any piece of melody from it even though i ve seen it only  2 hours before. \n\nOver all I would give it 3 and a half star out of five. A good time pass, and feel good comedy.\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/24407336.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/24407336.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/52341707.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/52341707.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/75791298.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/75791298.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/82511033.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/82511033.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/90358496.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/90358496.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/93024531.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imageuploadsite.com/images/93024531.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nUploded By- Sach007\n\nWrite Your Comments:).\n\nEnjoy.....!!!\n\nMail Me- &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;3d6e5c5e55545313775c59580f057d7a505c5451135e525013&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4daa172ceef2c279f2fd56e339d98539bcf4c692","amp;dn":"All+the+Best+-+DVDRip+-+XviD+-+1CDRip+-+%5BDDR%5D%5BSach004%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4daa172ceef2c279f2fd56e339d98539bcf4c692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,170,23,44,238,242,194,121,242,253,86,227,57,217,133,57,188,244,198,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
