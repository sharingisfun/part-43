Lewis and Hathaway enter the\n                archaic world of St Gerard's Hall when a visiting\n                female bishop is found dead after drinking poisoned\n                wine. Was she was murdered because her liberal views\n                contradicted those of the reactionary religious\n                leaders of the college - or is something more\n                sinister afoot? When another two deaths occur, both\n                mirroring macabre murders from Jacobean revenge\n                tragedy, Lewis and Hathaway realise that the motive\n                is much more twisted. Someone is seeking a bizarre\n                form of wild justice for crimes committed against\n                them over 20 years before.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29601645d4277f24bff5942a054f530d7640bc62","amp;dn":"Lewis.S05E02.HDTV.XviD-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29601645d4277f24bff5942a054f530d7640bc62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,96,22,69,212,39,127,36,191,245,148,42,5,79,83,13,118,64,188,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
