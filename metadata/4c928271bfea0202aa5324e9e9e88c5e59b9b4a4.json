The trend turns into a movement. A German Summer of Love, which changes whole lives overnight and kick-starts careers.\nThe basic principle of Techno stands for experimenting, crossing borders and DIY. Fans become DJs or party promoters. Labels are founded and record stores open up. The scene grows. An independent microcosm is created. Networks are formed away from established structures. For a moment everything seems possibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nWE CALL IT TECHNO! tells the story of a tempestuous phase in music history, the first time that pop culture was created significantly in Germany.\nWith exclusive interviews and comprehensive, mostly unreleased film and photo archive material from the years 1988-1993!\n\nIncl. Statements from Ata, Cosmic Baby, Mijk van Dijk, Elsa for Toys, Hell, Mike Ink., JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rgen Laarmann, Mark Reeder, Tanith, Triple R, Upstart, Sven VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤th, Wolle XDP and many more.\n\ncheck trailer on utube","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c928271bfea0202aa5324e9e9e88c5e59b9b4a4","amp;dn":"We+call+it+techno+DVDRiP+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c928271bfea0202aa5324e9e9e88c5e59b9b4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,146,130,113,191,234,2,2,170,83,36,233,233,232,140,94,89,185,180,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
