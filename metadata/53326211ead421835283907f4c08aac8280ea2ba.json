David Sylvian is a man apart. In a thirty-year career that spans the New Romantic movement, ambient works and Progressive Rock, and mature and esoteric Pop, Sylvian has tested popular styles and bent them to his own vision. On Manafon, Sylvian pursues &quot;a completely modern kind of chamber music. Intimate, dynamic, emotive, democratic, economical.&quot; In sessions in London, Vienna, and Tokyo, Sylvian assembled the world's leading improvisers and innovators, artists who explore free improvisation, space-specific performance, and live electronics. From Evan Parker and Keith Rowe, to Fennesz and members of Polwechsel, to Sachiko M and Otomo Yoshihide, the musicians provide both a backdrop and a counterweight to his own vocal performances.\n\n____________________________________________________________\n \n\nPer commenti e recensioni in italiano visitate anche http://trfkad.baywords.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53326211ead421835283907f4c08aac8280ea2ba","amp;dn":"David+Sylvian+-+Manafon+%5Bmp3-vbr-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53326211ead421835283907f4c08aac8280ea2ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,50,98,17,234,212,33,131,82,131,144,127,76,8,170,200,40,14,162,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
