Some see it as a paean to peace, others call it a violent mandate for worldwide Islamic supremacy.\nHow can one book lead to such dramatically different conclusions? New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer reveals the truth in The Complete Infidel's Guide to the Koran: not many Westerners know what's in the Koran, since so few have actually read it -- even among the legions of politicians, diplomats, analysts, and editorial writers who vehemently insist that the Koran preaches tolerance.\n\nNow, Spencer unveils the mysteries lying behind this powerful book, guiding readers through the controversies surrounding the Koran's origins and its most contentious passages. Stripping out the obsolete debates, Spencer focuses on the Koran's decrees toward Jews, Christians, and other Infidels, explaining how they were viewed in Muhammad's time, what they've supposedly done wrong, and most important, what the Koran has in store for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e51f7be460cb3e950fe120b7c3677a42a2d8f36","amp;dn":"Infidel%5C%27s+Guide+to+the+Koran-Robert+Spencer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e51f7be460cb3e950fe120b7c3677a42a2d8f36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,81,247,190,70,12,179,233,80,254,18,11,124,54,119,164,42,45,143,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
