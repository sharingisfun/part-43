Their remix catalogue, in fact, outweighs their studio releases by a significant margin, and knowing where to begin sifting through the towering stack of extended singles can prove tricky. Fortunately, REMIXES 81-04 offers a Reader's Digest version of the band's remixes, boiling down the best from Mute's three-disc set of the same name, and providing casual fans with a manageable starting point. REMIXES 81-04 acts, on one hand, as a sampler of the band's remix history, but also includes new mixes by contemporary studio wizards.\n\nWhile not comprehensive, REMIXES 81-04 is outstanding nonetheless, highlighting the group's club-friendly, industrial-tinged dance beats while leaving room for their brooding melodic pop. The oldest mix, Daniel Miller's &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; (1981), with its Kraftwerk-inspired electro-boogie, bears its age but is still compelling. Highlights include Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister's acid-lounge treatment of &quot;Useless,&quot; Air's lush re-invention of &quot;Home,&quot; and Dave Bascombe's work on &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; which deepens the song's throbbing, hard-driving groove. In all, the album offers a fine cross-section of Depeche Mode's remarkable talent for invention and reinvention.\n\n\n\nCD 1\n01. Never Let Me Down Again [Split Mix] Depeche Mode &amp; D.
