Spy Protector + Key\n \n\n\nSecurity Task Manager shows comprehensible information about programs &amp; processes \nrunning on the computer (applications, DLLs, BHOs, and services).  \n\nFor each process, it improves on Windows Task Manager, it's providing a security \nrisk rating, a process description, file path, CPU usage graph, start time, \nembedded hidden functions (for example keyboard monitoring, autostart entry, and \nbrowser supervision or manipulation), and process type, such as visible window, \nsystray program, DLL, and IE plug-in. \n\nThe security risk rating indicates the likelihood of the process being potential \nspyware, malware, a Trojan, or keylogger.\n\nThe Security Task Manager detects unknown malware and rootkits hidden from your \nantivirus software.\n\nIt also deletes traces of your Internet and computer activity, prevents keyboard \ninput monitoring, and warns you when the registry is changed. This process viewer \nalso recognizes stealth processes and virtual driver software hidden from the \nWindows Task Manager.\n\n\n\nSome features of Security Task Manager:\n\n- Unique security risk rating \n- The security risk rating indicates the likelihood of a process being potential \n  spyware, malware or a Trojan. The rating is purely based on behaviour and code \n  analysis, and does not use any signature files. \n- Full directory path and file name \n- Process description \n- CPU usage graph \n- Embedded hidden functions (e.g. keyboard monitoring, browser supervision or \n  manipulation) \n- Process type (e.g. visible window, systray program, DLL, IE-plugin, startup \n  service) \n \n\n\n* The full version of Security Task Manager also contains SpyProtector for \n  protecting your computer and Internet privacy:\n\n- Prevents keyboard and mouse monitoring \nThat stops keylogger or other hacker tools\n\n- Warns when registry is changed \nThat protects you from Trojans that surreptitiously add an autostart key\n\n- Eliminates the traces of your internet activity \ne.g. cookies, cache, history, typed URLs and temporary files\n\n- Eliminates the traces of your work on computer \ne.g. recent used file list of programs (Word, ACDSee, PDF, WinZip, Media player)\n\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n- Windows Vista, XP, 2000, 2003, NT, ME, 95, 98 \n- On Windows Vista, program's help file needs Microsoft WinHlp32 \n- 2 MB free disk space \n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at sept, 05 2009 - 21.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb18dcb8159391a8d108273ad938b4831e799460","amp;dn":"Security+Task+Manager+1.6f+incl.+Spy+Protector+%28Full%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb18dcb8159391a8d108273ad938b4831e799460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,24,220,184,21,147,145,168,209,8,39,58,217,56,180,131,30,121,148,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
