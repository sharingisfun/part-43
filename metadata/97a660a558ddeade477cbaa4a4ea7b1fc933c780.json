When she actually meets him in her own apartment building, she finds out Jack is engaged to the quintessential gorgeous bitch, Quinn. The conflict ensues and the romance is tested. Whether it's indulging her loony Grandma through rehearsals of her own funeral, or dealing with the overzealous video-store manager and his crush, June stumbles through her potential love life, her best friend Mary at her side.\n\nCast:\nFelicia Day...........June Marie Jacobs\nChris Henry Coffey....Jack Simenson\nCindy Dolenc..........Quinn Kennedy Rifkin\nEllen Geer............Grandma P.\n\nimdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407908/\n\nripped with RipBot264 by R@100\n\nAudio lnaguage: English\n\nVIDEO: [avc1] 720x480 24bpp 29.970 fps\nAUDIO: 48000 Hz, 2 ch, s161e\n\nfiles:\nJune.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Alternate Ending.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Alternate Opening 2.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Alternate Opening.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Bob the Chicken 2.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Bob the Chicken.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Dad Calls June.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Extra Party Footage.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Grandma Dies.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Jack and June Almost Kiss.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Jack and June Talk.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - June at Mary's Apartment.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - June Calls Mrs. Nedman.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - June Talks with Dad.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - June, Jack and the Stairs.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - June's Sister Talk.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Mary, June and Mr. Jenkins.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Mika and Steve at Store.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Mr. Junkins, The Stalker.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Quinn's Party for Jack.mkv\nJune - Extras - Deleted - Steve and June.mkv\nJune - Extras - Featurette.mkv\nJune - Extras - Outtakes.mkv\nJune - Extras - Trailer.mkv","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a660a558ddeade477cbaa4a4ea7b1fc933c780","amp;dn":"June+2004+DVDRip+%2B+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a660a558ddeade477cbaa4a4ea7b1fc933c780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,166,96,165,88,221,234,222,71,124,186,164,164,234,123,31,201,51,199,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
