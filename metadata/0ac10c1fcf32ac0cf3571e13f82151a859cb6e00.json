Written over 800 years ago, the Mayan prophecies predicted the First World War, the rise of Hitler, and the December 2006 tsunami that devastated South East Asia. In just a few short years, on December 21, 2012, the Mayans predict that a natural disaster of untold proportions will destroy the earth and wipe out all mankind. As December 21, 2012 approaches, the Mayan prophecies are gaining world-wide attention. \n\nThe Maya believed that everything including creation and destruction occurred in cycles. Their calendar spanned five cycles, each lasting approximately 5,200 years. At the end of each cycle before this one, the Maya believed the current, flawed creation had to be destroyed for the world to be born again. Some believe the end of the current cycle on December 21, 2012, is an apocalyptic sign. And those who see a connection between the complex and incredibly accurate Maya calendar and a prophecy that the world will end in 2012 point to an unexpected discovery made in 2003.\n\nThis captivating documentary looks for the truth behind the compelling myth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is there evidence of global upheaval on a massive scale? We follow scientist Adam Maloof to three continents on a detective story that spans eons, with clues embedded in the oldest rocks on the planet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Chris Saul \n========================\n\n\nProduced by: Carsten Oblaender\n==============================\n\n\n\nWritten by: Laurie K.Miller \n===========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    2012 The Final Prophecy\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:44:45\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    720x416\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2075 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    664 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac10c1fcf32ac0cf3571e13f82151a859cb6e00","amp;dn":"2012+The+Final+Prophecy-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ac10c1fcf32ac0cf3571e13f82151a859cb6e00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,193,12,31,207,50,172,12,243,87,30,19,248,33,81,168,89,203,110,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
