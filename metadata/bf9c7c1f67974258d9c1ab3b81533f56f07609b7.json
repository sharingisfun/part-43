His fate -- and the fate of the world -- is tied to four other kids across the globe. The second is a street kid in Peru. He and Matt have never met; they don't even speak the same language. But destiny is going to throw them together as the evil threat of the Old Ones grows . . . and another Gate suddenly comes into play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9c7c1f67974258d9c1ab3b81533f56f07609b7","amp;dn":"Evil+Star+%28The+Gatekeepers%29+-+Anthony+Horowitz+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf9c7c1f67974258d9c1ab3b81533f56f07609b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,156,124,31,103,151,66,88,217,193,171,59,129,83,63,86,240,118,9,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
