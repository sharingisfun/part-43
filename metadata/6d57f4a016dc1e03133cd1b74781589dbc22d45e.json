He accidentally discovers that the Chinese Mafia, the Tong, is using his newly discovered ancient Chinese artifacts to hide and smuggle narcotics across the border. Robert immediately tries to flee with his assistant and narrowly manages to escape the pursuing Tong but not without a heavy price. His loyal assistant is killed and he is framed with the evidence at the Chinese border by the Chinese military and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. He is locked up in a Chinese prison where he is guilty until proven innocent. His loving wife Maya vows to help get him out of jail. The DEA finally convinces the Chinese military that Robert may be of more help to them outside jail by leading them to the real smugglers. Once he leaves his Chinese prison cell Robert would rather enjoy his freedom back in the U.S.\n\nVideo Format:\n\nFORMAT:MPEG-4\nFILE SIZE:699 MiB\nDURATION:1h 29mn\nWIDTH: 1280 pixels\nHEIGHT:720 pixels\nASPECT RATIO:16:9\nFRAME RATE:23.976 fps\nVIDEO BITRATE:1 019 Kbps\nLANGUAGE: English \n\nAudio Format:\n\nFORMAT: AAC\nFormat/Info:: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version: Version 4\nFormat profile: LC\nCodec ID: A_AAC\nDuration:1h 29mn\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nChannel positions: Front: L R\nBit rate:64.0 Kbps\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7840/80547462.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7840/80547462.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/2751/31352826.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/2751/31352826.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/4818/94866083.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/4818/94866083.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/199/14592285.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img209.imageshack.us/img209/199/14592285.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/3782/39711662.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/3782/39711662.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::::::::::::Enjoy Another Release of Simba!::::::::::::::::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d57f4a016dc1e03133cd1b74781589dbc22d45e","amp;dn":"Out+For+A+Kill-2003-BRRip-+720p-x264-%7BSimba%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d57f4a016dc1e03133cd1b74781589dbc22d45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,87,244,160,22,220,30,3,19,60,209,183,71,129,88,157,188,34,212,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
