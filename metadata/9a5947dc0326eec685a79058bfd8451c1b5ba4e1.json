Austin's wardrobe is pure Carnaby Street at its most outrageous, his vocabulary is crowded by the cool lingo of the day (&quot;Groovy, baby! Yeah!!&quot;), and he's irresistible to women, despite the fact that he can be charitably described as &quot;stocky&quot; and has teeth that strike fear into any practicing dentist. When his nemesis, the arch-enemy Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), has himself cryogenically frozen and sent into space, Powers also has himself put on ice so he can be thawed out when Dr. Evil returns. Come 1997, Dr. Evil returns to Earth and is back to his old tricks, so Austin is thawed out and returned to active service -- though he soon discovers his style doesn't play so well 30 years on. The supporting cast includes Elizabeth Hurley as Austin's sidekick, Vanessa Kensington; Michael York as his boss, Basil Exposition; Robert Wagner as Dr. Evil's assistant, Number Two; and Seth Green as Dr. Evil's troubled son, Scott Evil. Ming Tea, the swingin' pop band that periodically backs up Austin, includes real life pop-rockers Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was a mild box-office hit but an even bigger success on home video, which led to the 1999 sequel, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.\n\n\nM P A A  R A T I N G  * * *\n\nRated PG-13 for nudity, sex-related dialogue and humor.\n\n\nR E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\n2 May 1997\n\n\nD V D  C o n t e n t  * * *\n  \nMain Movie ******:\n* Video - UNTOUCHED - 4116 Kbps Fullscreen\n* Audio - English, French\n* Subs  - English, Spanish, French\n\nMenu ************:\n* Yes\n\nExtras **********:\n* All\n\nRipped **********:\n* Nothing\n\nChapters ********:\n\n0.
