That means 64k's up between 12 - 1:30 est, and 128k's \nup around 7ish. Sorry for any issues that causes but it is \nwhat it is. Should be the last of it for awhile, next &quot;heads up&quot; \ncould be retirement depending on how things play out. I love \ngetting O&amp;A out to the fans but I won't be able to do it forever. \nSomeone else will step up for the community when the time comes.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40c463dfe352cf5e119271fbe0063aa51e6257a","amp;dn":"Opie+and+Anthony+2009-07-30-O%26A+CF128k+VBR+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40c463dfe352cf5e119271fbe0063aa51e6257a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,12,70,61,254,53,44,245,225,25,39,31,190,0,99,170,81,230,37,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
