He explores the upgrades to the interface and covers soft selection and other modeling tools. George then delves into more complex new features, including the Asset Manager for organizing objects and nodes within a scene; animation layering to blend, merge, group, reorder, override, and add to preceding layers; Maya Muscle, for creating lifelike skin motion; and nParticles, a new particle system. Exercise files accompany the course.\n\nReleased on: 12/11/2008\n\nTable of contents\n\nIntroduction\n\tWelcome \t1:14 \t18.2 MB\n\tUsing the exercise files \t1:27 \t1.5 MB\n1.
