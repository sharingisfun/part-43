No pro at this but tried and tested to work perfectly. I didn't think it would be that enjoyable on a smaller screen but it is! Hope you enjoy and continue seeding.\n\nNo pro at any of this, just re-encoded using a program but its tried and tested to work correctly (i even prefer the quality to the original source) so i hope you enjoy!\n\nI did notice some small problems ocassionally if you play it on your ipod/itouch/etc but pressing the enlarge/shrink button (top right corner) fixed any and all problems\n\nI HAVE NOT tested it on the psp/zune but it looks like it should be compatible\n\nand remember, SEED! SEED! SEED!, you don't like spending hours to download a movie and neither do others.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8608cd19319eab05314b080e8545ab98ff8e4740","amp;dn":"Transformers+Revenge+of+the+Fallen+%28Ipod%29.M4V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8608cd19319eab05314b080e8545ab98ff8e4740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,8,205,25,49,158,171,5,49,75,8,14,133,69,171,152,255,142,71,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
