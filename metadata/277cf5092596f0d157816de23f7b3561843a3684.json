It moves diagonally between the post-folk intellectualism of Mighty Flashlight and David Grubbs and through the achy hope of Peggy Honeywell, touching on the traditionalism of Be Good Tanyas and Calexico along the way. In between there's Low's &quot;In Metal&quot; -- a standout from that group's 2001 effort Things We Lost in the Fire -- as well as literate roots material from Chicagoans Wilco, Jim O'Rourke, and Sam Prekop. Scud Mountain Boys' &quot;Silo&quot; could be the most affecting thing here. &quot;I'm gonna shoot the livestock when I go,&quot; Joe Pernice hums over a mournful acoustic guitar. The line aptly describes the acrid smoke of finality, human frailty, and love-fueled rage that's always permeated country and roots music; it's the same cloud of dust that hangs over the powerful, introspective Another Country.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n1.
