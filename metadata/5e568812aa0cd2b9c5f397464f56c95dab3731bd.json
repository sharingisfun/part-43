This led to them signing with cult US label Nuclear War Now! and re-issuing the demo on 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vinyl with a bonus track (a cover of ancient Australian band Necrotomy).\n\n2008 saw the release of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEroded void of salvationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, followed up by gigs throughout Australia. Later on during the year a split 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with fellow Australians Tzun Tzu was issued as well. In 2009, the band released their first full length album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Death TransmutationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, through Nuclear War Now! Productions.\n\nIgnivomous exists to procreate dark Death Metal, nothing more, nothing less.\n \nBorn out of the various members desire to see a resurgence of a dissonant, heavy style of Death Metal devoid of influences from grind, slam, gore, etc, but leaning towards the claustrophobic style of such albums as &quot;Onward to Golgotha&quot;, &quot;Dawn of Possesion&quot;, &quot;Ritual of Infinity&quot;, etc: a time when Death Metal had not sunk into self-parody, gore-obsessed retardation and cretinous gimmicks. A time when Death Metal meant DEATH. \n\nWhile the members of Ignivomous have for all played in other bands and projects ranging as far afield as Doom, Industrial/Neo-classical, Black-thrash and Grind, there has been a concious decicion to maintain a purity of focus and avoid genre cross-pollination.\n\n\nCurrent line-up \nJael Edwards - Bass/Vocals (Accursed (Aus), Exercitus)\nChris Broadway aka Chris Volcano - Drums/Vocals (Abominator, DestrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶yer 666, Destruktor, Denouncement Pyre, Urgrund)\nSean Hinds - Guitar (Earth (Aus), Cryptal Darkness, Exercitus, Urgrund, Zero)\n\nGenre = Death Metal\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
