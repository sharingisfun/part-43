Lynne Hanson calls her music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œporch music with a little Texas red dirt.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sound thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been receiving applause from enamoured critics and devoted fans in Canada, the US, Europe and Australia, garnering Hanson the 2010 Colleen Peterson Songwriting Award, a 2009 Canadian Folk Music Award nomination, and a place as a finalist in the prestigious 2009 Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk competition.\n\nDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t go labelling her a country crooner, but Hanson sure knows how to share her troubles in a song with tales of heartbreak without a hint of sentimentality. Hanson sings simply and honestly about loss and the search for redemption.\n\nThat redemption comes out at her live shows. No one leaves a Lynne Hanson concert feeling heavy-hearted. Onstage Hanson is a happy-go-lucky storyteller with a gift of gab and a wink in her eye, engaging her audience just as much with her stories and one-liners as she can with her music. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intimate with her audience as if sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s shooting the breeze with old friends at her kitchen table.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/02/lynne-hanson/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74e922755879123355ee68a56d942c3444e5ce2","amp;dn":"Lynne+Hanson...Once+the+Sun+Goes+Down%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74e922755879123355ee68a56d942c3444e5ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,78,146,39,85,135,145,35,53,94,230,138,86,217,66,195,68,78,92,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
