My ISP is going to terminate my service if I max out my monthly limit, so I just can't continue to seed all by myself so often. PLEASE help to seed. Thank you.  :)\n\n\n\nFrom IMDB:\n&quot;Herman discovers he's the new lord of Munster Hall in England. The family sails to Britain, where they receive a tepid welcome from Lady Effigy and Freddie Munster, who throws tantrums because he wasn't named Lord Munster. An on-board romance had blossomed between Marilyn and Roger, but on land Marilyn discovers Roger's family holds a longstanding grudge against the Munsters. Herman upholds the family honor in an auto race; he and Grandpa also unlock &quot;the secret of Munster Hall.&quot;\n\nI made this smaller version from an ISO rip someone else made, so thank you to that person (I don't remember where I got it). I've also included the Spanish and French subtitles.\n\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05ba9613ebc673529352b7cb583a30aa0abfede","amp;dn":"Munsters%2C+Go+Home%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05ba9613ebc673529352b7cb583a30aa0abfede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,91,169,97,62,188,103,53,41,53,43,124,181,131,163,10,160,171,254,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
