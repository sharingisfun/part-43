Hot, steamy fusion from '74 will make you sweat today, so be sure to have a cold drink on hand while listening!\n\n\nWeather Report's fourth recording finds Wayne Shorter (on soprano and tenor) taking \na lesser role as Joe Zawinul begins to really dominate the group's sound. Most selections also include bassist Alphonso Johnson and drummer Ishmael Wilburn although the personnel shifts from track to track. &quot;Nubian Sundance&quot; adds several vocalists while &quot;Blackthorn Rose&quot; is a Shorter-Zawinul duet. Overall the music is pretty stimulating and sometimes adventurous; high-quality fusion from 1974. \n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
