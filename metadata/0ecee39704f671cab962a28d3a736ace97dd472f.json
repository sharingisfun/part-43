Contending with his partner's new fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and the dimwitted head of   \n Scotland Yard, the dauntless detective must unravel the clues that will      \n lead him into a twisted web of murder, deceit, and black magic - and the     \n deadly embrace of temptress Irene Adler.                                     \n                                                                              \n\n--------==========----------\nHappy Hacker Industries \n\nJust a group of friends who believe in quality Audio/Video rips.\nThese rips are made from retail DVD and audio CDs.
