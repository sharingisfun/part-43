Not a demented fan, not a jilted lover. Someone interested in finding out how Richard came up with his runaway bestselling novel. Because, unbeknownst to Richard, his fantasy novel was non-fiction.\n\nHow could Richard have written about an event no one should have known about, after it had been meticulously eradicated from human history? Who are the Blackburne Covenant? And how could the secrets they've been concealing for hundreds of years completely change life on Earth? They're willing to kill Richard Kaine in order to keep him quiet.\n\nWritten by Fabian Nicieza (X-Force, Thunderbolts, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and illustrated by Stefano Raffaele (Conan the Barbarian).\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b41d0a08a66f12c90f03086fe4317817e89c8c","amp;dn":"The+Blackburne+Covenant+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b41d0a08a66f12c90f03086fe4317817e89c8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,180,29,10,8,166,111,18,201,15,3,8,111,228,49,120,23,232,156,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
