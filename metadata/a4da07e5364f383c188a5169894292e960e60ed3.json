It is the fourth single from his 2009 studio album American Saturday Night. The song first charted in 2009 as an album cut before its release to radio.\n\nIn &quot;Water,&quot; the narrator lists off various situations involving water: playing in a kiddie pool as a child, jumping from a rope swing with friends on a riverbank, and later wet t-shirt contests on spring break and skinny dipping with a girlfriend. He describes each situation as beginning a &quot;love affair with water.&quot;\n\n&quot;Water&quot; first charted in 2009 from unsolicited airplay received after its release, bringing it to #55 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. It also reached #9 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.\n\nUpon its release as a single, the song re-entered the country singles charts at #48 on the chart dated for the week ending March 27, 2010. and at #36 on the Canadian Radio &amp; Records Country Singles charts for the week of April 8, 2010. and at #100 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts for the week of April 30, 2010.\n\nAmerican Saturday Night is the seventh studio album by American country music artist Brad Paisley. It was released on June 30, 2009, by Arista Nashville. Like all of his previous studio albums, it is produced by Frank Rogers. The first single, &quot;Then,&quot; has become his fourteenth Number One on the Hot Country Songs chart. iTunes released songs from the album weekly as part of the countdown to the album's release. &quot;Water&quot; was released on June 9, 2009, followed by the title track on June 16 and &quot;Everybody's Here&quot; on June 23. The second radio single is &quot;Welcome to the Future.&quot; The title track was released as the third single on November 16, 2009.
