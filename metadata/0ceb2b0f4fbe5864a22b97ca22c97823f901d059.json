The Western Canada native launched her career with a blend of country-rock stylings and playfully punk-like attitude, by turns whimsical and subversive; back then, she practically put the alternative in alt-country. But from the very beginning, her bravura singing belied her kitschy cowgirl outfits and spiky hair; anyone lucky enough to attend very first appearance in the United States, on a triple bill of unsigned artists at New York City's Bottom Line, could hear that she was marked for greatness.\nAfter independently releasing A Truly Western Experience; on a Canadian label in 1984, which generated serious major-label interest in the States, lang joined Sire/Warner Bros. at the behest of Seymour Stein for her 1987 U.S. debut, Angel With A Lariat, produced by one-time Rockpile guitarist Dave Edmunds and cut with her then-band the Reclines. 1988 follow-up Shadowland brought langÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½rather daringlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½right to the heart of Nashville for a countrypolitan-themed collaboration helmed by legendary producer Owen Bradley, mentor to lang's idol, Patsy Cline, as well as to Brenda Lee. (In fact, Lee, Loretta Lynn, and Kitty Wells make a guest vocal appearance on the album's &quot;Honky Tonk Angels' Medley.&quot;) Though the Nashville establishment may have remained skeptical about lang, Shadowland reached #8 on the Billboard Country album chart.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kdlang.com/bio.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kdlang.com/bio.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease SEED and enjoy, thanks, thanks and thanks so mutch........!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ceb2b0f4fbe5864a22b97ca22c97823f901d059","amp;dn":"K.D.+Lang-3+cd-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ceb2b0f4fbe5864a22b97ca22c97823f901d059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,235,43,15,79,190,88,100,162,43,151,202,34,201,120,35,249,1,208,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
