Clyde McPhatter was one of\nthe greatest R&amp;B and Pop singers\nduring the 50s and 60s, and a\nhuge influence on the evolution of\nAmerican music. During his heyday,\nhis name and voice loomed so much\nlarger than that of the group The\nDrifters, which he founded, that it\ntook five years for them to recover\nfrom his departure. He is regarded\nas one of the top lead singers of\nall time and the second most\npopular black male vocalist of the\n50s, behind Fats Domino. Clyde was\na very strong influence on the Soul\nera that followed his prominence in\nthe music business. His remarkable\nhigh tenor influenced everyone from\nJackie Wilson and Smokey Robinson\nto Aaron Neville. Also, Clyde was\nthere during the very early days of\nRock n' Roll and made significant\ncontributions to building it into\nthe commercial success that it\nbecame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1385c24a66209fddbee8b11a31804156e696053","amp;dn":"Clyde_Mcphatter-Clyde_Plus_Rock_And_Roll-Remastered-2010-CFD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1385c24a66209fddbee8b11a31804156e696053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,56,92,36,166,98,9,253,219,238,139,17,163,24,4,21,110,105,96,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
