No. 2 Patrick Street picks up where their debut left off, though this time the group feels a little more comfortable in their own skin. \n\nAccordion player Arty McGlynn and fiddler Kevin Burke have become a single unit, utilizing their instrumental wizardry on each and every song. Like agreeable siblings, they burn through &quot;John Mckenna's Jig,&quot; &quot;Hard by Seifin/Woodcock Hill,&quot; and Jackie Daly's own &quot;Sweeney's Wheel&quot; with a fervor that is awe-inspiring. Vocalist Andy Irvine provides the record's most memorable tune, &quot;William Taylor.&quot; It's the tale of a woman who joins the British Navy in the guise of a man to rescue her betrothed, and features an infectious melody and strong playing (and singing) from the entire collective. Irvine also does a great reworking of Woody Guthrie's &quot;Tom Joad,&quot; and offers up his own politically charged anthem with &quot;Facing the Chair.&quot; Patrick Street, with their newfound confidence, have the potential to be a true force of nature within the burgeoning Celtic music scene, and the divine No.2 looks likely to pave the way for a third offering. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/07/andy-irvine/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d3f3e28b97b098903b4ece159f0f5cff17f9f6a","amp;dn":"Patrick+Street...No.+2+Patrick+Street%281988%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d3f3e28b97b098903b4ece159f0f5cff17f9f6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,63,62,40,185,123,9,137,3,180,236,225,89,240,245,207,241,127,159,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
