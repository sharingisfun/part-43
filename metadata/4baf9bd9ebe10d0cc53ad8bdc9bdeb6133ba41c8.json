His versatility further extends into the performance fields where he is just as much at home with jazz, the blues, popular music and with the classics.  One week, Andre may be heard playing jazz in a swank night club; the following week, he will be performing with one of the great symphony orchestras; and a little later on, you will find him conducting for a top Hollywood motionpicture score.  He is familiar to television viewers because of his guest appearances with Dinah Shore, Dean Martin, Steve Allen, Ernie Ford, Ernie Kovacs, Rosemary Clooney and others.  Andre has won Motion Picture Academy Awards for &quot;Gigi&quot; and for &quot;Porgy and Bess.&quot;  He also won a Grammy Award for his work with David Rose on the M-G-M record, &quot;Like Young,&quot; a song which Mr. Previn composed.  Another award-winner spotlighted in the album is Gerry Mulligan who has won the International Jazz Critics Award as the best baritone saxophone player for 1957, 1958 and 1959.  Gerry also plays a feature acting role in &quot;The Subterraneans.&quot;  This long-playing record is a collection of Previn's original compositions ( except for &quot;Cofee Time&quot; and for &quot;Should I&quot; ) from the sound track of Arthur Freed's Production &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; played by small, medium and large orchestras with solos by some of the foremost jazz artists in the country. ~ gerrymulligan.info\n\nI Want to Live:\nBaritonist Gerry Mulligan and a group of West Coast all-stars were heard throughout the soundtrack of the Susan Hayward movie I Want to Live.  Although not a soundtrack, this LP features six themes from the movie ( all composed by Johnny Mandel ) performed by the same musicians, who this time around get an opportunity to really stretch out.  Since the band is comprised of Mulligan, trumpeter Art Farmer, altoist Bud Shank, trombonist Frank Rossolino, pianist Pete Jolly, bassist Red Mitchell and drummer Shelly Manne, virtually all of the music is quite interesting with plenty of fine solos and hard-swinging. ~ Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nGerry Mulligan (Baritone Saxophone)\nArt Pepper (Alto Saxophone) - 1,3,4,6,8-10,12\nRed Mitchell (Double Bass) - 1,3,6,8,10,12-18\nShelly Manne (Drums) - 1-3,5-8,10-18\nAndre Previn (Piano, Arranger) - 1-11\nJack Sheldon (Trumpet) - 1,3,6,8,10,12\nBob Enevoldsen (Trombone) - 1,3,4,6,8-10\nBill Perkins (Tenor Saxophone) - 1,3,6,8,10\nArt Farmer (Trumpet) - 4,9,13-18\nCarmen McRae (Vocals) - 2,5,7,11\nBud Shank (Alto Saxophone) - 13-18\nFrank Rosolino (Trombone) - 13-18\nPete Jolly (Piano) - 13-18\nJohnny Mandel (Arranger) - 13-18\nBuddy Clark (Double Bass) - 4,9\nDave Bailey (Drums) - 4,9\nRuss Freeman (Piano) - 4,9,12\n\nGerry Mulligan - The Jazz Soundtracks Tracks:\n01  Why Are We Afraid?
