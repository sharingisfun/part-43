We were told it was a romantic tragedy but this movie portrays it quite different.\n\nWhen the movie begins the tragedy has already happened. We witness the burial of Mary Vetsera and see the funeral procession held for the Crown Prince. Soon we go back in time and we witness the depressed Crown Prince falling in love with the young Mary Vetsera. As the end comes near we are told that the tragedy was no suicide-pact but a political assassination.\n\nThe movie is in French, without subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f263e7730b370c542adfd121ede40250e8551d2","amp;dn":"Le+Secret+De+Mayerling%281949%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f263e7730b370c542adfd121ede40250e8551d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,38,62,119,48,179,112,197,66,173,253,18,30,222,64,37,14,133,81,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
