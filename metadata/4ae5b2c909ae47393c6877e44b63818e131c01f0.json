Doing so allows you to Generate mana, which allows you to use a variety of miracles, upgrade structures and create new Disciples. The game requires no disc to play and can be played online with just about anyone provided you set up a game. The single player random map games are a bit weak but the good and evil campaigns are fairly fun and the game has a lot of colorful humor and nice cutscenes.\n\nInstallation: Installation is simple, just mount, run install, and play. I suggest\nDaemon Tools or PowerIso but it is simply a point of preference.\n\nScanned and Clean: I uploaded this torrent after seeing that another, provided with\na rather gruesome picture I might add, came loaded with malware, stealth viruses and trojans. If you had the misfortune of trying to install that other one I strongly suggest doing a thorough virus scan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae5b2c909ae47393c6877e44b63818e131c01f0","amp;dn":"Heaven+%26+Hell+-+Live+and+Let+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae5b2c909ae47393c6877e44b63818e131c01f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,229,178,201,9,174,71,57,60,104,119,228,75,99,129,142,19,28,1,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
