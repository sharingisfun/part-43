This album has completely dropped any sense of heaviness whatsoever. You will not hear one song on this album with even the hint of their metal past. This album is hypnotizing, beautiful, dark, ambient, serene.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a music for quite evening.\n\nAll tracks are separate &amp; with tags. Ripped by EAC. Torrent contain full booklet. All pictures in booklet is 300 pixels/inch.\nIf you want to burn this CD, you can download cole2K nero audio plug-in (google helps you), or use alcohol, EAC  etc. \nI can't seed all the time, but I'll seed every night, till someone downloads. Just wait. I'll be happy if you seed few days after download.\nIf you think you want something else, just tell me here.\n\nP.S. Sorry for my bad English. I'm Russian.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634811b4ccfee97c8d081b236a9f9932552994da","amp;dn":"The+Gathering+-+Home+%5BFLAC%5D+%2B+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634811b4ccfee97c8d081b236a9f9932552994da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,72,17,180,204,254,233,124,141,8,27,35,106,159,153,50,85,41,148,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
