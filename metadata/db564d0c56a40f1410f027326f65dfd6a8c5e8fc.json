When Won Miho is sent to the island to teach, the biggest problem she expects to face is a shortage of designer clothing stores. Unfortunately for her, she's about to come face to face with the dark side of Cheju. Here, carnal demons and ancient gods play with mortals to satisfy their lusts-and they've chosen Miho as their next target! In order to survive the horrors that seek her blood, Miho must team up with the mysterious Pan, whose enchanted knife and mastery of magic makes him the only one capable of killing these demons. But what Miho's about to find out is that her savior might be more dangerous than the demons! \n\nWritten by In-wan Youn and illustrated by Kyung-il Yang.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db564d0c56a40f1410f027326f65dfd6a8c5e8fc","amp;dn":"Island+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db564d0c56a40f1410f027326f65dfd6a8c5e8fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,86,77,12,86,164,15,20,16,240,39,50,111,101,223,214,168,197,232,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
