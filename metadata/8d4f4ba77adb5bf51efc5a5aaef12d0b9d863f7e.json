He appears to have nearly perfected the art on Declaration, his most upbeat and polished effort to date. For example, songs like &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and &quot;God Is God&quot; aren't just pop songs but sweeping mini-epics of faith that are carried along by Chapman's passionate vocals and crashing crescendos. He's also adept at sprinkling modern references to freshen his hard-rock motif, such as the lyrical tip of the hat to news events in 2000 on the opener, &quot;Live Out Loud,&quot; and the Nintendo Game Boy sound effects on &quot;See the Glory.&quot; Of course, Chapman has long known how to massage those melancholy hearts with such balladry as &quot;Carry You to Jesus&quot; and &quot;Savior.&quot; Clearly, Declaration raises a bar that was already beyond reach for most of his contemporaries. Chapman is a brilliant songwriter with a finger on the pulse of what today's Christian music fans want to hear.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d4f4ba77adb5bf51efc5a5aaef12d0b9d863f7e","amp;dn":"Steven+Curtis+Chapman+-+2001+-+Declaration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d4f4ba77adb5bf51efc5a5aaef12d0b9d863f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,79,75,167,122,219,91,245,30,252,90,90,174,241,45,11,157,134,63,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
