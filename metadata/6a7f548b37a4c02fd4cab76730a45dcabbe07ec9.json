George, a furrier who raised chinchillas and supplied furs to the movie studios.\n\nGeorge's first instrument was the harmonica. At the age of 6 he appeared on the Ted Mack's Original Amateur Hour performing a duet with his older brother, Hampton. At Hollywood High School Lowell took up the flute in the school marching band and orchestra. He started to play guitar at age 11, continued with the harmonica, and later learned to play the saxophone and sitar. He played guitar with fellow schoolmate, and future bandmate, Paul Barrere.\n\nGeorge's first band, the Factory, formed in 1965. Members included future Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward (he replaced Dallas Taylor in Sept 1966), and Martin Kibbee (a.k.a. Fred Martin) who would later co-write several Little Feat songs with George, including &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; and &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Doctor&quot;. Frank Zappa produced two tracks for the Factory. The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom F Troop as &quot;The Bed Bugs&quot;.\n\nFollowing the disbanding of the Factory, George briefly joined the band The Standells. There followed a few months in late 1968 to early 1969 where George was a member of Zappa's band, the Mothers of Invention and can be heard on both the album Weasels Ripped My Flesh, and playing guitar and singing on several tracks on the first disc of Zappa's You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5, including a version of &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;, with Lowell as lead vocalist. George also joined Peter Tork in his first post-Monkee band &quot;Release&quot;.\n\nAfter leaving the Mothers of Invention, George invited fellow musicians to form a new band, which they named Little Feat. George usually (but not always) played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar. Ry Cooder played the slide on the original Little Feat recording, although George re-recorded some of his material. Mark Brend wrote that it was George's &quot;use of compression defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines.&quot;\n\nOutside of his band, George played guitar on John Cale's 1973 album Paris 1919, Harry Nilsson's Son of Schmilsson album (Take 54) and (uncredited but verified by Leo Nocentelli) The Meters' &quot;Just Kissed My Baby&quot; in 1974.\n\nIn the 1970s, Little Feat released a series of studio albums: Little Feat, Sailin' Shoes, Dixie Chicken, Feats Don't Fail Me Now, The Last Record Album, and Time Loves A Hero. The group's 1978 live album Waiting for Columbus became their best-selling album.\n\nIn an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted eleven days before his death, George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Bill Payne and Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re in order to reassert his full control over the group. Due to tensions within the group, especially between George and Payne and, to a lesser extent, BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, regarding musical direction and leadership, Payne and BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re left the group in 1979.\n\nGeorge was also a producer, and produced the Grateful Dead's 1978 album Shakedown Street, as well as Little Feat's records, Valerie Carter's 1977 release Just A Stone's Throw Away, and George's 1979 solo album Thanks, I'll Eat it Here.\n\nOn June 15, 1979, George began a tour in support of his solo album. George fell ill in his Arlington, Virginia hotel room and died on June 29, 1979. An autopsy showed that he died of an accidental drug overdose. Lowell George's body was cremated in Washington, D.C. on August 2. His ashes were flown back to Los Angeles, where they were scattered in the Pacific Ocean from his fishing boat.\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nAlthough they do not play together on any single track, Richie Hayward and Bill Payne, both members of Little Feat, play on the album. George was also able to call on the services of top-class session players and backing vocalists.\n\nLowell George - Guitar, Vocals and Production\nBonnie Raitt - Vocals\nJames Newton Howard - keyboards\nChuck Rainey - Bass\nDenny Christianson - Keyboards\nDavid Foster - Keyboards\nChilli Charles - Drums\nNicky Hopkins - Keyboards &amp; Horn\nJim Price - Horn\nJim Keltner - Drums\nJim Gordon - Drums\nMichael Baird - Drums &amp; Bass\nDennis Belfield - Bass\nBobby Bruce - Violin, Guitar\nTurner Stephen Bruton - Guitar &amp; Horn\nDennis Christianson - Horn\nLuis Damian - Guitar &amp; keyboards\nGordon DeWitte - Keyboards &amp; Piano\nMaxine Dixon - Piano\nArthur Gerst - Piano\nJimmy Greenspoon - Guitar, Piano\nRoberto Gutierrez - Vocals, Guitar, Drums\nRichard Hayward - Drums\nJerry Jumonville - Saxophone &amp; Guitar\nRon Koss - Guitar &amp; Engineering\nDarrell Leonard - Horn &amp; Vocals\nMaxayn Lewis - Vocals\nDavid Paich - Drums\nJeff Porcaro - Drums, guitar\nDean Parks - Guitar &amp; keyboards\nBruce Paulson - Keyboards\nBill Payne - Keyboards &amp; Vocals\nHerb Pedersen - Vocals\nJoel Peskin - Vocals &amp; Saxophone\nJohn Phillips - Saxophone &amp; Drums\nPeggy Sandvig, Jim Self - Drums\nFloyd Sneed - Drums &amp; Vocals\nJ.D.
