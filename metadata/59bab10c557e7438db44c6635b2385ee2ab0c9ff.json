Ask Roy Zimmerman. He's been writing satirical songs for twenty years. The Los Angeles Times says, &quot;Zimmerman displays a lacerating wit and keen awareness of society's foibles that bring to mind a latter-day Tom Lehrer.&quot;\n\nTom Lehrer himself says, &quot;I congratulate Roy Zimmerman on reintroducing literacy to comedy songs. And the rhymes actually rhyme, they don't just 'rhyne.'&quot; Joni Mitchell says, &quot;Roy's lyrics move beyond poetry and achieve perfection.&quot; There's a decidedly Lefty slant to his lyrics. &quot;We used to have a name for Right Wing satire,&quot; he says. &quot;We called it 'cruelty.'&quot;\n\nZimmerman has played clubs across the country, and shared the stage with George Carlin, Bill Maher, Kate Clinton, Dennis Miller, Sandra Tsing Loh, kd lang, Andy Borowitz and Paul Krassner. He's done several shows with The Pixies' Frank Black, swapping songs in a solo acoustic setting. His up-to-the-moment topical songs are featured on American Public Media's syndicated broadcast &quot;Weekend America&quot; and Sirius Radio's &quot;West Coast Live.&quot;\n\nComic Sutra (1998).
