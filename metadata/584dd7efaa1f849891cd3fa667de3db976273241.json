In contrast to the more avantgarde and spaced out experiments of K.D., M.o.t.W.'s albums have a more conventional and familiar approach to rock music. This sounds entirely superficial and should only be seen as a sketchy comparison between these two very eclectic and baffling projects. \n\nIn 2003 M.o.t.W. disbanded, but partly rejoined for a last time in 2009 to record the free of charge available album &quot;Part the Second&quot;.\n\n\nAlbums (with bonus tracks):\n\n1999 - My Fruit Psychobells...
