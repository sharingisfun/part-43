Much of this material is in the vein of Duncan's classic work with Bob Wills, though the quality of the music is slightly inconsistent. Nevertheless, Texas Moon and its companion volume Beneath a Neon Star in a Honk Tonk, are necessary for hardcore collectors of western swing in general and Duncan in particular. \n\nBear Family CD.
