He was a star in the 1960s, dropped into obscurity for twenty years and then returned to the limelight. For fifty years, this soulful artist has composed songs in a unique style marked by historical events such as the independence of Mali, and his own life story, songs with a serene and melancholy air. When TraorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© talks about Mali Denhou, his eighth album, he highlights the importance of peace - to be at peace with yourself, with history, the ancestors, the entire country. His age? The question makes him chuckle like a young man: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAh noÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a secret!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Kar-Kar, as heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s known, can be both serious and playful - he has a twinkle in his eye when he talks about his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“oldiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ - the great hits ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Kar-Kar MadisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mali TwistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and when he exclaims ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMali Denhou was recorded in just one day in the studio!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Some of the tracks have been playing in his mind since the 1960s, and others, such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Dundobesse MÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢BedouniatoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, are new. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn that song I say IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve had my time in this world, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s it! One day, I will have to go. One day a man is having a glorious time, and the next, he is gone, he becomes nothing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The words are inspired by his life, one marked by great success as well as disappointments.\n\nBoubacar TraorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was born in Kayes, in Western Mali, to a noble family. As a youth he was an exceptional football player with the promise of a great sporting career ahead. Then an injury put an end to those dreams in the late 1950s. Goodbye football: all he kept was his nick-name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKar-KarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (the dribbler). He learnt guitar with his brother and developed his own style. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI play guitar as though it were a koraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he explains. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy playing is inspired by the Manding style, I play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“double scaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ His 1963 song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Mali TwistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ was broadcast several times a day on national radio, becoming a post-independence anthem and a huge hit with the young generation. It was this song which made him a star in the 60s. But his fame earned him nothing so he started working as a tailor. Everyone in Mali thought he was dead. Apart from a surprise television appearance in 1987 he remained in obscurity, and when his beloved wife Pierrette passed away he left for France for a number of years. Later he returned to Kayes where he ran a little store. In 1989 he was tracked down by some journalists from Radio Mali, recorded his first cassette and went to perform in the UK and France. In Mali he was welcomed back to the music scene with open arms, releasing several albums and becoming a crucial figure in Malian music. He was also a reminder of the lowly status sometimes conferred on musicians in Africa. So Mali Denhou is also a message: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt should be recognised that I did a lot for my country in the 1960s,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ concludes Kar Kar. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe leaders should protect musicians and their art! ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thanks to them that the name of Mali has crossed all the rivers in the world!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTracklisting:\n \n1. (00:06:05) M'Badeou\n2.
