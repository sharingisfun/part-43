OK, it will probably not overthrow Toro y Moi or Neon Indian (heck, it does not even sound very similar, more like a combination of post-rock and synth-pop), but still, it is great stuff, very atmospheric. Recommended especially if you are into the lo-fi side of things.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Deerfield Village (4:32)\n2. Golden Triangles (2:44)\n3. Bear Creek (3:33)\n4. Brook Meadows (3:24)\n5.
