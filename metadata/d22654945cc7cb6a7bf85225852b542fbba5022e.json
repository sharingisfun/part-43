Mention politics, philosophy, law, medicine, history, even the visual arts, and we barely scratch the surface of what we owe this extraordinary culture.\n\nHow can we best learn about these people who have given us so much; who have deepened and enriched our understanding of ourselves?\n\nWe can look to modern historians for perspectives on the origins of their own discipline, and on the two thinkers, Herodotus and Thucydides, whose contributions to that discipline were immense. To political scientists for the links between the U.S. Senate and the councils of Athens. And to teachers of philosophy for insights to illuminate the deepest implications found in Plato.\n\nBut there is an entirely different perspective found in another of their great legaciesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the classic Greek literature that is still read today and that is still able to engage and enthrall us. Would we find that Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plato might engage us in advanced levels of understanding when their works are examined as not only history or philosophy, but as literature, their words weighed and forms shaped as carefully as those of any poem or drama?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22654945cc7cb6a7bf85225852b542fbba5022e","amp;dn":"TTC+Masterpieces+of+Ancient+Greek+Literature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d22654945cc7cb6a7bf85225852b542fbba5022e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,38,84,148,92,199,203,106,123,248,82,37,133,43,84,47,187,165,2,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
