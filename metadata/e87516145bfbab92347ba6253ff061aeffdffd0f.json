While walking away from home, Betty and Bimbo wind up in a spooky area, and hide in a hollow tree. A ghost walrusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whose gyrations were rotoscoped from footage of Calloway dancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½appears to them, and begins to sing &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, with many fellow ghosts following along. After singing the whole number, the ghosts chase Betty and Bimbo all the way back to Betty's home. While Betty is hiding under the covers of her bedsheets, her runaway note is torn up and the remaining letters read &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;.\nProduced in 1932\nProducer: Max Fleischer\nAudio/Visual: sound, b/w","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e87516145bfbab92347ba6253ff061aeffdffd0f","amp;dn":"Betty+Boop+-+Minnie+the+Moocher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e87516145bfbab92347ba6253ff061aeffdffd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,117,22,20,91,251,171,146,52,123,166,37,63,240,97,174,255,223,253,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
