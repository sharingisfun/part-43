Goal was &quot;preview&quot; quality, not the ultimate one - what is self-evident from redicolously small file-size. Trade-offs must be included.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nFor example; when I finish encoding, I always check out the file, do short preview, rewinding back and forth. It usualy looks ugly - but - then I move back and sit on the sofa, 6 feet away - and everything looks as it should. Nice and watchable, like on older, analog TV set.\n\nPLEASE, think about the ones who have Internet but cannot afford download of big files.\nEvery day I have 10% of my peers on dial-up and ancient hardware who need whole day to download a &quot;normal&quot; sized 350MB.\nPlease, I beg you for understanding of my work, let them through and if you can - help them by downloading and seeding afterward as long as you can. These people have slow download and it helps them a lot (please, be generous - on such file having ratio 10.7:1 is like 1:1 on normal-sized XviD).. \nExample for the ones looking more on ratio numbers, than real and &quot;generated&quot; traffic (ones who need to save - skip this, its just an example):\n&gt;&gt;XviD's downloading 350MB: giving back 350MB equals 700MB (1:1 ratio)\n&gt;&gt;[quark]'s is ~60MB + 11 times 60 = 660 MB equals 720MB (well... 20 MB &quot;more&quot;)\nSo, people who can give more, should not be focused on plain ratio-number too much - in &quot;world&quot; of [quarks] many things are different.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n***************************************************************************++\n\nGeneral #0\nComplete name        : Lost.S06E12.H264[quark].mp4\nFormat/Family        : MPEG-4\nFile size            : 65.7 MiB\nPlayTime             : 41mn 11s\nBit rate             : 223 Kbps\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : H.264\nCodec/Info           : H.264 (3GPP)\nPlayTime             : 41mn 11s\nBit rate             : 206 Kbps\nWidth                : 352 pixels\nHeight               : 192 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 23.976 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.123\nStreamSize           : 60.6 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : AAC LC-SBR-PS\nCodec/Info           : AAC Low Complexity with Spectral Band Replication and Parametric Stereo\nPlayTime             : 41mn 11s\nBit rate             : 16 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : VBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 22 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc91eb89648f8ef79526a6c6b8d2e80481ea2192","amp;dn":"Lost.S06E12.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc91eb89648f8ef79526a6c6b8d2e80481ea2192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,145,235,137,100,143,142,247,149,38,166,198,184,210,232,4,129,234,33,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
