He adopts another identity in the form of Peter Franks. He joins up with Tiffany Case, and acts as if he is smuggling the diamonds, but everyone is hungry for these diamonds. He also has to avoid Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, the dangerous couple who does not leave anyone in their way. Ernst Stavro Blofeld isn't out of the question. He may have changed his looks, but is he linked with the heist? And if he is, can Bond finally defeat his ultimate enemy.\n\n\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 614 MiB\nDuration : 1h 59mn\nOverall bit rate : 716 Kbps\nWriting application : MEncoder SVN-r29352(20090610-gcc4.3.3)\nWriting library : MPlayer\n\nVideo\nFormat : avc1\nCodec ID : avc1\nDuration : 1h 59mn\nBit rate : 576 Kbps\nWidth : 480 pixels\nHeight : 360 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.133\nStream size : 494 MiB (80%)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 59mn\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 110 MiB (18%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 26 ms (0.65 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 522 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.98","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aac13f3da7b34e7ddbaf4d692f29dcc2ce86dbc","amp;dn":"James+Bond+-+007+-+Diamonds+Are+Forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aac13f3da7b34e7ddbaf4d692f29dcc2ce86dbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,172,19,243,218,123,52,231,221,186,244,214,146,242,157,204,44,232,109,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
