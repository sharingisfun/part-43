He evokes in vivid detail his own musical childhood in New England, with its marching bands and small-town orchestras, and describes his start as a serious composer in college, his cross-country journey to California, and his gradual rise as one of the most important figures in American music.\n\nHallelujah Junction is not only a deeply personal recollection but also a firsthand encounter with many of the emblematic themes and personalities of contemporary culture. Here you will find incisive and witty commentaries on people ranging from the Beatles, Leonard Bernstein, Duke Ellington, John Cage, Steve Reich, and Frank Zappa to Allen Ginsberg, Chairman Mao, and Richard Nixon. A work of national scope and intimate dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tail, this is a winning, memorable bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a landmark in American arts and letters.\n\nJohn Adams was born and raised in New England, and was exposed to both classical and jazz music from an early age. After graduating from Harvard, he moved to San Francisco and has lived in northern California ever since. The composer of richly scored and expressive symphonic works such as Harmonium, Harmonielehre, Shaker Loops, and Naive and Sentimental Music and some of the most controversial and successful operas in recent memory (among them Nixon in China, The Death of Klinghoffer, El Nino, and Doctor Atomic), he has one of the most compelling musical voices of our time.\n\nJacket photograph of John Adams by Margaretta K.
