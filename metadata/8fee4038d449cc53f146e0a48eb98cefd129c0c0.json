America smokes a lot of pot, America drinks a lot of booze, and pot has not always been outlawed--it stands to reason that law and culture will change again. This book seems to herald that change is now upon us. It is smart and clear and feels like common sense. Pot and drink are two drugs people commonly use and one causes a good deal more violence and tragedy. Let's at least legalize the other one. It's an excellent argument. But don't just take my word for it--read the book.&quot;\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jennifer Michael Hecht, PhD, author of The Happiness Myth\n\nNationally recognized marijuana-policy experts Steve Fox, Paul Armentano, and Mason Tvert compare and contrast the relative harms and legal status of the two most popular recreational substances in the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½marijuana and alcohol. Through an objective examination of the two drugs and the laws and social practices that steer people toward alcohol, the authors pose a simple yet rarely considered question: Why do we punish adults who make the rational, safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol?\n\nMarijuana Is Safer reaches for a broad audience. For those unfamiliar with marijuana, it provides an introduction to the cannabis plant and its effects on the user, and debunks some of the government's most frequently cited marijuana myths. For current and aspiring advocates of marijuana-law reform, as well as anyone else who is interested in what is becoming a major political battle, the authors spell out why the message that marijuana is safer than alcohol must be a prominent part of the public debate over legalization.\n\nMost importantly, for the millions of Americans who want to advance the cause of marijuana-policy reformÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or simply want to defend their own personal, safer choiceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this book provides the talking points and detailed information needed to make persuasive arguments to friends, family, coworkers, and elected officials.\n\nAbout the Authors\n\nPaul Armentano\n\nPaul Armentano is the deputy director of NORML (The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws) and the NORML Foundation.
