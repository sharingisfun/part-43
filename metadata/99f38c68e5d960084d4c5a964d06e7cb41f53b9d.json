Where Taylor's more\nreflective passages tend often to preview bombast and iconoclasm writ large,\nIrene Schweizer's approach to the piano seems more reflectiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more prone to\nrumination on an idea or a fragment of an ideaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and it makes for music that holds\nthe attention more by stealth than by sheer impact. Over the course of these\nnineteen minutes, there isn't a second that's wasted.\n\nThere might be no little irony in a title like &quot;Into The Hall Of Fame,&quot; but\nSchweizer seems to adopt a more expansive approach here. The results reveal her\nidiosyncratic way with a phrase and the fact that her instrumental voice, having\nspent decades in gestation, is entirely her own.\n\nIrony might not have been too far from her thoughts with &quot;Scratching At The\nKKL,&quot; either. It's the only time she goes under the piano lid, an act which in\nitself reveals just how deep her intuitive grasp of dynamics can be; her\nmanipulation of strings is deft, and the low volume of the sounds she produces\ncould well serve as a musical example of Samuel Beckett's declared wish &quot;to\nleave a stain upon the silence.&quot;\n\nReference has to be made to the exceptional fidelity of this recording, which\nindeed seems to be a growing characteristic of Intakt releases. This is arguably\nmost apparent here on &quot;The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Piano Player,&quot; where\nthe variations of Schweizer's touch are abundantly apparent.\n\nA real mark of this disc is the degree of difference between the surface of the\nmusic and what lies beneath it. With that in mind, it can almost serve as\nbackground in the sense of being complementary to some activity other than\nlistening itselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but deeper listening reveals the work of a fierce musical\nintelligence, however, and is by far the preferable alternative.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f38c68e5d960084d4c5a964d06e7cb41f53b9d","amp;dn":"Irene+Schweizer+-+First+Choice.+Piano+Solo+KKL+Luzern+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f38c68e5d960084d4c5a964d06e7cb41f53b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,243,140,104,229,217,96,8,77,76,90,150,77,6,231,203,65,245,59,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
