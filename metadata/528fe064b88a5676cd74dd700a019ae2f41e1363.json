Death Scenes \ndoesn't seek any glamour, confort or sensationalism. It presents death as it is \n(not how it should be); and it surely isn't a flattering thing. Anton LaVey \n(who worked as a crime scene photographer) does a good job as a narrator, \nexplaining each &quot;scenes&quot; with a dead calm voice. I cannot recommend Death \nScenes for everyone - especially for those who're weak minded (or heart). \n\nfilename:       Death.Scenes.I.Manson.DVDRip.XviD-T3.avi\nfilesize:       732,463,104\nvideo codec:    XviD ISO MPEG-4\nvideo bitrate:  1049kbps\nbits per pixel: 0.288\nduration:       1:23:57\nresolution:     400*304\nfps:            29.970\nframe count:    150952\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  101kbps VBR\naudio channels: 2\nAudio Tracks:   1 [1-Main Movie]\nLanguage:       English\nSubtitles:      None\nsource:         Anthem Pictures R1 DVD\nimdb:          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140945/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140945/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAs stated above, these rips are sourced from the Anthem Pictures R1 DVD releases \n(though the DVDs are obviously themselves sourced from VHS, you can see a noise \nbar at the bottom throughout the videos).
