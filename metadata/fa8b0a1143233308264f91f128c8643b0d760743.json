Is this acceptable to God? How is this &quot;good news&quot;? \n\nTroubling questionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so troubling that many have lost their faith because of them. Others only whisper the questions to themselves, fearing or being taught that they might lose their faith and their church if they ask them out loud. \n\nBut what if these questions trouble us for good reason? What if the story of heaven and hell we have been taught is not, in fact, what the Bible teaches? What if what Jesus meant by heaven, hell, and salvation are very different from how we have come to understand them? \n\nWhat if it is God who wants us to face these questions? \n\nAuthor, pastor, and innovative teacher Rob Bell presents a deeply biblical vision for rediscovering a richer, grander, truer, and more spiritually satisfying way of understanding heaven, hell, God, Jesus, salvation, and repentance. The result is the discovery that the &quot;good news&quot; is much, much better than we ever imagined. \n\nLove wins. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa8b0a1143233308264f91f128c8643b0d760743","amp;dn":"Rob+Bell%3A+Love+Wins+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa8b0a1143233308264f91f128c8643b0d760743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,139,10,17,67,35,51,8,38,79,145,241,40,200,100,59,13,118,7,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
