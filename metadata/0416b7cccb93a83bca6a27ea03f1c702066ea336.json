The programme features interviews with the two finalists, Daniel Libeskind and Rafael Vignoly.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0416b7cccb93a83bca6a27ea03f1c702066ea336","amp;dn":"Towering+Ambitions+-+Dan+Cruickshank+at+Ground+Zero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0416b7cccb93a83bca6a27ea03f1c702066ea336","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,22,183,204,203,147,168,59,202,106,39,234,3,241,199,2,6,110,163,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
