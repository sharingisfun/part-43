But scientific evidence tells a very different story:\n\nWhen Columbus stepped ashore in 1492, millions of people were already living there. America wasn't exactly a &quot;New World,&quot; but a very old one whose inhabitants had built a vast infrastructure of cities, orchards, canals and causeways. But after Columbus set foot in the Americas, an endless wave of explorers, conquistadors and settlers arrived, and with each of their ships came a Noah's Ark of plants, animalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and disease. In the first 100 years of contact, entire civilizations were wiped out and the landscape was changed forever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by : Victor Garber \n===========================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Written by: Cristina Trebbi \n======================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    America Before Columbus\nYear.................:    2009\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:31:52\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1803 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    1.15 GB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2009\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1552976/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1552976/&lt;/a&gt;   \n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54f15810c9ae3a2b8ca57f68540f5d59e6ea815a","amp;dn":"America+Before+Columbus-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54f15810c9ae3a2b8ca57f68540f5d59e6ea815a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,241,88,16,201,174,58,43,140,165,127,104,84,15,93,89,230,234,129,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
