The quartet reunites Planxty founders Donal Lunny --the record's producer -- Andy Irvine, and Arty McGlynn, as well as the Bothy Band fiddler Kevin Burke, and De Danaan guitar player Jackie Daly. Their eponymous debut is a ten-song juggernaut of original and traditional material that showcases all of the member's talents equally. Burke, a master of the Cape Breton style of fiddling as well as traditional Irish playing, displays his chops on the sprightly &quot;French Canadian Set &quot;Le Cardeuse,&quot; and effortlessly works his way through Celtic standards like &quot;Loftus Jones.&quot; Irvine, a peerless ballad writer who composed the majority of Planxty's finest songs, is the group's primary vocalist and lends his rich voice to the Midwest lament &quot;The Dream/Indiana,&quot; Tommy Sands' &quot;Man With the Cap,&quot; and Gerry O'Beirne's &quot;Holy Ground.&quot; This is impeccably played music that offers little in the way of daring, but to call Patrick Street the band's weakest album is still a compliment, as it remains leagues above the countless others in its' genre. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/07/andy-irvine/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec5232163fe0f8e7d4bff1a4a35a5d2c088f755","amp;dn":"Patrick+Street....Patrick+Street%281986%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec5232163fe0f8e7d4bff1a4a35a5d2c088f755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,197,35,33,99,254,15,142,125,75,255,26,74,53,165,210,192,136,247,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
