Stupidity sets out to determine whether our culture is hooked on deliberate ignorance as a strategy for success. From Adam Sandler to George W. Bush, from the IQ test to TV programming, to the origins of the word moron, Stupidity examines the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of contemporary culture. Stupidity embarks on an exhaustive search into its meaning, and the implications of a culture that is obsessed and saturated with stupefying culture. Stupidity careens at warp speed through sound bites on topics from television news and reality TV shows, to Internet sites and popular films. Featuring opinions and comments from some of today's most recognizable figures, cultural critics, authors and academics, including John Cleese, Noam Chomsky, Selma Hayek and Bill Maher, Stupidity reveals that, despite our culture's extensive access to knowledge and information, humans continue to choose stupidity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b00ef67ab01320f1f0fa0a5d2733e4e3cc97fc27","amp;dn":"stupidity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b00ef67ab01320f1f0fa0a5d2733e4e3cc97fc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,14,246,122,176,19,32,241,240,250,10,93,39,51,228,227,204,151,252,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
