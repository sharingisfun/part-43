With the industry seemingly insistent that bands burst forth fully-formed, firing on all cylinders from the word go, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s practically career suicide for your first album to merely suggest potential rather than scream instant magnificence. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exactly what we get with the Copenhagen foursomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-titled debut. Treefight For Sunlight isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a knockout success, but it just about contains enough to suggest that, if thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s any justice, the Danes deserve a second crack of the whip.\n\nOn paper, theirs is a beguiling proposition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ imagine a slightly cartoonish take on Sixties West Coast psychedelia, augmented by vocal layers reminiscent of MGMT or Panda Bear. Indeed, the enchanting curtain raiser ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A Dream Before SleepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ does a good job of whetting the appetite. But as first song proper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You And The New WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ moves into focus, the excitement levels are quickly dampened. It has decent ear-candy value, so isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t completely without charm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but as a song, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a non-starter.\n\nAnd the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a real mixed bag from here on. The bright and breezy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Facing The SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is enjoyable, if a little lightweight, yet itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sandwiched between the utterly forgettable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“They Never Did KnowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the so-jaunty-itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s-actually-quite-annoying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Rain AirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not to say that all the jauntiness is unwelcome, though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the rousing sing-along ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“What Became Of You And IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is by some distance the album highlight, even though itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be far better suited to CBBC than to the Brixton Academy.\n\nWith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Time StretcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the record ends on an uncharacteristically intense, broody note. But while it means the album lacks a satisfying pay-off, it also signals a path via which Treefight For Sunlight can develop and mature. But with their debut album being so patchy, they may not be given the chance.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/20/treefight-for-sunlight/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44abab0c85d6573dca6f2f4ad071182b06e34fca","amp;dn":"Treefight+for+Sunlight...Treefight+For+Sunlight%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44abab0c85d6573dca6f2f4ad071182b06e34fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,171,171,12,133,214,87,61,202,111,47,74,208,113,24,43,6,227,79,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
