From the fringes of the galaxy to our own backyards, the UFO FILES searches for evidence of life beyond our world. Tracing the long, convoluted history of UFO encounters and research, this unique series opens new windows into the controversial field.\n\nTo the cognoscenti, they are known as USOs--unidentified submerged objects, supposedly otherworldly vessels capable of operating underwater. Some say they have been reported for centuries. THE UFO FILES examines ancient records and plunges into the depths around the world to investigate this mystery. Highlights include the 1967 &quot;Shag Harbour Incident&quot;, a government-documented USO crash off the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada, and a trip to the area around Laguna Cartegena in Puerto Rico, a reported hotbed of USO activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Jon Alon Walz\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Deep Sea Ufos\nYear:  2006\nFile Size: 698 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:45:01\nVideo Codec: DivX5\nVideo Resolution: 656x480\nVIdeo Bitrate:  2170 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n \n \n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view chance the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc557ac1ca27815c9bc16361d75aac745fb7edd","amp;dn":"Deep+Sea+Ufos-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc557ac1ca27815c9bc16361d75aac745fb7edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,197,87,172,28,162,120,21,201,188,22,54,29,117,170,199,69,251,126,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
