Now she knows.\n\nPOtHS 2 - Survival Series - Part 27 - Gracie - Bully Proof\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech  --  High Speed Server\n\n\nEvery day in the United States, an estimated 150,000 kids miss school due to fear or intimidation of bullies. In fact, many believe that fear of bullying may be the leading cause of low self-esteem in children. Worse, statistics suggest that less than 15% of kids actually report acts of bullying.\n\nChildren's inability to stand up to a bully is rooted in profound fear for their personal safety. The victims know that they must confront the bully and would like nothing more than to stand up to them. But, they simply can't follow through for fear of the physical harm that backs the bully's every action. And, therein lies the challenge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how do you instill in a victim of bullying the confidence to face the tormentor, look them in the eye, and back them down? The answer is simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ teach the victims to defend themselves against physical attack, and the rest will follow\n\nMost martial arts programs rely on striking the attacker with violent punches, kicks, knees, and elbows. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, we take a different approach. All the techniques are purely defensive and utilize no strikes. Furthermore, we teach children how defuse confrontations with words and never to initiate physical aggression. If attacked, we offer techniques to non-violently neutralize the threat and gain control until help arrives. In the Gracie Bullyproof program, we teach the children how to fight fire with water.\n\nThe Gracie Bullyproof program has three objectives:\n\n  1. Instill Confidence: Bullies are less likely to target self-confident children. We instill confidence by teaching techniques that will neutralize the attack of a larger opponent.\n  2. Increase Awareness: Harassment from bullies can be physical or verbal and delivered at various intensity levels. In each lesson, we focus on teaching your child to recognize and respond to the most common physical and verbal bully behaviors.\n  3. Ensure Readiness: Only when your child makes it clear that he/she will not tolerate the harassment, will they free themselves of the bullyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s torment. We will prepare them for every common contingency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what is coming and more.\nIf you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 01 - Woodmaster Survival Skills\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 02 - The Edible Garden\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 03 - Ray Mears - World of Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 04 - Ray Mears - Country Tracks\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 05 - Ray Mears - Extreme Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 06 - Ray Mears - Real Heroes of Telemark\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 07 - Ray Mears - Bushcraft Series\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 08 - Ray Mears - Wild Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 09 - 50 Outdoor Skills ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Basic\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 10 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 11 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE2\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 12 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE3\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 13 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE4\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 14 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE5\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 15 - Growing Your Own Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 16 - Growing Your Own Drugs\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 17 - Permaculture and Organic Gardening\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 18 - Old McDonalds Backyard Farm\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 19 - First Aid - Includes Gunshot Wounds\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 20 - Make you own Electricity\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 21 - More Food Farming\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 22 - Pure Water for Life\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 23 - Self Defense - Easy Stuff for Beginners\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 24 - Self Defense - Street Survival &amp; Hapkido Self-Defense\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 25 - Self Defense - Krav Mag\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 26 - Firearm Tactics 2.1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 27 - Gracie - Bully Proof\n\n\n\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMore Torrents in this series at          ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
