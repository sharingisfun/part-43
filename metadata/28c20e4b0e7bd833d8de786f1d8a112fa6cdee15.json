It follows the adventures of a small stuffed bear  named Bear and his roommate/antagonist, a psychotic housecat named Looshkin. Looshkin often plays cruel, sadistic, and nonsensical pranks on Bear, and it is not uncommon for faeces and dismemberment  to come into play.\n\nSmart's linework is bold and expressive, and his panels are littered with information and throw-away gags. The stories are marked by a combination of violent shocks, random silliness, and other hallmarks of Dada.\n\nDue to mature themes and swearing this torrent comes with an ADULT rating.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c20e4b0e7bd833d8de786f1d8a112fa6cdee15","amp;dn":"Bear+%28SLG%29+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c20e4b0e7bd833d8de786f1d8a112fa6cdee15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,194,14,75,14,123,216,51,216,222,120,111,29,138,17,47,166,205,238,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
