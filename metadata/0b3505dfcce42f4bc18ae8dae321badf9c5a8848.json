He is known both for his work as leader and songwriter-in-chief of The Icicle Works in the 1980s, and his critically-acclaimed solo career throughout from the early 1990s to date. He has also played with musicians as diverse as Ringo Starr, Crazy Horse, Mike Scott (of The Waterboys), and Danny Thompson of folk legends Pentangle.\n\n\n1991ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1997: Quicksilver/This Way Up era\n\nFollowing the split of the Icicle Works in 1990, and the subsequent dissolution of The Wild Swans, McNabb issued two singles in 1991 to little notice. He then resurfaced in 1993 with a collection of demos which would form the basis of his first solo album, Truth and Beauty. Recorded on a shoestring, it won him a record deal with Andrew Lauder's new 'This Way Up' Label.\nThe album's first proper single &quot;If Love Was Like Guitars&quot; became a minor UK hit in 1993. Following this, the 1991 single &quot;Great Dreams of Heaven&quot; was re-released, but failed to gain much airplay, possibly due to lyrical references such as &quot;babies being born H.I.V.&quot;\nThe next single pulled from the album (&quot;I'm Game&quot;) failed to chart, so This Way Up went for a different strategy. &quot;(I Go) My Own Way&quot; was re-recorded with Stone Roses producer John Leckie at the helm, but it too failed to significantly impact on the UK charts. Still, This Way Up stuck with McNabb and vice versa.\nPost-Truth and Beauty, McNabb was allegedly inspired to a rockier sound by the engineer who mastered that record, telling him &quot;Aye, Ian, your rocking days are behind you.&quot; Legend has it that McNabb went back to his home in Liverpool, and recorded a demo of what would become the coruscating opener of Head Like a Rock, &quot;Fire Inside My Soul&quot;.\nLabel boss Andrew Lauder then suggested that McNabb go to record in America, which McNabb was skeptical about. He facetiously suggested to Lauder that his new material sounded like Neil Young and Crazy Horse, and if Lauder could get Crazy Horse to play on the record, he would go to America. A few phone calls later, McNabb found himself in a Los Angeles studio with Crazy Horse drummer Ralph Molina and bassist Billy Talbot. This cast-iron rhythm section appeared on four of the ten tracks on Head Like a Rock, including the #54 UK hit &quot;You Must Be Prepared To Dream&quot;. The album's other single, &quot;Go Into The Light&quot;, did not feature Crazy Horse and peaked at UK #66.\nHead Like a Rock was subsequently nominated for the 1994 Mercury Music Prize, and although M People would end up taking the award home, the attendant publicity surrounding the award-nominated album propelled Head Like A Rock into the UK album charts, where it peaked at #29.\nMolina and Talbot toured with McNabb in 1994, featuring on the short live bonus CD which accompanied his next album, Merseybeast. This performance also featured Noel Gallagher of Oasis on uncredited rhythm guitar as the group covered The Seeds' &quot;Pushin' Too Hard&quot;. Gallagher's refusal to be credited reportedly inspired the later McNabb composition &quot;Don't Patronise Me&quot;, although McNabb has always denied this accusation.\nThe 1996 album Merseybeast saw McNabb with a new backing band called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe AfterlifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. But despite high expectations for the new CD, the album's first single, the fierce &quot;Don't Put Your Spell On Me&quot; only hit UK #72. The second single, the album's title track (which saw McNabb exploring his scouse roots and merging them with West Coast Americana) fared even worse, hitting UK #74.\nAlthough generally well-received by critics and fans, in the end Merseybeast failed to capitalize on the commercial success of its predecessor. This led to a two-year hiatus on McNabbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s part from both touring under his own name, and recording full studio albums.\nIn 1997, This Way Up parted company with McNabb, and released a 'best-of' collection entitled My Own Way: The Words &amp; Music of Ian McNabb.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.
