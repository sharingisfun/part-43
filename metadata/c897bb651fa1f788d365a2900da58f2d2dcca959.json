It is the band's first single since the departure of Ryan Ross and Jon Walker, and is the first single to feature an exclamation point in the band's name since 2007's &quot;Build God, Then We'll Talk&quot;.\n\nAccording to Urie, the song was written two and half years ago after he woke up from a dream and had to write a song about the dream.\n\nThe music video was filmed on July 22, 2009 in Hollywood with director Kai Regan. The video was released on iTunes on August 24th, 2009.\n\nThe video is set in an American high school, with high school students in different cliques such as cheerleaders, goths, etc. The video starts with Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith walking into the school in plain black suits and black sunglasses. They walk past the students, not paying attention even when fighting breaks out around them. The pair continues walking as the fire alarm sounds and the sprinklers activate. They take off their sunglasses and a few seconds later the scene rewinds, returning to the start off the video, and again showing Brendon and Spencer as they enter the school. The next part of the music video is shown in photographs rather than film. The pictures depict the pair getting shouted at by teachers, and being taken towards the front doors only to be attacked by the same students involved in the fight earlier. Brendon and Spencer get pushed and beaten through the hallways and down a staircase to where they are finally shown alone and in film again, limping away from the school, with bruises and damaged clothing. Throughout the music video are Jennifer's Body references, such as shirts that read, &quot;I eat boys&quot; and &quot;Jennifer's Body&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c897bb651fa1f788d365a2900da58f2d2dcca959","amp;dn":"Panic%21+At+The+Disco+-+New+Perspective","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c897bb651fa1f788d365a2900da58f2d2dcca959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,151,187,101,31,161,247,136,211,101,162,144,13,165,143,45,45,204,169,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
