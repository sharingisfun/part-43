Although it sold respectably, it didn't have any major hit singles. Smyth returned to the top of the charts in 1992 with &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,&quot; a duet with Don Henley; the single hit number two and went gold. Its parent album, Patty Smyth, also went gold and featured two other minor hits, &quot;No Mistakes&quot; and &quot;I Should Be Laughing.&quot;  \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\t\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Warrior\n02.Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough (With Don Henley)\n03.Wish I Were You\n04.Carnival Lights\n05.Love's Got A Line On You\n06.Goodbye To You\n07.I Should Be Laughing\n08.Downtown Train\n09.The River Cried\n10.Everyone Gets Older\n11.Say What You Will\n12.Beat Of A Heart\n13.Heartache Heard Round The World\n14.Isn't It Enough\n15.No Mistakes\n16.Hands Tied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                    ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e66ecc5f900e4286bb27a375345741872c42323","amp;dn":"Patty+Smyth+-+Greatest+Hits+%281998%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e66ecc5f900e4286bb27a375345741872c42323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,102,236,197,249,0,228,40,107,178,122,55,83,69,116,24,114,196,35,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
