Please do your part and stop sharing 700mb and dvds ripped to fit on dvd5! This is 2010. People can learn how to shrink their own damn dvds and if you are still on dialup stop being a cheap fucker and get a job! If you dont own a dvd burner thats ridiculous.\n\nMy scifi movie list:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://freetexthost.com/d3kg3o5t1x&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://freetexthost.com/d3kg3o5t1x&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThese are the movies currently in my scifi directory.
