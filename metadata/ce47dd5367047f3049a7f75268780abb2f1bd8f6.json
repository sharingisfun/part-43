The film follows the recovery process of four patients at the world renowned extended care recovery facility JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute  in New Jersey.  It presents an unprecedented in-depth look at the rehabilitation process for more than a year with access to the patients, families, and caretakers.\n\nThe outreach effort is a cooperative process with the Brain Injury Association of America (BIAA) , the nation's leading non-profit advocacy group and information clearing house for traumatic brain injury patients and families. Our primary goal is to support the recovery process of patients and families and the professional development of TBI caregivers through film screenings. We believe that our film provides an honest and accurate case study of the recovery process and will foster constructive dialogue about many issues surrounding recovery. BIAA is also using the film in conjunction with their efforts on Capitol Hill, providing copies to Members of Congress and other decision makers so they can see beyond the statistics and better understand the life changing impact that TBI has on families. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nActors: Tom Segars, Roxanne Guzman, Sean Reilly, Al'Khan Edwards, Joseph Giacino\nDirectors: Liz Garbus\nFormat: Closed-captioned, Color, DVD, NTSC\nLanguage: English\nStudio: Hbo Home Video\nDVD Release Date: January 29, 2008\nRun Time: 102 minutes\nASIN: B000YI99OG\n\nProduct Description\nHBO Documentary Films unique look at the mystery of traumatic brain injury, which has captivated Americas imagination for decades, COMA follows the personal journeys of four traumatic brain injury patients over the year following their emergence from a coma into either a persistent vegetative state, a minimally conscious state, or beyond.

Academy AwardÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-nominated director Liz GarbusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ insightful documentary COMA explores the mysteries of the injured brain and its ability to heal when the exclusive HBO presentation debuts TUESDAY, JULY 3 (9:00-10:45 p.m. ET/PT).  Giving voice to people whose quality of life and very existence have been threatened, the special goes inside a top U.S. medical facility for the treatment of head trauma and follows four coma survivors over the course of a year.\n\nIn the wake of the Terri Schiavo media spectacle and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œawakeningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Terry Wallis from a minimally conscious state after 19 years of silence, Garbus strives to find answers away from the glare of the media.  With unprecedented access to the Center for Head Injuries at the JFK Medical Center in Edison, NJ, she chronicles the emotional stories of four families for one year, looking through the eyes of their renowned physicians and neuropsychologists, led by Dr. Joseph Giacino and Dr. Caroline McCagg. COMA debuts nationwide Tuesday, July 3rd at 9:00p.m., only on HBO!   \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/television/03bell.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/television/03bell.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTelevision Review | 'Coma'\nCoping With Uncertainty After Injury to the Brain\nBy GINIA BELLAFANTE\nPublished: July 3, 2007\n\nThe feel-good movie has its corollary in the universe of cable television in the feel-bad documentary, the exploration of some illness, catastrophe or political horror whose primary purpose is to wrest viewers from their complacency but whose effect, invariably, is to validate their blessed fortune. You watch a documentary about AIDS orphans in Africa and feel compelled to send a check to a charity until you remember you have no stamp to mail the envelope. Your errands are mounting, and by the time youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve finished tallying them, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve moved on, awash in the comforting knowledge that a surfeit of obligations and a limited time frame constitute the full plate of your daily challenges.\n\nTelevision has become such an expansive catalog of suffering that we cannot help but keep the pages turning. But ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComa,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a documentary about severe brain injury to be shown on HBO tonight, is so committed to curiosity over crusade that it functions as a bookmark. Informed by the Terry Schiavo case, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ floats above the ethical debates it inspired. The filmmaker, Liz Garbus, retains a cool control of her camera, deploying a reportorial style that is an object lesson in the virtues of unobstrusiveness.\n\nMs. Garbus follows four patients at the Center for Head Injuries at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, N.J., in the aftermath of devastating accidents (in one instance an assault), never supplying the particulars that would give her project the cast of emotional gruesomeness. No one she profiles, it seems, will fully recover ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ one patient remains in a persistent vegetative state, and his family is told he wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t improve at all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but others emerge from minimally conscious states to struggle with motor, cognitive and auditory skills.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is in a sense a poem to the vastly different ways human beings cope with uncertainty. The uncertainty around severe brain injury, about which doctors still donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know a tremendous amount, seems unusually pervasive. Families of the patients in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œComaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are not besieged with statistics. Numbers and graphs and the solace they can provide are absent here. The prognoses are all vague.\n\nTom, an attractive man in his 30s, canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t speak fluidly or consistently and canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t walk, but his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conviction that he will return to his former self, that they will marry and pursue the life they had planned, remains as unwavering as an alcoholicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s faith in a drink. TomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother takes joy in his small triumphs but breaks down, while his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e, Lynda, remains calmly managerial.\n\nSome family members canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t deal with the pernicious constancy of their loved oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disease. As a mother says of her son, he needs to get better or worse. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as she puts it, referring to his state, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œis unacceptable.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nProduced and directed by Liz Garbus; Rory Kennedy and Jed Rothstein, producers; Daniel B.
