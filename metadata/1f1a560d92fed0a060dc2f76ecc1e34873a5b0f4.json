Werner and Ruth S. Smith\n  Copyright 1982\n\n\n\nComments on the Book:\n    It really is a good study and book. There has been plenty of papers and books written about the study--it was very comprehensive and contains information about the subjects from before birth to adulthood. I warn you that the book involves a lot of statistics and the writing is ok.\n\n\n\nComments on this File:\n    This file contains one pdf. It is a scan of every single page(including some blank ones) of the hard cover version of the book.\n    Unfortunately, this book is out of print.\n\n\n\nBrief Summary of the Book:\n    A longitudinal study conducted on the children born in 1954 on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. There was a correlation between having a certain number of risks--poverty, medical problems, lack of care, etc--and developing serious behavior, mental health, and delinquency problems. There was a subset of children who developed into healthy adults despite having these risks; this book is about these resilient children and looks at these children from before birth to 18 years of age.\n    The book discusses: the setting of the study; methodology; factors leading up to and during pregnancy--biological and social; sex differences associated with resiliency; characteristics of resilient infants &amp; toddlers; family structure; personality of resilient adolescents; sources of support; resilient kids of parents with psychiatric problems; and significant predictive discriminators between resilient and non-resilient kids.\n    Throughout the book, the authors compare resilient children and non-resilient children (children who developed problems).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1a560d92fed0a060dc2f76ecc1e34873a5b0f4","amp;dn":"Werner+-+Vulnerable+But+Invincible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1a560d92fed0a060dc2f76ecc1e34873a5b0f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,26,86,13,146,254,208,160,96,220,47,118,236,193,227,72,115,165,176,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
