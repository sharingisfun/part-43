It consists of material from their MMMBop album minus four tracks. There is much confusion that 3 Car Garage contains tracks from both the MMMBop and Boomerang albums, when actually, only songs from MMMBop are present. The tracks that never made it from MMMBop to 3 Car Garage are the shorter version of &quot;MMMBop&quot;, &quot;Something New&quot;, &quot;Incredible&quot;, and &quot;Baby (You're So Fine)&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb064d5ab674dcdad45d05d032174d76ea8c7cc","amp;dn":"Hanson+-+3+Car+Garage+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb064d5ab674dcdad45d05d032174d76ea8c7cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,176,100,213,171,103,77,205,173,69,208,93,3,33,116,215,110,168,199,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
