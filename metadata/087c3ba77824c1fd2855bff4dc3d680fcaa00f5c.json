Himzo had disappeared in the early 1990s during the height of the ethnic cleansing campaign by Serbian forces. His return was a shock to the senses for everyone. For family it was joy at the return of a son. For neighbours it was a painful reminder of what they had lost and fuelled burning questions about what happened. When answers are not forthcoming - Himzo claims he doesn't remember - intrigue erupts into fury. This film attempts to uncover what happened during those 12 lost years and reveals a community haunted by tragedy.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 54mn 12s 686ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTv\nSpoken Language   : Serbian\nSubtittles        : English\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 066 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 120 Kbps VBR\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087c3ba77824c1fd2855bff4dc3d680fcaa00f5c","amp;dn":"tvo+Human+Edge+-+Dead+Man+Walking+%282005%29+PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087c3ba77824c1fd2855bff4dc3d680fcaa00f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,124,59,167,120,36,193,253,40,85,191,244,220,61,104,15,202,160,15,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
