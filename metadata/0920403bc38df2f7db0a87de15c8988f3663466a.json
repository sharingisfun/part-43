McCartney had released two projects with Youth under the moniker The Fireman. Because McCartney was so heavily involved in its creation, in addition to his production credit, Liverpool Sound Collage, which was released in 2000, is generally considered a part of his main discography and is filed under his name.\n\nAsked by artist Peter Blake to create something musical and with a Liverpool spirit to it, in order to complement his concurrent artwork exhibition, McCartney ended up harking all the way back to session chatter by The Beatles (hence their &quot;involvement&quot;) and using snippets of his 1991 classical piece Paul McCartney's Liverpool Oratorio. He also can be heard walking the streets and asking various paedestrians to give their impressions of Liverpool and The Beatles.\n\nLiverpool Sound Collage was nominated for the 2001 Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\nRipped at 128.\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Plastic Beetle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:23 \nPaul McCartney, The Beatles \n\n&quot;Peter Blake 2000&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 16:54 \nSuper Furry Animals, The Beatles \n\n&quot;Real Gone Dub Made In Manifest In The Vortex Of The Eternal Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 16:37 \nYouth \n\n&quot;Made Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 12:58 \nPaul McCartney, The Beatles \n\n&quot;Free Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29 \nPaul McCartney, The Beatles, Super Furry Animals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0920403bc38df2f7db0a87de15c8988f3663466a","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+Liverpool+Sound+Collage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0920403bc38df2f7db0a87de15c8988f3663466a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,32,64,59,195,141,242,247,219,10,135,222,21,200,152,143,54,99,70,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
