Living in complete fear of the state, the refugees claim they are being rounded up and subjected to bloody whippings and indefinite imprisonment in overcrowded detention camps. For some this is just the beginning of a horrific journey into the trafficking network, where men, women and children disappear into a world of slavery and prostitution.\n\nMalaysia pays no regard to Burmese refugees' right of asylum, since the country refuses to sign up to international conventions. And it's not just the state that acts harshly. Hartley and Waldrum join a night-time city raid by volunteers of the RELA militia to chase down and arrest construction site workers without valid papers.\n\n Millions of illegal migrants, many of whom are refugees, fill the building sites and factories, providing cheap labour and doing the jobs Malaysians don't want to do. Despite this, RELA, which has 500,000 members, claims to be cleaning up what they see as an immigrant threat to law, order and health.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2009/episode-19&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.channel4.com/programmes/unreported-world/episode-guide/series-2009/episode-19&lt;/a&gt; Edits \n\n\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=100067\nCap:  geclipse\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2194f8ba4fbcda90dbb6b4b2a6fee80383092836","amp;dn":"Unreported+World+%7EMalaysia%3A+Refugees+for+Sale++2009+11+20++Ch.+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2194f8ba4fbcda90dbb6b4b2a6fee80383092836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,148,248,186,79,188,218,144,219,182,180,178,166,254,232,3,131,9,40,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
