Still, people in the USA can watch that movie from afar in a way, thinking all throughout that animal cruelty is something which happens \\\\\\&quot;over there\\\\\\&quot; and not in close proximity to the comforts and norms of our own day to day lives.\n\nWhat Bold Native does is to make the issue of animal cruelty immediate and engaging, by offering us a narrative about characters that are relatable and likable, in a story line that is believable, while at the same time showing throughout genuine footage of actual animal barbarism that isn\\\\\\'t an overbearing onslaught like a propaganda video. Instead this intense footage is used sparingly and tastefully amidst the narrative, shocking to those who might be unaware of what is truly going on behind the food and clothing industries, and horrifying enough to hammer home the point that animal cruelty is happening all around us, everyday. The film poses a challenge to us: that if what we see is abhorrent and if we feel compelled to respond, that it is up to us to engage the issue directly, in whatever capacity we deem appropriate.\n\nThis is an undeniably challenging film.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7ad58d6f5064d05436be5ecc94774802c6e58f","amp;dn":"Bold+Native","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f7ad58d6f5064d05436be5ecc94774802c6e58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,122,213,141,111,80,100,208,84,54,190,94,204,148,119,72,2,198,229,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
