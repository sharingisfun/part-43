From the great mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, who did much to establish the mathematical tradition we now know as algebra, to Ibn Sina, a pioneer of early medicine whose Canon of Medicine was still in use as recently as the 19th century, he pieces together a remarkable story of the often-overlooked achievements of the early medieval Islamic scientists.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82ea7aa87cabbbf8034bc263dd7ff688f5108082","amp;dn":"Science+and+Islam++%28BBC+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82ea7aa87cabbbf8034bc263dd7ff688f5108082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,234,122,168,124,171,187,248,3,75,194,99,221,127,246,136,245,16,128,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
