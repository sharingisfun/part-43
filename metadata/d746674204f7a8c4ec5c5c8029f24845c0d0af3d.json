Sylvian and Karn teamed with keyboardist Richard Barbieri and Steve Jansen, adding guitarists Phil Palmer and Bill Nelson for their self-titled debut. Like a mellower, new age-oriented version of Japan, Rain Tree Crow explores stark soundscapes that sound alternately beautiful and desolate. Although it is a bit too challenging to provide a good introduction to Sylvian and Karn's music, the album remains fascinating for their fans.&quot; \n\nWikipedia bio:\n\nRain Tree Crow was the name used by the successful English New Wave band Japan (excluding Rob Dean) when they briefly reformed for this one-off project, which would be their final album. It was the first time all four members of the band, David Sylvian, Steve Jansen, Mick Karn and Richard Barbieri, collaborated on a project since the compilation of the 1983 live album Oil on Canvas.\nThe majority of the material on their eponymous album was written as a result of group improvisations (aside from 'Blackwater'). There were no pre-rehearsals and the music that emerged was a hybrid of atmospheric ambient ballads in the style of lead singer David Sylvian's contemporaneous albums and more dissonant experimental styles that sometimes echoed the work of Tom Waits and King Crimson. The album was mostly recorded at Miravel Studios, France, between September 1989 and April 1990.\nAll members of the band aside from Sylvian wished to retain the Japan moniker which was last used when the band split in December 1982. However, Sylvian levered increasing artistic and production control over the project (including his insistence on using the RTC name, much to the other member's bemusement and annoyance), to the point where the recording developed from a band effort into a what was essentially another Sylvian solo project, leaving the other members as mere sessioners for the front man. As a consequence Jansen, Barbieri and Karn did not promote the &quot;Rain Tree Crow&quot; album. A scheduled follow-up album and a Japan reunion tour were both cancelled. In 2006 David Sylvian himself confirmed in a candid interview with The Guardian that he and his brother Steve Jansen in fact did not speak to each other for five years after the Rain Tree Crow project was completed.\nBlackwater was released as the album's only cut and just missed the Top 60 in the UK singles charts in March 1991. The album itself was, in general, critically acclaimed by the music press and reached the Top 25 in the UK albums chart.\n\n&quot;...the album is at its best. Rain Tree Crow is not ponderous, as Japan once had pretensions to be, but it fills a darkened room nicely.&quot; -- Sue Peter, Option, 92&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nRain Tree Crow (1991)\n=====================\n\n01. &quot;Big Wheels in Shanty Town&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:08 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, hammond organ, electric piano, shortwave radio, horn arrangement \nBill Nelson - electric guitar \nMick Karn - bass, brass, horn arrangement \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nDjene Doumbouya - vocal \nDjanka Djabate - vocal \nSteve Jansen - drums, percussion, hammond organ \n\n02. &quot;Every Colour You Are&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, electric piano, shortwave radio, treatments \nPhil Palmer - slide guitar \nMick Karn - bass, saxophone \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - drums, percussion\n \n03. &quot;Rain Tree Crow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, percussion \nMick Karn - pipes \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - percussion \n\n04. &quot;Red Earth (As Summertime Ends)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:38 \nDavid Sylvian - slide guitar, keyboards, Indian drum \nPhil Palmer - acoustic guitar \nMichael Brook - bass conga \nMick Karn - bass, tabla \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nBrian Gascoigne - orchestration \nSteve Jansen - ceramic drums, percussion \n\n05. &quot;Pocket Full of Change&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:08 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, organ \nMichael Brook - guitar treatments \nMick Karn - bass, brass \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - drums, percussion, organ \n\n06. &quot;Boat's for Burning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:45 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - tambourine\n \n07. &quot;New Moon at Deer Wallow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12 \nDavid Sylvian - electric guitar, bass \nMick Karn - bass clarinet \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - Moroccan clay drum, fan drums\n \n08. &quot;Blackwater&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, keyboards \nBill Nelson - electric guitar \nMick Karn - bass \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - drums, percussion\n \n09. &quot;A Reassuringly Dull Sunday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:22 \nDavid Sylvian - organ, keyboards, percussion \nMichael Brook - percussion \nMick Karn - bass clarinet, percussion \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer, piano \nSteve Jansen - marimba, percussion\n \n10. &quot;Blackcrow Hits Shoe Shine City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, organ, electric piano, keyboards, treatments \nMick Karn - bass, saxophone \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - drums, percussion\n \n11. &quot;Scratchings on the Bible Belt&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46 \nDavid Sylvian - electric guitar, banjo, marimba, harmonium \nMichael Brook - treatments \nMick Karn - bass clarinet \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer, water wheel \nSteve Jansen - piano, marimba, percussion \n\n12. &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31 \nDavid Sylvian - vocal, electric guitar, treatments \nMick Karn - bass \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizer \nSteve Jansen - percussion \n\n13. &quot;I Drink to Forget&quot; - 1:46 \nDavid Sylvian - piano, keyboards, percussion \nMick Karn - wine glasses \nRichard Barbieri - synthesizers \nSteve Jansen - wine glasses, percussion \n\n\nEnjoy and - most importantly - share with your fellow man.
