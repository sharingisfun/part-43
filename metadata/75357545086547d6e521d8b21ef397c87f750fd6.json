Sonny then finds out that giving the dog affection\n      effects  Gassie's  mood  to  flatulate  on  command  when filming the\n      &quot;Gassie&quot;  sketches  as  well  jeopardizing the feature film &quot;Gassie &amp;\n      We&quot;. Sonny then gives Gassie too many dog treats that may have killed\n      him.  In  the  end  it  turns  out  Gassie was in shock from too many\n      meatball treats and gets the love he deserves, also putting Chad into\n      shock  by  pretending  to  be  dead. Meanwhile, Nico and Grady borrow\n      money  from  Dakota  Condor  to  invest in fart noise lunch boxes for\n      &quot;Gassie &amp; We&quot;.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t         Additional Info\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n      So Random! sketch:\n\n\t    &quot;Gassie the Toot'n Pooch&quot;\n\n      Guest Star: Genevieve Hannelius as Dakota Condor \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      For Frequently Asked Questions please read the included FAQ README.\n      \n      Any  show  that I decide to cap by request I will not keep either the\n      source  or  the  converted  file.
