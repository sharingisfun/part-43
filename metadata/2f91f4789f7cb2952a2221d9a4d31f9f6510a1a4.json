Astray, the Berkeley, CA, band's sixth album, is vintage Samiam: staccato guitars that suddenly burst, emotional lyrics, and a tight, indie punk sound. Once again, the band continued to push the boundaries of melodic hardcore with Astray. Highlights include &quot;Super Brava,&quot; &quot;Calloused,&quot; and &quot;Dull,&quot; the last a flowing song long enough to have different movements. A telling line: &quot;I've had a lot of time to think, and I'm so tired of thinking/I know why he put that bullet in his skull/because life can be so dull.&quot; While the band's name is borrowed from Dr. Seuss, the music is more sophisticated than children's books, as well as most punk rock. \n\nFormat: CD\nLabel: Hopeless Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie, Punk Revival\nQuality: FLAC\n\nTracks:\n\n   1.
