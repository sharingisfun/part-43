These songs were huge singles for the band but don't expect any hits off Up!\nThe first post Bill Berry album finds the (now) trio in an experimental mood. From the first hypnotic synthesizer tones of Airportman to the subdued ballad closer Falls to Climb, Up is a maudlin, slow paced effort. It also contains some of the most ambitious music this amazing band has made to date.\n\nOnly Daysleeper (the already failed single) and Lotus recall earlier work by the band. The driving Bill Berry beat has been replaced by drum machines and occasional real drums. Outstanding tracks include the Beach Boys tribute &quot;At my most beautiful&quot;, the driving Hope (to the tune of Leonard Cohen's Susanne) and the almost positive &quot;Walk Unafraid&quot;.\n\nOne final warning. Unless you are prepared to sit down and spend some time absorbing this album, don't expect it to grab you by the neck like Out of Time. However if you do love this band and appreciate their past uncommercial efforts, you will find a cornocopia of amazing music on Up. \n\nby A Costumer\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Airportman.wma                                              \n02 - Lotus.wma                                                   \n03 - Suspicion.wma                                               \n04 - Hope.wma                                                    \n05 - At My Most Beautiful.wma                                    \n06 - The Apologist.wma                                           \n07 - Sad Professor.wma                                           \n08 - You're In The Air.wma                                       \n09 - Walk Unafraid.wma                                           \n10 - Why Not Smile.wma                                           \n11 - Daysleeper.wma                                              \n12 - Diminished.wma                                              \n13 - Parakeet.wma                                                \n14 - Falls To Climb.wma     \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nDEDICATED TO azza1969","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7cf47af63c4282bf2ac92ba8f4497abb9d634e1","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Up+%281998%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7cf47af63c4282bf2ac92ba8f4497abb9d634e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,207,71,175,99,196,40,43,242,172,146,186,143,68,151,171,185,214,52,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
