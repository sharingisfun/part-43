YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear the sweat and blood of the live performance, and all the scratchy bits!&quot;.\n\nWith all B&amp;W Music Club albums, we try and bring you something different and very special and would love to know what you think of it.\n-- blog.bowers-wilkins.com\n\nTracks\n01 - Kele Kele\n02 - Tonio Yima\n03 - Achoo\n04 - Fulani Choochie Man\n05 - Gainako\n06 - Reme Reme\n07 - Gnawa\n08 - Fouta Jalo\n\nArtwork included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9011390f99d96ece51a4f69756d3762d770de86","amp;dn":"Justin+Adams%2C+Juldeh+Camara+-+The+Afrobilly+Sessions+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9011390f99d96ece51a4f69756d3762d770de86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,1,19,144,249,157,150,236,229,26,79,105,117,109,55,98,215,112,222,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
