And, as always from me, 100% complete ID3's and 500x500 art.\n\nTorrent contains the three studio releases (so Far), 4th is slated for who knows when.\n\n1. I (Yellow)\n2. II (Green)\n3. III (Red)\n\n4. (Green) Bonus Disc\n\n5. The Down Town [Single]\n\n6. B-Sides*\n\n*Note, I think the B-sides is an unofficial compilation, they pretty much all appeared on some release or another, mostly soundtracks. Plus 1 live performance of &quot;Freak&quot; at some acoustic show before he created Days Of The New.\n\nEnjoy!\nHMD3\n\nAnd please help seed, torrentas in general are lacking a good strong, high quality DOTN torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81c37b0e55f4bf2d7cc80da558595be91f38350","amp;dn":"Days+Of+The+New+%5B320kbps%5D%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81c37b0e55f4bf2d7cc80da558595be91f38350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,28,55,176,229,95,75,242,215,204,128,218,85,133,149,190,145,243,131,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
