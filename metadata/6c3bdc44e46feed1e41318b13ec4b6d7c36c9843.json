As Rock Daily previously reported, Hayley Williams and Co. worked with American Idiot producer Rob Cavallo on the new disc. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe made a record that is exactly what we set out to make,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Williams said of the follow-up to their smash Riot! on the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s LiveJournal page back in April. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fast, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s slow, and in betweenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ happy, angry, desperate and over it. And I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cover art, featuring a dismembered butterfly, is also posted on the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official site.\n\n    First single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIgnoranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is out July 7th, but those Web-savvy Paramore fans have already found a 30-second preview of the track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cover art ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ over at Amazon.com. July 7th is also the first day fans can begin pre-ordering the album and get the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIgnoranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ringtone.\n\n    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIgnoranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a fitting title for the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first single, as Williams told Rolling Stone in December, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have a lot to say this time around, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot of things I thought I knew that I was absolutely wrong about.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So, after pleading ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIgnorance,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Williams is now seeing everything with Brand New Eyes. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3bdc44e46feed1e41318b13ec4b6d7c36c9843","amp;dn":"Paramore+-+Brand+New+Eyes+%282009%29+%5BLossless%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3bdc44e46feed1e41318b13ec4b6d7c36c9843","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,59,220,68,228,111,238,209,228,19,24,177,62,196,182,215,195,108,152,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
