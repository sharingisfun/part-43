British Rapper Mike Skinner Captures The Simple Details Of A Simple Existence That Inhabits The Lower Levels Of The Middle Class. But Whereas Original Pirate Material Was More About Everyday Life On The Streets, This Follow-Up Is More About Everyday Life In The Flat--Mom's Kitchen, My Mate's Living Room, My Girl's Couch. The Streets Has Fallen In Love, And His Raps Narrate The Adventures And Misadventures Of This Romance. In All, It Is A Concept Album That Places Greater Emphasis On Storytelling Rather Than On The Music, Which Is Often Spare With Little Or No Enhancements. With Some Songs Expressing The Beauty Of Love And Others Expressing The Pleasures Of Drugs, The Streets Is Still Holding It Down For The UK.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] It Was Supposed To Be So Easy\n[02] Could Well Be In\n[03] Not Addicted\n[04] Blinded By The Lights\n[05] Wouldn't Have It Any Other Way\n[06] Get Out Of My House\n[07] Fit But You Know It\n[08] Such A Twat\n[09] What Is He Thinking?\n[10] Dry Your Eyes\n[11] Empty Cans\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:50m:36s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 124mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v2.2 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Electronica Dance Hip Hop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 18 May 2004\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Pure Groove Music Universal Music\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.the-streets.co.uk \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.skinnermike.com/ \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/The+Streets \n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/thestreets \n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc8b51eaac931bb2d28e7d5e86d4883ecbd0b74","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+A+Grand+Dont+Come+For+Free+-+The+Streets+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc8b51eaac931bb2d28e7d5e86d4883ecbd0b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,200,181,30,170,201,49,187,45,40,231,213,232,109,72,131,236,189,11,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
