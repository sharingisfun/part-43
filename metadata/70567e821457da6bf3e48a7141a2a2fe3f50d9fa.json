His subjects range from traffic wardens to estate agents, with Tom recalling his own funny and ridiculous experiences as well as recounting the absurd encounters of others. \n\nIt's a show about being proud and sticking up for what is right.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/tom_wrigglesworth_open_letter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/tom_wrigglesworth_open_letter/&lt;/a&gt; Review: \n\nWith a down-to-earth charm and an insightful eye for the idiosyncrasies of British life, Tom is one of the country's leading young stand-up comedians and this is a great programme vehicle for him.\n\nWrigglesworth's original routine, based on the true story of what happened on a Manchester to London train on 9th October 2008, stormed Edinburgh... so it's great Radio 4 brought it to a wider audience in the 2010 pilot.\n\nThe full series is just as fun, with some clever use of the English language, although perhaps some of the targets are a little easy (yes, we all dislike parking wardens) \n\n\nCast: \nTom Wrigglesworth\nJoanna Monro\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters - S01 - E01 - Parking Enforcement\nTom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters - S01 - E02 - Utilities Companies\nTom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters - S01 - E03 - Bankers \nTom Wrigglesworth's Open Letters - S01 - E04 - Estate Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3 \nDuration Approx : 25mn 54s \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70567e821457da6bf3e48a7141a2a2fe3f50d9fa","amp;dn":"Tom+Wrigglesworth%5C%27s+Open+Letters+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70567e821457da6bf3e48a7141a2a2fe3f50d9fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,86,126,130,20,87,218,107,243,228,138,113,65,162,162,254,63,80,217,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
