And it was into this caustic tabloid climate that she released her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw). Though the album was critically panned, it was certified gold early in 2006. Later that year, Lohan was switched from Casablanca to Motown Records by Universal Music Group. Though she focused more on her film career in 2006 and 2007 and continued to have a swirl of tabloid attention and media controversy around her -- including her arrest on May 26, 2007, for suspicion of driving under the influence and a subsequent stay at Malibu, CA's Promises Treatment Center -- Lohan planned work on a third album in the second half of 2007.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n\n01.Confessions Of A Broken Heart (Daughter To Father)\n02.Black Hole\n03.I Live For The Day\n04.I Want You To Want Me\n05.My Innocence\n06.A Little More Personal\n07.If It's Alright\n08.If You Were Me\n09.Fastlane\n10.Edge Of Seventeen\n11.Who Loves You\n12.A Beautiful Life (La Bella Vita)\n\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed5089c529c7bcd0f86877f0c6e5434240b3d93c","amp;dn":"Lindsay+Lohan+-+A+Little+More+Personal+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed5089c529c7bcd0f86877f0c6e5434240b3d93c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,80,137,197,41,199,188,208,248,104,119,240,198,229,67,66,64,179,217,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
