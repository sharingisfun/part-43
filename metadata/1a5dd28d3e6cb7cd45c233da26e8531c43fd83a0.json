These people have slow download and it helps them a lot (please, be generous - on such file having ratio 11.7:1 is like 1:1 on normal-sized XviD).. \nThank you.\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCompatible brands: JVT AVC\nNumber of streams: 2\nVideo Codec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nDisplay aspect ratio: 341:192 = 1.776041 (~16:9)\nBitrate: 168 kbps\nAudio Codec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 16.110460 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 11025 Hz\n\n*******************************************************************\n\nNOTE: 272p comes after, choose version you need.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5dd28d3e6cb7cd45c233da26e8531c43fd83a0","amp;dn":"Breaking.Bad.S03E04.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a5dd28d3e6cb7cd45c233da26e8531c43fd83a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,93,210,141,62,108,183,205,69,194,51,218,38,232,83,28,67,253,131,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
