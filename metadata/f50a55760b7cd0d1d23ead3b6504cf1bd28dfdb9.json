This \nrehearsal took place at Mike Leonard\\\\\\'s house and was recorded by Irene Winsby.\n\n4 - Arnold Layne (Barrett) (Acetate) - 02:34\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967\nPrimary source: EMIdisc acetate\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Anthology II\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nFades in 2 seconds after the actual start, strange edit skipping organ solo.\n\n5 - Arnold Layne (Barrett) (Mono, Single Version) - 02:53\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;Arnold Layne\\\\\\&quot; single (1st single), released March 11, 1967\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\\\\\&quot; CD\n\n6 - Arnold Layne (Barrett) (Fake Stereo) - 02:51\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;The Best of the Pink Floyd\\\\\\&quot; compilation, released 1970\n&amp; \\\\\\&quot;Masters of Rock\\\\\\&quot; compilation, released 1973\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Works\\\\\\&quot; CD\n\n7 - Candy And A Currant Bun (Barrett) (Acetate) - 01:59\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967\nPrimary source: EMIdisc acetate\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Anthology II\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nAlternate lyrics (\\\\\\&quot;please just walk with me\\\\\\&quot; while on the regular single version it\\\\\\'s \\\\\\&quot;please \njust f*** with me\\\\\\&quot;), different verse structure, no organ and guitar solos.\nSome people refer to this version as being \\\\\\&quot;Let\\\\\\'s Roll Another One\\\\\\&quot; from October 1966 sessions at \nThompson Recording Studios, but since the instrumental tracks are the same as the regular single \nversion, this probably comes from the same January 1967 sessions at Sound Techniques Studios.\n\n8 - Candy And A Currant Bun (Barrett) (Mono, Single Version) - 02:43\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, January 23-25, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;Arnold Layne\\\\\\&quot; single (1st single), released March 11, 1967\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\\\\\&quot; CD\nOn the \\\\\\&quot;Masters of Rock\\\\\\&quot; compilation released 1973, there was a mistake in the title: \n\\\\\\&quot;Candy and a Current Bun\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n9 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Demo Version) - 06:57\nRecorded: ?\nPrimary source: ?\nSource for the tree: unknown gen copy\nThis obscure demo is probably a fake. However, it has acquired a certain fame in the \ntrading circle of Pink Floyd fans. We included it here, in order to let you make your own \nopinion. Some say it was recorded on a cheap cassette recorder, by two guys playing \nguitar simultaneously, sometime during the 80s. Note that the first riff after the intro is \nidentical to the bass riff that can be heard on the \\\\\\&quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; version, \nand that earlier versions of the song (on \\\\\\&quot;San Francisco\\\\\\&quot; soundtrack or \\\\\\&quot;Tonite Let\\\\\\'s All \nMake Love in London\\\\\\&quot; soundtrack) don\\\\\\'t contain this particular riff. This leads to the \nconclusion that this \\\\\\&quot;demo\\\\\\&quot; was probably recorded after the release of \\\\\\&quot;The Piper At The \nGates Of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; album.\n\n10 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (CBC Version) - 10:43\nRecorded: London, early January 1967\nPrimary source: CBC Canadian Radio broadcast, early 1967\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Stone Rust\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD &amp; \\\\\\&quot;Dark Globe\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\n&amp; \\\\\\&quot;The Sights And Sounds Of Syd Barrett\\\\\\'s Pink Floyd\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nThis obscure studio version of \\\\\\&quot;Interstellar Overdrive\\\\\\&quot; was used during an interview \nbroadcast in early 1967 by CBC Canadian Radio.\n\n11 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Abbey Road Outtake) - 00:40\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 14-15, 1967\nPrimary source: Capital Radio broadcast (\\\\\\&quot;Pink Floyd Story\\\\\\&quot;), December 1976 - January 1977\nSource for the tree: unknown gen from Capital Radio broadcast\nOuttake from \\\\\\&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; sessions.\n\n12 - Interstellar Overdrive (Barrett, Waters, Wright, Mason) (Mono, Single Version) - 05:13\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 14-15, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;Arnold Layne\\\\\\&quot; French EP, released 1967\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Anthology II\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nThis version is unique, because it only contains the basic track, without overdubs. It \nfades out before the actual end of the song.\n\n13 - Scarecrow (Barrett) (Abbey Road Outtake) - 01:05\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, March 19-20, 1967\nPrimary source: Capital Radio broadcast (\\\\\\&quot;Pink Floyd Story\\\\\\&quot;), December 1976 - January 1977\nSource for the tree: unknown gen from Capital Radio broadcast\nOuttake from \\\\\\&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; sessions.

It includes an interview with \nFloyd\\\\\\'s manager Peter Jenner.\n\n16 - See Emily Play (Barrett) (Actetate) - 02:49\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, May 18 &amp; 21, 1967\nPrimary source: EMIdisc acetate\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Dawn Of The Piper\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nThis version is very close to the regular one, there are only slight changes in the mix \n(vocals are undermixed, organ is more in the front...) and the very end is uncut.\n\n17 - See Emily Play (Barrett) (Mono, Single Version) - 02:52\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, May 18 &amp; 21, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;See Emily Play\\\\\\&quot; single (2nd single), released June 16, 1967\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;The Pink Floyd Early Singles\\\\\\&quot; CD\n\n18 - See Emily Play (Barrett) (Fake Stereo) - 02:49\nRecorded: London, Sound Techniques Studios, May 18 &amp; 21, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;The Best of the Pink Floyd\\\\\\&quot; compilation, released 1970\n&amp; \\\\\\&quot;Masters of Rock\\\\\\&quot; compilation, released 1973\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;A CD Full of Secrets\\\\\\&quot; CD\n\n19 - Flaming (Barrett) (Mono) - 02:43\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, June 7 &amp; 27, 1967\nPrimary source: \\\\\\&quot;Flaming\\\\\\&quot; US single (3rd US single), released November 2, 1967.\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;A CD Full of Secrets\\\\\\&quot; CD\n\\\\\\&quot;Flaming\\\\\\&quot; was not on the first US release of \\\\\\&quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; album, and \nwas then released as a single. This version is different from the regular (stereo) mix: \nbackground noises are mixed much louder.\nIn fact, this version is identical to the version on the mono edition of \\\\\\&quot;The Piper at the Gates of \nDawn\\\\\\&quot; album. Curiously, on the 30th Anniversary Mono Edition CD released in 1997, one chord of \nthe final chords sequence was edited out.\n\n20 - Matilda Mother (Barrett, Belloc) (Alternative Version) - 03:58\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967\nPrimary source: ?\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;An Introduction To Syd Barrett\\\\\\&quot; compilation\nThe original version of the song that was to be released on \\\\\\&quot;The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\\\\\&quot;. Parts\nof the lyrics are taken from the Hilaire Belloc stories, \\\\\\&quot;Cautionary Tales\\\\\\&quot;. But before releasing\nthe song, the Belloc estate denied use of the lyrics. It was later released on the Barrett\ncompilation, \\\\\\&quot;An Introduction To Syd Barrett\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n21 - Untitled (uncredited) - 01:31\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967\nPrimary source: ?\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Dawn Of The Piper\\\\\\&quot; RoIO CD\nThis untitled outtake was probably recorded around the same time \\\\\\&quot;Jugband Blues\\\\\\&quot; and \n\\\\\\&quot;Vegetable Man\\\\\\&quot; were recorded. \nOn a lot of circulating copies, the title of this outtake is \\\\\\&quot;Sunshine\\\\\\&quot;, but it\\\\\\'s wrong (\\\\\\&quot;Sunshine\\\\\\&quot; was \na working title for something that was later included in \\\\\\&quot;Matilda Mother\\\\\\&quot;, and no outtake ever \nsurfaced for this track). On some other copies, the title of this outtake is \\\\\\&quot;Experiment\\\\\\&quot;.\n\n22 - Silas Lang (Barrett) - 02:39\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, 1967 or 1968\nPrimary source: ?\nSource for the tree: \\\\\\&quot;Vegetable Man, Where Are You\\\\\\&quot; RoIO LP\nThere\\\\\\'s a strong debate about the exact origin of this obscure outtake. Some think it was\nrecorded by the Floyd during the \\\\\\&quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\\\\\&quot; sessions, in June 1967. \nOther think it comes from a solo Barrett session in May 1968. This outtake contains the \nearly chords of Syd Barrett\\\\\\'s song \\\\\\&quot;Swan Lee (Silas Lang)\\\\\\&quot;. Note that the piano and jazz \ntunes may be due to a technical error while dubbing the original multitrack master tape \nonto cassette.\n\n-&gt;CD2\n\n1 - Scream Thy Last Scream (Barrett) (Mono) - 04:27\nRecorded: London, Abbey Road Studios, August 7-8, 1967\nPrimary source: EMIdisc acetate\nSource for the tree: unknown gen copy\nThis was intended to be the A-side of Pink Floyd\\\\\\'s fourth single (after \\\\\\&quot;Apples and \nOranges\\\\\\&quot; single).
