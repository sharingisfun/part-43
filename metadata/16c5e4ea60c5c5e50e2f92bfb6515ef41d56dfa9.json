This unique comedic audio release takes fans behind the curtain to explain how he turned a tired, vaudevillian art form into something truly modern and hip. Not only will Jeff reveal how he developed his act and lovable characters over the years, he'll also share details of his life as a working comedian and family man on the road. Best of all, Jeff's hilarious suitcase posse Walter, Peanut, and Achmed!-will personally add their humorous perspectives, jokes, and quips along the way!\n\n\nNOTE: This is my first torrent. I ripped the discs into Windows Media Player and then just uploaded it that way. They're WMA files, but I do not own a converter to convert to .mp4, and am sorry for it. \n\nI will seed for the next few hours or so. Hoping I did this right!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c5e4ea60c5c5e50e2f92bfb6515ef41d56dfa9","amp;dn":"Jeff+Dunham%3A+All+By+My+Selves.+Walter%2C+Peanut%2C+Achmed%2C+and+Me+%28A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c5e4ea60c5c5e50e2f92bfb6515ef41d56dfa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,197,228,234,96,197,197,229,14,47,146,191,182,81,94,244,29,86,223,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
