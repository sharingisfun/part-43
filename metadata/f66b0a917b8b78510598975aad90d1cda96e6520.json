International\nexperts provide the essential elements of each subject, from the fundamentals,\ngeoscience, and structural aspects to the social and economic impact of earthquakes. The\nEarthquake Engineering Handbook emphasizes professional applications, offers ready-to-use\nmaterial that gives immediate answers to real problems, and covers both the traditional and\nthe innovative practices of earthquake engineering.?\n\n- Offers an historical perspective, an overview of the framework for\nearthquake risk management, and an introduction to dynamics\n- Covers geoscience topics, including geology, tectonics, liquefaction, and\ntsunamics, with emphasis on strong ground motion\n- Addresses the range of structures, from building to bridges to the\ninfrastructure of power, transportation and communications systems\n- Stresses professional applications and ready-to-use materials\n- Includes 1,000 illustrations\n\n- - - - -\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nPART 1: FUNDAMENTALS\nEarthquakes-Historical Perspective, Charles Scawthorn\nEarthquake Risk Management-An Overview, Charles Scawthorn\nDynamics of Structures, Jorma K.
