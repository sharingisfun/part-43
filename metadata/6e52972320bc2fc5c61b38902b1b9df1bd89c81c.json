The band has since gone on to release two full length records and has toured with Mogwai, Kylesa, Isis, Jesu, Boris, Pelican, Harvey Milk .\n\nIn early 2007, TorcheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œS/TÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ CD/LP was remastered and re-issued with a bonus track in the states by Robotic Empire and in Europe by Rock Action (MogwaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s respective label). In 2007 they also released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn ReturnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ CDEP/10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on Robotic Empire. The bands new full length, entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMeanderthalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is out now on Hydrahead Records.\n\nThis tape is released by Ricky from Torche's tape label RCP, exclusively distributed by Hydrahead. \n\nBefore TORCHE were recording their masterpiece of an album, Meanderthal, they were completely unorganized and quickly trying to scramble for material to put the album together. This recording, engineered by Torche's own Jonathan Nunez, documents the band pre-Meanderthal showcasing seven rougher, rawer, heavier and slightly different versions of tracks later recorded at God City with Kurt Ballou. An essential for any serious Torche fan... and the unserious ones too.&quot;\n\n\nCurrent line-up \nSteve Brooks - Guitar, Vocals (Floor)\nJon Nunez - Bass (Shitstorm, Adore Miridia)\nRick Smith - Drums (At a Distance, Tyranny of Shaw, Tunes for Bears to Dance to, Ulna, Adore Miridia, Shitstorm, Mehkago N.T.) \n\nPre-Meanderthal studio demo's, never heard by the public... til now.\nAlternate versions of songs like 'Healer', 'Grenades' and 'Across The Shields'\nare quite different on here from those that ended up on the full length. \n\nGenre = Stoner / Sludge Metal\nFormat = mp3\nBit Rate = vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n1. Triumph Of Venus  \n2. Grenades   \n3. Pirhana   \n4. Speed of the Nail  \n5. Sandstorm \n6. Healer   \n7.
