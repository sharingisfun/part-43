It is mostly an English translation of various fragments of Leonardo da Vinci's journals.  Only 303 copies of this book were printed, so I thought it best to buy and scan in one of them.\n\nThe torrent consists of a single .zip file containing over two hundred uncompressed TIFF images.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to convert them into text, even with OCR software.\n\nAs far as I know, this book is in the public domain.\n\nUPDATE: You can now download the plain text version of this book from http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/29904\n\nShare and enjoy!\nZoe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c5d6d66279b1e877fa358d038246148b746b2e6","amp;dn":"Leonardo+da+Vinci%3A+Thoughts+on+Art+and+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c5d6d66279b1e877fa358d038246148b746b2e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,93,109,102,39,155,30,135,127,163,88,208,56,36,97,72,183,70,178,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
