The film grapples with the sad truths of getting older and losing loved ones, all the while maintaining a sardonic wit and sincere warmth. Coming of age in a family-run rest home, the reclusive, death-obsessed Edward (Bill Milner, SON OF RAMBOW) wiles away his days tormenting his parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ elderly residents and secretly tape-recording them in search of answers about the afterlife. Edward finds a kindred spirit in Clarence (Michael Caine), the curmudgeonly, retired magician who begrudgingly takes up residence at the guest home. The two strike up an unlikely friendship that helps Clarence come to terms with losing his wife, and Edward finds a way out of his shell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c9a597915d38df78c431f2a5d45f74d94d9d46","amp;dn":"Is.Anybody.There.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-ALLiANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c9a597915d38df78c431f2a5d45f74d94d9d46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,201,165,151,145,93,56,223,120,196,49,242,165,212,95,116,217,77,157,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
