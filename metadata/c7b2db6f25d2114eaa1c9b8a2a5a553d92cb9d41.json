Michel, Thomas Koenig, Daniel Brandeis, Lorena R. R. Gianotti, Jiri Wackermann, &quot;Electrical Neuroimaging&quot;\nCambridge University Press | 2009 | ISBN: 0521879795 | 248 pages | PDF \n\nElectrical neuroimaging is based on the analysis of brain electrical activity recorded from the human scalp with multichannel EEG. It offers enormous potential for the dynamic mapping of brain functions, and for the non-invasive diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This authoritative reference gives a systematic overview of new electrical imaging methods, with a sound introduction to the basics of multichannel recording of EEG and event-related potential (ERP) data, as well as spatio-temporal analysis of the potential fields. The book enables researchers to measure valid data, select and apply appropriate analysis strategies, and avoid the most common mistakes when analyzing and interpreting EEG/ERP data. Importantly, it informs the research communities of the possibilities opened by these space-domain oriented approaches to the analysis of brain electrical activity, and of their potential to offer even more powerful diagnostic techniques when integrated with other clinically relevant data.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7b2db6f25d2114eaa1c9b8a2a5a553d92cb9d41","amp;dn":"Electrical+Neuroimaging+2009+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7b2db6f25d2114eaa1c9b8a2a5a553d92cb9d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,178,219,111,37,210,17,78,170,28,155,138,42,90,85,61,146,203,157,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
