Note that the performers on these cds are different from those on my previous upload of Jindo Ssitgimgut. The previous upload featured National asset holders for Jindo Ssitgimgut, based in Sopo-ri, Jisan-myeong, Jindo-gun. The artists on this Cd are based in Uisin-myeon, a village about 20 km from Sopo-ri. The Uisin group uses fewer instruments (on this recording) and the songs are mostly different from the Sopo group.  \n\nTracks:\n\nCD1\n1.
