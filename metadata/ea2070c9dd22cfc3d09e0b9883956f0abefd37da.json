What's there not to understand?\n\n1. Our crack method is not a loader (Show us please where the loader\n   part is inside the exe. You can't, so stop your bullshit)\n\n2. Our method/release is following the current iso ruleset\n\n3. GENESIS release is already EU retail and multi 5. Even through their\n   is tagged german, then it's still multi 5 and feature english, which\n   means yours is both a dupe of ours and theirs\n\nLike we mentioned in the beginning, then this invalid proper from today\nis nothing more than a dupe. Furthermore then this same group think\nthat we used a russian P2P release. Just because the game is supplied\nby a russian frind of the family, then it does not mean it's got roots\nin the P2P scene. Saying we used P2P as source for our supply is stupid\nand foolish, just because you didn't win the release and desperately in\nneed of a reason to proper\n\nOur release works 100% and is not using a loader. So it's beyond our\nwildest imginations that this same group who tried to proper us today\nis the same group with all the scene history behind it, because it seem\ntheir strongest asset is false accusations and endless garbage talk\n\nRELEASE NOTES\n\nCHANGELOG:\n\nFixes\n\n- Stability issues are solved\n- Balancing and difficulty updates\n- Faith related Relics optimized\n- Cavalry momentum under high game speed fixed\n- Behavior of shocked AI units upgraded\n- Crusader campaign, Bagdad mission restart bug fixed\n- Skill issues after unit upgrade fixed\n- Unit parameter info bug fixed\n- Bugs at active hero skills fixed\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
