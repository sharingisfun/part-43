When local Postie, Podger Byrnes, comes up with a\n     plan to hijack a consignment of Viagra, and sell it on the\n     open market in Amsterdam his friends are desperate enough to\n     try it. Not counting on the muscular response of Viagra's \n     makers, the boys panic and hide the lorry load of Viagra down\n     the town's Holy Well.\n   \n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1292652/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1292652/&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n    \n     \n     \n             ..
