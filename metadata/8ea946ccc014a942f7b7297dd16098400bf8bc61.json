It teamed the musical group with record producer Mike Howlett again, except on the single release &quot;(It's Not Me) Talking&quot; which was produced by Bill Nelson. The record included the UK Top 10 hit &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot;. The shape of a person's face on its sleeve cover is in fact the band's drummer, Ali Score.\n\nA Flock Of Seagulls (also known as Flock Of Seagulls) is a British Grammy Award-winning band originally formed by brothers Michael &quot;Mike&quot; Score (keyboards, vocals) and Alister &quot;Ali&quot; James Score (drums), with Frank Maudsley (bass) and Paul Reynolds (guitar).\n\nThe group had a string of international hit singles including &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;, &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot; &quot;Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)&quot; and &quot;The More You Live, the More You Love&quot;, and became notable in the 1980s for their MTV video for the song &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot;.\n\nAlthough parodied in later years, the band is now recognized as a pioneering act, capturing the zeitgeist of their time, particularly with multi-layered hits such as &quot;Space Age Love Song&quot;, &quot;Telecommunication&quot; and &quot;Modern Love is Automatic&quot;.\n\nIn November 2003, the original line-up (Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley) reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series, Bands Reunited. In September 2004, they reformed again and played a small number of live shows in the United States, but broke up immediately afterward. Mike Score continues to tour with other musicians as A Flock Of Seagulls.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_(A_Flock_of_Seagulls_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listen_(A_Flock_of_Seagulls_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAdHKAAdo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAdHKAAdo&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 4700kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:04:05\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \n\nIt's 100% free to download and use.
