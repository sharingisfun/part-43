With Cisco Network Magic Pro 5.5, you can avoid lengthy, tech support phone calls, hard to navigate online forums and expensive on-site consultants. Network Magic Pro provides do-it-yourself tools for setting up, managing and securing your network.\n\nEasy to UseInterface\n\nIntuitive interface includes network map, plus in-product wizards streamline networking tasks, taking the guesswork and effort out of getting connected, monitoring activity and repairing your network.\n\nOnce your network is up and running, Cisco Network Magic makes it easy to see what is happening on the network through a Network Map which is a visual representation of all the devices that are connected to your home network, as well as possible intruders.\n\nThe map also provides additional details about those devices, including IP addresses, connection status, alerts about software updates, as well as easy access to any tasks related to each device. By utilizing the features of the map, you can view and control many aspects of your networked devices, without having to go to each device individually.\nConnect and Share\n\nShare an Internet connection with other computers and devices. Connect printers, cameras and DVRs in minutes. Connect storage devices to your home network to easily back up your data.\n\nConnect and Share\n\nTo share files with your other computers, simply click on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShare a FolderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a software setup program known as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwizardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ walks you through the steps. If you want to see what folders are shared on one computer, or all of your networked computers, you can do that as well. Cisco Network Magic even puts a shortcut on your desktop, making it easy to access all the music, photos, videos and other files available on your networked computers.\n\nWith multiple computers in a household, it becomes very cumbersome and expensive to outfit each one with its own printer. If you want to share a printer among multiple computers, Cisco Network Magic has an easy setup process. The program will make the printer available to all computers on the network, and will even automatically install the printer drivers on the different PCs for you.\n\nNetwork and Family Protection\n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re like millions of concerned parents, you worry about the content that your children are exposed to on the Internet. Perhaps you would also like to control when your children have access to the Internet. With the Internet Access Controls in Cisco Network Magic, you can do all of this and more.\n\nCisco Network Magic offers controls that allow you to manage when and where your networked computers access the Internet. You can restrict Internet access to certain times of the day, making sure your kids are doing their homework and not surfing the web or chatting with their friends online. All of this can be done remotely, via a password-enabled tool so the controls you put in place stay there.\nPatch Releaser\nAvAtAr\nDownload Size\nmb\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSystem Requirements\nit will work no worries m8s\nLanguage\nEnglish\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ninfo hash\n\nOriginal Source\ntrzype\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTracker by\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/scrape&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://genesis.1337x.org:1337/scrape&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://open.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce\n\n\ninstallation notes\nread install notes m8s\n\n[b]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScreen Shots\nPosted Image\nPosted Image\nPosted Image\n\nOfficial Site\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.purenetworks.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.purenetworks.com/&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6fffe8bd83318c167a2de23243513186cf0afc","amp;dn":"Cisco_Network_Magic_v5.0.8282%2Bpatch_g4m3fre4k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b6fffe8bd83318c167a2de23243513186cf0afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,111,255,232,189,131,49,140,22,122,45,226,50,67,81,49,134,207,10,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
