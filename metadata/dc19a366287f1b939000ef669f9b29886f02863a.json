As Robbie's health slides radically downhill, however, she becomes frustrated and desperate, and so does her own research into the existing literature on treatments. When she decides to try an alternative treatment called the Ketogenic Diet, devised long ago by a doctor from Johns Hopkins, she is met with narrow-minded resistance from Robbie's doctor, who is prepared to take legal action to prevent Lori from removing him from the hospital. This movie is an indictment of those in the medical profession who discuss only the treatment options they favor. Several of the minor characters are portrayed by people who have been not just helped, but cured by the Ketogenic diet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc19a366287f1b939000ef669f9b29886f02863a","amp;dn":"First+Do+No+Harm+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc19a366287f1b939000ef669f9b29886f02863a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,25,163,102,40,127,27,147,144,0,239,102,159,155,41,136,111,2,134,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
