With the Windows drivers, you may need to remap the Up/Down axis\nof the right stick through the in-game options menu for it to work properly.\n\n* ATI Eye Infinity and Matrox TripleHead2Go\nThese peripherals are supported in the singleplayer mode but not in multiplayer.\n\n* MadCatz Modern Warfare controller\nTo use this pad, install the madcatz, saitek software. Then use the pad in-game\nwith a mouse/keyboard configuration. (the madcatz, saitek software emulates a mouse\nand keyboard) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=213&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.madcatz.com/Default.asp?Page=213&lt;/a&gt;\nIt works as a keyboard mouse emulator instead of native gamepad controls.\n\n* Generic controllers display problem in Hud and Menu\nOn some controllers with letter buttons, the game will display them as numbers using\nDirectInput.\n\n* If using Realtek High Definition Audio, Soundmax HD Audio, or nForce Audio, you\nmay experience sound anomalies. To work around the problem, reduce the Hardware\nacceleration slider to 'Basic' in the Windows Control Panel -&gt; Sounds and Audio\nDevices -&gt; Audio tab -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Performance tab.\n\n* Some SFX are playing too loud when the sfx setting is at 1.\n\n* If using an AMD dual-core processor, you may experience fast flickering of the\nin-game menu items. To work around this problem, install the AMD Dual-Core\nOptimizer available on the AMD web site (see section 3.2).\n\n* If you experience graphical corruption, make sure your graphics driver's\ncontrol panel is _not_ configured to override application settings.\n\n[/code]\n\n[img]http://www.imagefreeks.com/out.php/i86_screens.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/51072100264261601903.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/44834667292673127137.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/03043693733555424726.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbae51f07a5f4ef814da2b74ec53216e1e0013c","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+Brotherhood+-+CloneDVD+-+Multi+11+TEAM+WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbae51f07a5f4ef814da2b74ec53216e1e0013c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,186,229,31,7,165,244,239,129,77,162,183,78,197,50,22,225,224,1,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
