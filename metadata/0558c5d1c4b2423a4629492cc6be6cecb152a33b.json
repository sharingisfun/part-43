The sound quality is not all that great but definitely worth a listen. Just make sure you have lots of beer handy when you do!\n\nCountry MikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Hits is the legendary full length country album recorded by the Beastie Boys. Never officially released, it was originally only given out to family and friends of the Beasties as a Christmas gift back in 1999, and bootlegs started showing up a few years later. It has proved to be a very hot collectible, supposedly fetching as much as four hundred dollars on eBay. The only official reference to the album appears on the Beastie Boys compilation The Sounds of Science, which also includes two songs, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRailroad BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCountry MikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Theme.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In the liner notes, Adam Yauch explains ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAt some point after Ill Communication came out, Mike got hit in the head by a large foreign object and lost all of his memory. As it started coming back he believed that he was a country singer named Country Mike. The Psychologists told us that if we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play along with MikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fantasy, he could be in grave danger. Finally he came back to his senses. This song (Railroad Blues) is one of the many that we made during that tragic period of time.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNeedless to say this is an odd record. The boys clearly had fun making it, although itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not as over the top as you might expect. The overall musicianship is decent, particularly the pedal steel work, giving it a down-home authenticity. There are also some zanier moments that reminded me of BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early acoustic recordings (letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just say that Mike D ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly a crooner). Overall the album is definitely an interesting curiosity for any Beastie Boys fan.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Sloppy Drunks\n02.Railroad Blues\n03.We Can Do This\n04.Country Delight\n05.Don't Let The Air Out My Tires\n06.How Do U Mend An Achin' Heart\n07.One Song A Night\n08.Country Christmas\n09.The Ballad Of Kenny Jones\n10.Country Mike's Theme\n11.On Your Way Up Again\n12.We Can Do This (Live)\n13.The Half-Wit\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0558c5d1c4b2423a4629492cc6be6cecb152a33b","amp;dn":"Beastie+Boys+-+Country+Mike%5C%27s+Greatest+Hits+%5C%2798+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0558c5d1c4b2423a4629492cc6be6cecb152a33b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,88,197,209,196,178,66,58,70,41,73,44,198,190,108,236,177,82,163,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
