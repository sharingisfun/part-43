He again joins\n      the Phelps family on their controversial pickets where they try\n      to antagonise communities with offensive slogans and anti-gay\n      placards. But four years on from Louis's last visit, there are\n      signs of disarray in the Phelps clan. A series of defections of\n      family members has shaken up the church.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
