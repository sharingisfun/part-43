Until now the only stand alone version of the song was a rip that didn't include Randy's vocals.\n\nNow the full song has been released as a digital download single, and here it is, Randy screaming and all! :)\n\nTo be honest, there's a torrent with an m4a file floating around too. I took that file, converted it and reuploaded it. Thought I'd save you lot the trouble of converting it yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2c989b69d4665d069949e4b728875aed4fa4c26","amp;dn":"Lamb+of+God+-+Hit+the+Wall+-+full+mp3+with+vocals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2c989b69d4665d069949e4b728875aed4fa4c26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,201,137,182,157,70,101,208,105,148,158,75,114,136,117,174,212,250,76,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
