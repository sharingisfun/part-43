Well i was the same, until I got majorly pissed that the only way i could watch it at will was to either buy the DVD, watch it subbed, or watch it online at a rate of 3 fps &gt;:(. So what i did was find what seemed to be the only good copy on the internet, streamed it, and then went through the painstaking task of finding a program that could extract it from the temps (I used VideoCacheView by the way). So seriously guys, PLEASE SEED BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT MORE TROUBLE THAN IT SOUNDS! All that was from my previous torrent, Death Note Movie Trilogy English Dub (Kevin Wood), and this is basically the same thing exept that this time i decided to make it an all-in-one package :P. Seriously though, pls comment and seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96ff5f2d1f2814fcb69cf7c03b795078eaeb7183","amp;dn":"Death+Note+Complete+Set+All+Movies+All+Episodes+All+Dubbed+%28Kevi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96ff5f2d1f2814fcb69cf7c03b795078eaeb7183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,255,95,45,31,40,20,252,182,156,247,192,59,121,80,120,234,235,113,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
