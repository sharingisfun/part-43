CD 3 of 3\nOrig Year:  1958\nLabel:  Original Jazz Classics \nRelease Date  Jul 01, 1991  \nQuality: mp3 320 kbps\n\nThe amazing piano work of Hampton Hawes plus Jim HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar magic in an extended and uninterrupted late-night session!  This 3 CD collection compiles the complete ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll Night SessionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which originally appeared on 3 LPs.\n\nRecorded in just one night - from the late hours of November 12 to the early hours of November 13, 1956 - this session is more like a live date than a trip to the studios, with no repeated numbers and, consequently, no alternate takes.\n\nWhile Hawes was most often heard in a trio format, this release showcases the pianist in a quartet.  A follower of Charlie Parker in both his music and lifestyle, Hawes waxed this recording nearly two years before being imprisoned for drug possession.  Although he was supposed to serve a five-year jail term, his sentence was revoked by President John F. Kennedy.  Hawes resumed his career after his release, playing and recording until suffering a fatal stroke in Los Angeles, on May 22, 1977. \n\nHampton Hawes Quartet:\nHampton Hawes (piano)\nJim Hall (guitar)\nRed Mitchell (bass)\nBruz Freeman (drums) \n\nHampton Hawes Quartet - All Night Session!
