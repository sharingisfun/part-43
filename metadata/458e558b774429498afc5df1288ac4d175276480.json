Preprints xvi Preface:  What This Book \nIs About can be published on the Internet before or without ever being refereed.  Overhead \nprojectors have disappeared from scientific meetings in favor of LCD projectors and laptop \ncomputers. RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s are often distributed electronically. This update of A PhD Is Not Enough!\ncomes abreast of these changes, though the basic content of the  original remains timely.\nThe communications revolution cannot be ignored but has not made it less important to be \nthoughtful about choosing your career path or to respect audiences and readers.   I still \nattend talks that make me squirm and struggle to read sleep-inducing scientific articles.\n I hope attentive readers of this book will reap the rewards of doing better.
