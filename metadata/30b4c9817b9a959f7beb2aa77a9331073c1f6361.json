I had a blast doing it. Most of the time I would stay in one place and listen to the music until it would loop.\n\nmethod used:\nI hooked up the optical digital output of my PS3 to a Sony Dolby certified amplifier, and used it to downmix to stereo the 5.1 signal.\nFrom there I hooked up into my computer, and recorded into wav files using direct-to-disc.\nI then used Audacity 1.3beta to trim silences, and to do fade in and/or out when needed.\nI tried to retain the original wav as maximum as possible, my objective was to just rip, no more.\nEverything was done in CD quality (44Khz, 16bit Stereo)\nMP3 encoding was done using lame's highest setting, in 320 constant bitrate, full stereo (not joint).\nAll mp3 tracks are properly and thoroughly id3v2 tagged.\n\n99 tracks, total duration: 3h42\n\n\nThe tracks are more or less in the chronological order of a playthrough\n\nAll credits go to the fantastic Jesper. I admire his work, and enjoy the music big time. I'm sure you do too.\n\nPackage Description:\n\nAll mp3 tracks\ncover.jpg = custom made album art\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jesperkyd.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jesperkyd.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30b4c9817b9a959f7beb2aa77a9331073c1f6361","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+BrotherhooD+Unoffical+soundtracK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30b4c9817b9a959f7beb2aa77a9331073c1f6361","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,180,201,129,123,154,149,159,123,235,42,167,122,147,49,7,60,31,99,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
