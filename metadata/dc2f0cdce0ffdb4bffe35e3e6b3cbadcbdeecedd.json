The concert itself is a wonder to behold, as Portishead (Geoff Barrows, Adrian Utley, Beth Gibbons, Andy Smith) smoke cigarettes, chew gum, scratch records, and behave in a generally hip manner while around them the 30-piece New York Philharmonic Orchestra and a 5-piece horn ensemble do their thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc2f0cdce0ffdb4bffe35e3e6b3cbadcbdeecedd","amp;dn":"Portishead+-+Roseland+New+York+City+live+%281997%29+by+apoteka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc2f0cdce0ffdb4bffe35e3e6b3cbadcbdeecedd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,47,12,220,224,255,219,75,255,227,94,62,107,60,186,220,189,238,206,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
