The album is heavily produced by grammy- nominated long time friend and collaborator Anthony Bell with an addition production cut from Jason Farmer. Beautiful is the album's leading single and was released February 23, 2010.\n\nVivian approached the recording of BEAUTIFUL in a more intimate, organic manner. With the exception of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave Me,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which she cut with Jason Farmer (Keyshia Cole, Rihanna, Wyclef Jean) in the producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seat, Vivian recorded the entire album WITH GRAMMY-NOMINATED PRODUCER ANTHONY BELL, a longtime friend and collaborator who made key production contributions to her first two albums, and whose extensive credits also includes work with JAZMINE SULLIVAN, MUSIQ, RAHEEM DEVAUGHN and JILL SCOTT.\n\nLabel.........................: E1 Music\nGenre.........................: R&amp;B\nStoreDate.....................: Apr-06-2010\nSource........................: CDDA\nGrabber.......................: Exact Audio Copy\nEncoding Scheme...............: Lame 3.97 V2 VBR Joint-Stereo\nSize..........................: 63,0 MB\nTotal Playing Time............: 51:11\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
