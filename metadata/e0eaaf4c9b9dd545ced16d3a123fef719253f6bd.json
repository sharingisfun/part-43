The album marks Tyner's move from Impulse to Blue Note, and he sounds suitably energized, playing challenging post-bop that, while lacking the revolutionary fervor of A Love Supreme, for example, still occupies the front ranks of the forward-thinking jazz of the era.\n\nTyner is joined by his former Coltrane cohort Elvin Jones on drums, stalwart bassist Ron Carter, and the underrated saxophonist Joe Henderson. The quartet acquits itself admirably on five Tyner compositions, among which &quot;Passion Dance&quot; and &quot;Four By Five&quot; are the best. Coltrane's influence can be heard throughout the album, especially in the sinuous, modal approach and in Henderson's ambitious solos, but Tyner's powerful playing, wholly his own, steals the show.\n\nRecorded at the Van Gelder Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on April 21, 1967. Originally released on Blue Note (4264). \n\n\nMcCoy Tyner (piano); Joe Henderson (tenor saxophone); Ron Carter (bass); Elvin Jones (drums).\n\n\n1.Passion Dance \n2.Contemplation \n3.Four by Five \n4.Search For Peace \n5.Blues on the Corner\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0eaaf4c9b9dd545ced16d3a123fef719253f6bd","amp;dn":"McCoy+Tyner+The+Real+McCoy%28jazz%29%28flac%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0eaaf4c9b9dd545ced16d3a123fef719253f6bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,234,175,76,155,157,213,69,206,209,109,58,18,63,239,113,146,83,246,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
