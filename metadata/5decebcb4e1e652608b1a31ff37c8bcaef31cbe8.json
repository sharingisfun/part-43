This happens also if you run or install it on a PC where you have already runned a &quot;not-so-legal&quot; version of it. If this is your case, just run UnLock.reg to remove the block.\n\n\nBecause no two DJs are the same, we think that every DJ should have a custom-made, tailored software application. VirtualDJ 6 has been centered around a new language, called VDJscript, that really lets you take full control and full ownership of your software, and tweak it to your perfect liking in a matter of minutes.\n\nWith VirtualDJ 6, all the commands used in skins, keyboard shortcuts, controllers' mappings, etc, now use VDJscript.\n\nVDJscript language has been designed to be both simple and complex, depending on how you will use it.\n\nWhen used for your day to day needs, VDJscript is very simple, and look similar to the actions from VirtualDJ v5.x. You can write such commands as play, pause, crossfader 50%, etc.\n\nBut if you have more complex needs, VDJscript can turn into a full scripting language, complete with global variables, conditional branching, etc. You can write such commands as var $myvar ? pitch_range '10,16,50' : goto 400ms &amp; loop 4 while_pressed\n\n\nMore infos at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virtualdj.com/products/virtualdj/version6.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virtualdj.com/products/virtualdj/version6.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5decebcb4e1e652608b1a31ff37c8bcaef31cbe8","amp;dn":"Atomix+VirtualDJ+v6.0.2+Pro+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5decebcb4e1e652608b1a31ff37c8bcaef31cbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,236,235,203,78,30,101,38,8,177,163,31,243,124,139,202,239,49,203,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
