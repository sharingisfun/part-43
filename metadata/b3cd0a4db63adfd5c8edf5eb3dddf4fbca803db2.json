But fans of older works like Born to Run\nwill find the venue switch dovetails nicely with a change in musical style.\n\nThe Boss performs songs from his new album, We Shall Overcome: The\nSeeger Sessions, which consists of folk standards and spirituals popularised\nby the American folk legend, Pete Seeger. According to the bbc.co.uk/music\nalbum review, it's 'a fine example of a contemporary artist taking great\ndelight in collaborating with crack musicians and mining his country's\nsongwriting past.'\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://h.imagehost.org/view/0502/Thumbs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://h.imagehost.org/view/0502/Thumbs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSet list\n\nJohn Henry\nOh Mary Don't You Weep\nHow Can A Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?\nMrs McGrath\nMy Oklahoma Home\nJacob's Ladder\nWe Shall Overcome\nPay Me My Money Down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3cd0a4db63adfd5c8edf5eb3dddf4fbca803db2","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Sessions+-+Bruce+Springsteen+%5B+x264+-+mp3+-+mkv+%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3cd0a4db63adfd5c8edf5eb3dddf4fbca803db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,205,10,77,182,58,223,213,200,237,245,235,61,221,244,251,202,128,61,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
