In the latter picture, Tierney  starts \n\nthe ball rolling by committing a double murder in a jealous pique. Claire Trevor discovers the bodies, but says \n\nnothing to the police; she's leaving town and doesn't want to be impeded. Trevor and Tierney  meet and fall in love \n\non the train to San Francisco. Unfortunately, Trevor  is married, so Tierney shifts his affections to her sister, \n\nAudrey Long (later the wife of director Billy Wilder). He marries Long, though he keeps up his illicit affair with \n\nTrevor. When detectives investigating the murders come snooping, they are bought off by Tierney's pal Elisha \n\nCook Jr.--who is then murdered by Tierney, who suspects that Cook is carrying on with Trevor  (Cook  seldom \n\nsurvived to the end of any of his films). When Tierney  finally does face arrest, it's at the instigation of the jealous \n\nTrevor, who is shot full of holes for her trouble. Born to Kill was based on James Gunn's novel Deadlier Than the \n\nMale.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Born to Kill.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.11 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 1 526 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 1 005 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 126 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039211/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039211/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subpack (idx/sub)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957eb7facf8768ad818c21317e310f9db80f2080","amp;dn":"Robert+Wise+-+Born+To+Kill+%281947%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957eb7facf8768ad818c21317e310f9db80f2080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,126,183,250,207,135,104,173,129,140,33,49,126,49,15,157,184,15,32,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
