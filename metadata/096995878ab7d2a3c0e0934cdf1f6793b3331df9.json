Frequent guitar foil Waddy Wachtel produced the sessions, and a number of other friends and collaborators from his salad days also popped up, including David Lindley, Jorge Calderon, Jim Keltner, and Jeff Porcaro. But if Mr. Bad Example was leaner, breezier, and more concise than the two discs that preceded it, it also carried an air of Zevon battling against the sound and style fans expected of him, and reflected the mind of an artist who had learned to pursue his own vision no matter what others expected of him. &quot;Finishing Touches&quot; is as bitter a kiss-off to a former lover as anyone has committed to plastic, &quot;Model Citizen&quot; is hardly more charitable in its depiction of an unfortunately average guy (&quot;It's the white man's burden/And it weighs a ton&quot;), and &quot;Susie Lightning&quot; and &quot;Angel Dressed in Black&quot; are witty but mordant commentaries on love in the '90s. However, that's not to say that Zevon is without a sense of humor; the title cut is a hilarious shaggy dog tale of one man's love affair with global irresponsibility, and &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead&quot; is worthy of its title. And while the final cut is called &quot;Searching for a Heart,&quot; the song confirms Zevon had one that was battered but still functioning when he recorded this album. Mr. Bad Example doesn't make an immediate connection like some of Warren Zevon's best work, but the songs are well-crafted and it grows with repeated listening.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWarren Zevon - guitar, keyboards, vocals\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n - bass, harmony vocals\nDan Dugmore - guitar, pedal steel\nBob Glaub - bass\nJim Keltner - drums\nTito Larriva - harmony vocals on &quot;Angel Dressed in Black&quot;\nKipp Lennon - harmony vocals on &quot;Searching for a Heart&quot;\nMark Lennon - harmony vocals on &quot;Searching for a Heart&quot;\nMichael Lennon - harmony vocals on &quot;Searching for a Heart&quot;\nDavid Lindley - fiddle, saz, lap steel guitar, cumbus\nJeff Porcaro - drums\nWaddy Wachtel - guitar, harmony vocals\nDwight Yoakam - harmony vocals on &quot;Heartache Spoken Here&quot;\nJordan Zevon - harmony vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Finishing Touches&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n2.&quot;Suzie Lightning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n3.&quot;Model Citizen&quot; (LeRoy Marinell, Waddy Wachtel, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n4.&quot;Angel Dressed in Black&quot; (Mueller, Wachtel, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:24\n5.&quot;Mr. Bad Example&quot; (Jorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n6.&quot;Renegade&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:51\n7.&quot;Heartache Spoken Here&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n8.&quot;Quite Ugly One Morning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n9.&quot;Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead&quot; (Marinell, Wachtel, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:53\n10.&quot;Searching for a Heart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n\nAll tracks composed by Warren Zevon, except where indicated.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096995878ab7d2a3c0e0934cdf1f6793b3331df9","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+Mr.+Bad+Example++%5B1991%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%7BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096995878ab7d2a3c0e0934cdf1f6793b3331df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,105,149,135,138,183,210,163,192,224,147,76,223,31,103,147,179,51,29,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
