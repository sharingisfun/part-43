By issue #10, Destiny was the only one of these who remained a regular.\n\nDebuting in 1975, Secrets of Haunted House started and stopped several times until issue #14, when it continued until series end in 1982.\n\nLater in the series, the Mister E character came into being, where he was a recurring character for ten issues, competing with the likes of Johnny Peril, Dr. 13, and I, Vampire - regulars of DC's other horror titles.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ee4eb250598e97453a8575878407c3ed42bd3d","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Haunted+House+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ee4eb250598e97453a8575878407c3ed42bd3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,238,78,178,80,89,142,151,69,58,133,117,135,132,7,195,237,66,189,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
