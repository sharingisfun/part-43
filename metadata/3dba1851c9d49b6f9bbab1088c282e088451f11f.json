Emotionally Fuelled By The Death Of Gray's Father And The Birth Of His Son, It Possesses Much The Same Tone As White Ladder, Being Simultaneously Celebratory And Troubled. The Album, Though, Is Slow Starting. &quot;Caroline&quot;, With Its Rattling Percussion And Quasi-Celtic Pedal Steel Excursions Is A Bit Messy, While &quot;Long Distance Call&quot;, Mixing An Orchestra With Electronic Effects, Is An Interesting Collage But Not Much Of A Song. Both Give The Impression That Gray's Trying To Appear More Cutting-Edge Than He Actually Is. It's With &quot;Freedom&quot;, When That Big Piano Deepens And The Pain Enters His Voice, That He Really Gets Going. This Leads To The Excellent &quot;Kangaroo&quot; And &quot;Last Boat To America&quot;, Both Yearning And Teeming With Striking Lyrical Images. Then It Really Takes Off, With The Stones-Y Rock Groove Of &quot;Real Love&quot; And The Gospel Feel Of &quot;Knowhere&quot;, Leading To The Quite Brilliant Unrequited Love Song &quot;Be Mine&quot; And Crushing Closer &quot;The Other Side&quot;.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Dead In The Water\n[02] Caroline\n[03] Long Distance Call\n[04] Freedom\n[05] Kangaroo\n[06] Last Boat To America\n[07] Real Love\n[08] Knowhere\n[09] December\n[10] Be Mine\n[11] Easy Way To Cry\n[12] The Other Side\n \n\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 00h:50m:31s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 121 mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Release\t\t- 02 November 2002\n\nRecord Company\t\t- iht Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.davidgray.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/DavidGray \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/David+Gray \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dba1851c9d49b6f9bbab1088c282e088451f11f","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+A+New+Day+At+Midnight+-+David+Gray+-+121mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dba1851c9d49b6f9bbab1088c282e088451f11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,186,24,81,201,212,155,111,155,186,177,8,140,40,46,8,132,81,241,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
