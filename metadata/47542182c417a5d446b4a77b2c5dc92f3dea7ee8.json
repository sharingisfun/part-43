Rescue sister. 2. Murder grandmother. 3. Don't upset the voodoo priestess.\n\nThe clock is ticking for Sabina Kane. Her sister has been kidnapped by her grandmother, the Dark Races are on the brink of war, and a mysterious order is manipulating everyone behind the scenes. Working on information provided by an unlikely ally, Sabina and her trusty sidekicks---a sexy mage named Adam Lazarus and Giguhl, a Mischief demon---head to New Orleans to begin the hunt for her sister. Once there, they must contend with belligerent werewolves, magic-wielding vampires, and, perhaps most frightening of all, humans. But as much as Sabina is focused on surviving the present, the past won't be ignored. Before she can save those she cares about most, she must save herself from the ghosts of her past.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47542182c417a5d446b4a77b2c5dc92f3dea7ee8","amp;dn":"Green-Eyed+Demon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47542182c417a5d446b4a77b2c5dc92f3dea7ee8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,84,33,130,196,23,165,212,70,180,167,123,44,93,201,47,61,234,126,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
