To even refer to him as a guitar player is probably a gross mislabeling of this musician. He defies any sort of categorization; this is his greatest strength and for some his weakness. The theme for these nine cuts is rhythm of all different ilk. It is impossible to give the parameters because he seems to have none. You may wonder how many different instruments he played on this album; it only says guitar and vocal for his credits. Listen to his version of &quot;All Shook Up,&quot; more bop and rhythm than Elvis could put into four of his songs. It seems musicians line up to play with him, and they feel he did them a favor by letting them play on his albums. He always gives them plenty of space to do what they do. This CD will make the dead start tapping their toes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nRy Cooder : Guitar, Vocals\n\nVan Dyke Parks : Keyboards\n\nFlaco Jimenez : Accordion\n\nSteve Douglas : Saxophone\n\nJorge Calderon : Electric Bass\n\nBuell Niedlinger : Acoustic Bass\n\nJim Keltner : Drums\n\nMiguel Cruz : Percussion\n\nVocals : Bobby King, Terry Evans, Arnold McCuller, Willie Greene Jr., Larry Blackmon, Harry Dean Stanton\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n\nGet Rhythm\n\nLow-Commotion\n\nGoing Back To Okinawa\n\n13 Question Method\n\nWomen Will Rule The World\n\nAll Shook Up\n\nI Can Tell By The Way You Smell\n\nAcross The Borderline\n\nLet's Have A Ball\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25bcc597974fd5f99de613066e80cabc065f8462","amp;dn":"Ry+Cooder+-+Get+Rhythm++%5B1987%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25bcc597974fd5f99de613066e80cabc065f8462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,188,197,151,151,79,213,249,157,230,19,6,110,128,202,188,6,95,132,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
