An experiential exploration? Not only will you learn about these technologies, you will learn to recreate them. Instructions are given for making bronze from metal ores; glass from sand, ashes, and limestone; paper from grass or straw; soap from fat; alcohol from honey; photographs from egg whites; chlorine from salt water and celluloid from cotton.\n\nYour guides on this journey are the four alchemical elements; Fire, Earth, Air and Water. These archetypal characters deliver first-hand accounts of the births of their respective technologies. The spirit of Fire, for example, was born in the first creature to cultivate the flame. This spirit passed from one person to another, from one generation to another, from one millennium to another, arriving at last in the pages of this book. The spirit of Earth taught folks to make tools of stone, the spirit of Air imparted knowledge of units and the spirit of Water began with the invention of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspirits.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Having traveled the world from age to age, who can say where they will find their next home? Perhaps they will find one in you.\n\n================\n\nIf you like this book, I suggest buying a hard copy ($29.95 US) or a PDF ($15.00 US) from http://www.cavemanchemistry.com/buyit.html The PDF edition has full-color graphics.\n\nApart from buying, you can do many other interesting thing of the book's webpage, like see the forum.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b990f8778c683dbfee62cfaaea30b98de590974c","amp;dn":"28+Projects%2C+from+the+Creation+of+Fire+to+the+Production+of+Plas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b990f8778c683dbfee62cfaaea30b98de590974c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,144,248,119,140,104,61,191,238,98,207,170,234,48,185,141,229,144,151,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
