It was recorded in Rome (in July 1972) and Frankfurt (October 1972) using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. It was Deep Purple's last album with the Mark II lineup of the group until Perfect Strangers (1984).\n\nAlthough &quot;Woman from Tokyo&quot; was a hit single, the group - riven with internal strife - struggled to come up with tracks of the quality of their previous three albums (and first live album). Although it hit number 4 in the UK charts and number 15 in the US charts, it did not sell as well as previous albums. Nonetheless, Deep Purple was the best selling artist in the USA in 1973. The album was certified Gold on April 11, 1973 by the RIAA, selling 500,000 copies in the US.\n\nOn the back cover of the album, &quot;Woman From Tokyo&quot; is misspelled &quot;WOMAN FROM TOKAYO&quot; which reflects the way in which the word was pronounced in the vocals by Ian Gillan.\n\nDeep Purple are an English rock band formed in Hertford in 1968. Along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, they are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, although some band members believe that their music cannot be categorised as belonging to any one genre. The band incorporated classical music, blues-rock, pop and progressive rock elements. They were once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as &quot;the loudest pop group&quot;, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. Deep Purple were ranked #22 on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock program.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_from_Tokyo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_from_Tokyo&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaDHEAaDo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/oaDHEAaDo&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (16:9) 29.97fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:44\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
