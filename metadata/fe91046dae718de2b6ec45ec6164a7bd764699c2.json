This torrent represents a work of LOVE. All texts so far gathered, as well as all future gatherings, aim to facilitate the studies of sincere students. Future releases will include submissions from users like YOU.\n\nDigimob's archive provides an invaluable service to dedicated students of the occult sciences, and a forum community has been created to provide a platform for these students to engage in respectful discourse on topics related to our releases. Further information on this release can be found there, at digimob.tk.\n\nFor some of us, the time has come to mobilize.
