He still pays homage to his mentor, Muddy Waters, not only through covers but simply through his driving musical style. He blends the familiar (\\&quot;Rip It Up,\\&quot; \\&quot;Going Home,\\&quot; \\&quot;The Same Thing\\&quot;) with unpredictable (\\&quot;See Me in the Evening,\\&quot; \\&quot;Drip Drop,\\&quot; \\&quot;Peace of Mind\\&quot;) in his choice of covers, and he has written a set of originals that are sturdy and memorable. Furthermore, he has loosened up a little bit, bringing some jazzy flourishes to his solos and nuance to his vocals. The result is one of his strongest albums, one that is exciting upon the first listen and rewarding upon repeated plays. ~ Thom Owens\n\nTracklist\n1. Moving South - 3:56\n2.
