Purportedly the world's first album released for 5.1 systems, with it being fully composed for and &quot;constructed&quot; in 5.1 surround sound, it contains re-recorded versions of some of his most famous tracks, including tracks from OxygÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne and ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°quinoxe. Accompanying the audio, the DVD features a visual image of Anne Parillaud's eyes, recorded in real time as she listened to the album. Jarre used the minimalist imagery to reinforce the audio content of the DVD. The CD was mixed in super-stereo.\nIn his role of UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, Jarre performed a concert named Water for Life in Morocco, on 16 December 2006, to celebrate the year of desertification in the world. The performance was in front of the Erg Chebbi Dunes of Merzouga, in the Sahara. A free event, it was attended by about 25,000 people. Images of water and the environment were projected onto nine vertical screens, held in place by sand which was watered to keep it hard. Several permanent drinking fountains were built on the site, along with a permanent electricity installation. Jarre was accompanied by over 60 Moroccan artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:396a4a3b00820a7237ea13b22f0adddce98cb57d","amp;dn":"jean+michel+jarre+--+2004+--+aero+%28ac3+5.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"396a4a3b00820a7237ea13b22f0adddce98cb57d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,106,74,59,0,130,10,114,55,234,19,178,47,10,221,220,233,140,181,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
