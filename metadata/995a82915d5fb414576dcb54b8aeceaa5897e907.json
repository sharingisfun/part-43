But I have burned it, and watched it, so the quality is GREAT!\n\nIt seems that the source is from BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-WiKi, and customized by NITSUPORT (Thanks guys).\n\nOnce again I have not found a good SWESUB copy of WATCHMEN for DvDR / PAL, so this is why I upload this relese here and now...!      :)\n\n\nThe audio is English (Speech), and with Custom SWESUB. You can choose to watch it without subs as well.\n\nInfo:\n\n*****************************************************************************\nTitle     : WATCHMEN\nYear      : 2009\nGenre     : Action / Sci-Fi / Thriler / Mystery / Drama\nRuntime   : 162 minutes\n*****************************************************************************\nRAR       : 90x50 Mb\nSize      : 4,15 GB (4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 456Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 834Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 700 byte)\nTot Files : 91\n*****************************************************************************\nSource    : Watchmen.2009.BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-WiKi\nRipped    : Nitsuport\nMenu      : Costom made by: Nitsuport\nRip Date  : Unknown (in this download)\nNFO       : Yes\nSample    : NO\n*****************************************************************************\nAudio     : [x] English /AC3 /5.1 /6 channels\n\nVideo     : [ ] NTSC\n          : [x] PAL\n\nRatio     : [x] 16:9\n*****************************************************************************\nSubtitles : [ ] English\n            [x] Swedish (Custom)\n            [ ] Norwegian\n            [ ] Danish\n            [ ] Finnish\n*****************************************************************************\nImage Type: [x] ISO\n\nIMDB      : http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459/\n\n\n*****************************************************************************\n\nAnd as always, I NEVER SAVE CRAP ON MY COMPUTER, so therefor also this is a good quality Sound and Video movie.
