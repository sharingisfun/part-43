With Morrison behind the wheel the movie takes a lot of dark and somewhat twisted turns but even without any outside financial backing, he was able to hold it all together, complete this risky experimental film, and turn in an admiral acting performance considering that much of it is unscripted. HWY is considered by some to be the first American Indie movie; it predates the movie Easy Rider by two years and the quality is almost on par with that film. Jim Morrison made this film in the void following the demise of the Hollywood studio system and was aware that a change was happening. He realized that anyone could now make and distribute their own films. Morrison and his film &quot;HWY An American Pastoral&quot; were right on the edge of what seems like the exact moment our culture of mass media kicked in...kind of like the acid Jim loved to consume.\n\nQuality is not that good and has a timer on it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53195f738b0acd9e20f5333962d2775558000a92","amp;dn":"Jim+Morrison%5C%27s+film+HWY+-+An+American+Pastoral+1969","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53195f738b0acd9e20f5333962d2775558000a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,25,95,115,139,10,205,158,32,245,51,57,98,210,119,85,88,0,10,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
