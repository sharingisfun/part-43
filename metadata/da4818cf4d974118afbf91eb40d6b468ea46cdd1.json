For specific industries, such as architecture and engineering, MAXON also offers Editions that contain specially tailored functionality.\n\nThere is a CINEMA 4D to satisfy the needs of every artist and industry that utilizes 3D graphics. Take a tour through our solutions pages to see where CINEMA 4D dominates and thrives worldwide - then download a demo version and convince yourself.\n\nCINEMA 4D is available in several languages including English, German, French, Spanish, and more\n\nCINEMA 4D R11 New Feature List:\n\nNon-Linear Animation\n\nMove beyond the keyframe with the new non-linear animation system in CINEMA 4D Release 11. With non-linear animation, it's easy to build, layer and loop discreet motions containing hundreds of keyframes in complex hierarchies. You can easily block out animation based on predefined motions and build upon the basic movement by overlaying additional keyframes or motions.\n\nAnimation Layers\nAnimation layers allow you to build up a complex movement from individual layers, much like editing an image. You can block out the basic movement on one layer, then refine the motion with secondary animation layered on top. Define the &quot;opacity&quot; of each animation layer to control its influence over the final movement. In fact, you can animate the mix strength of each layer. Animation layers even work with complex hierarchies, allowing you to layer the animation of even the most complex character rigs.\n\nMotion Clips\nMotion Clips provide true non-linear animation functionality by allowing you to group complex keyframe animations on an entire hierarchy into a single clip that can be easily moved, layered or looped. Whether you're building motions for a character, defining presets animations for motion graphics or designing mechanical simulations, you can easily create a library of motions that can be dragged and dropped like video clips to define the final animation.CINEMA 4D automatically blends between each motion, or allows you to define the length and curve of the transition. Each clip can easily be looped, scaled or cropped; and just as with animation layers, motion clips can be layered with individual mix strength settings for each layer. The animation itself can be easily repositioned in 3D space using CINEMA 4D's new Pivot Object, making it easy to integrate your motions with one another and place the animation within the 3D environment.\n\nPivots\nThese little helpers come in handy if you need to change the direction of e.g. a walking character, without changing the walkcycle itself. Or if the character walks upon a moving surface (elevator, escalator). In this case only the pivot needs to be animated (move or rotate) and the character follows immediately.\n\nÃƒï¿½Ã…Â¾S: Windows x32 &amp; x64\n\nThe rest you have to look at homepage\n\nLanguage Us RU CZ De Es Fr Jp Kr ZN-CH \n\nTested and Working\n\nEnjoy\n\nThis will take some time to u/l since the other line going for a movie.Sorry:(","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4818cf4d974118afbf91eb40d6b468ea46cdd1","amp;dn":"Maxon+Cinema+4D+Studio+Bundle+v11.5514+build+RC20476+Multilingua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4818cf4d974118afbf91eb40d6b468ea46cdd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,72,24,207,77,151,65,24,175,191,145,235,64,214,180,104,234,70,205,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
