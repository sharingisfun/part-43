(only on the psp, not in the pc). By default it is disabled. If you installed 3.71 fatmsmod, do not use this setting, as its performance with 3.71 driver has not been tested. Instead, reinstall 5.00 m33-4 using dc8 and update to 5.00 m33-5. \n\nChanges in 5.00 M33-6: \nFixed a bug that made unbootable psp without memory stick or with a bad one. \n\n\n\nREADME IS INCLUDED.\n\n1.COPY UPDATE FOLDER TO ms0:/PSP/GAME\n\n2.RUN FROM GAME IN XMB\n\n3.SIT BACK AND WATCH\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7905fb5f75c302e072a57f1a03125166950a997","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5D5.00-M33-6+Update+Files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7905fb5f75c302e072a57f1a03125166950a997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,144,95,181,247,92,48,46,7,42,87,241,160,49,37,22,105,80,169,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
