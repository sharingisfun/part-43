The original Unreal soundtrack.  Not the extended 2 disc version, unfortunately.  This is ripped straight from the CD that I've had for years.  As of now, there are no other seeded torrents for this that I could find.  Hopefully I can make someone as happy as I was when I found the cd..\n\nNote: Towards the end of Chizra (Track 5) there are three audible clicks.  I'm guessing it's from a scratch on the cd or some other imperfection that I cannot see.  I'm not tech savvy enough to be able to fix it, but it really does not take anything away from the music.\n\nAll files are in .mp3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d5af3a84707fccd9348f3195ffdb5f2d2b6bb8c","amp;dn":"Unreal+Original+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d5af3a84707fccd9348f3195ffdb5f2d2b6bb8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,90,243,168,71,7,252,205,147,72,243,25,95,253,181,242,210,182,187,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
