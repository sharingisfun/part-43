(1961)\n\nReprise Records, @256 kbps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first album Sinatra recorded with the label that he founded, Reprise Records. The idea was to have an album without any ballads. Originally the song Have You Met Miss Jones? was going to be included, however, it was felt that the song did not fit, so it was left off. The album reached No. 4; it was given favorable reviews by Stereo Review, and, although a similar album (Sinatra's Swingin' Session!!!) was released by Capitol simultaneously, Ring-A-Ding-Ding! managed to maintain a 35 week stay on the charts. In the UK the album reached No. 8 and stayed for 9 weeks on the chart.\n\nThe title track was written specifically for Sinatra by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Track listing:\n\n\n\n   1. &quot;Ring-a-Ding Ding!&quot; (Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44\n   2. &quot;Let's Fall in Love&quot; (Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11\n   3. &quot;Be Careful, It's My Heart&quot; (Irving Berlin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n   4. &quot;A Foggy Day&quot; (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n   5. &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; (Jerome Kern, Dorothy Fields) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11\n   6. &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; (Cole Porter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n   7. &quot;The Coffee Song&quot; (Bob Hilliard, Dick Miles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n   8. &quot;When I Take My Sugar to Tea&quot; (Irving Kahal, Sammy Fain, Pierre Norman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:05\n   9. &quot;Let's Face the Music and Dance&quot; (Berlin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n  10. &quot;You'd Be So Easy to Love&quot; (Porter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:24\n  11. &quot;You and the Night and the Music&quot; (Arthur Schwartz, Howard Dietz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n  12. &quot;I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm&quot; (Berlin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:52\n\n          Bonus tracks included on the 1991 CD release:\n\n  13. &quot;Zing!
