Nietzsche uses a mixture of homilies, parables, epigrams and dreams to introduce some of his most striking doctrines, including the Overman, nihilism, and the eternal return of the same. This edition offers a new translation by Adrian Del Caro which restores the original versification of NietzscheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s text and captures its poetic brilliance. Robert PippinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s introduction discusses many of the most important interpretative issues raised by the work, including who is Zarathustra and what kind of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“heroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is he and what is the philosophical significance of the workÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s literary form?
