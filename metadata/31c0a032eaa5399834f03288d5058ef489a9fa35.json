The album is a mix between an Alternative rock and pop songs ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ written and co-written by Alley herself with the albums producers John Holliday, Trevor Steel and Peter-John Vettese. The album debuted on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart outside the top fifty at number sixty-four and only spent two weeks in the top one hundred. Two singles were released from the album in Australia; &quot;Falling&quot;, became Alley's first top ten single and nominated her for an ARIA Award and &quot;Dream the Day Away&quot; was a minor hit just peaking in the top fifty.\n\nAlley decided to start recording the album in February 2003 and went to London. She met up with producers and songwriters John Holliday, Trevor Steel and Peter-John Vettese to help with the album, she found them clever and complex people and she thought it was nice that they listened to what she said. The album saw Alley writing songs with Holliday, Steel and Vettese, which is something she never does because she writes on her own and she prefers writing on her own.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Candice Alley unless otherwise noted.\n\n   1. &quot;Falling&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:58\n   2. &quot;My Heaven&quot; (Alley, Trevor Steel, John Holliday) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:24\n   3. &quot;Shadow in Me&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 5:12\n   4. &quot;Dream the Day Away&quot; (Alley, Steel, Holliday) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:04\n   5. &quot;Surfacing&quot; (Alley, Peter-John Vettese) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:43\n   6. &quot;You Will Stay&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:01\n   7. &quot;To Find You&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:23\n   8. &quot;Tongue Tied&quot; (Alley, Rick Mitra, Elenni) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:14\n   9. &quot;In My Hands&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:22\n  10. &quot;She Dreams&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:05\n  11. &quot;Uncertainty&quot; (Alley, Steel, Holliday) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:17\n  12. &quot;Leaning on My Shoulder&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:43\n  13. &quot;It's in My Head&quot; (Alley, Vettese) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:16\n  14. &quot;Colorblind&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 1:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c0a032eaa5399834f03288d5058ef489a9fa35","amp;dn":"Candice+Alley+-+Colorblind+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c0a032eaa5399834f03288d5058ef489a9fa35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,192,160,50,234,165,57,152,52,240,50,136,213,5,142,244,137,169,250,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
