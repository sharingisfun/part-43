I am very saddened to see Dennis Hopper die and I intend to share a few more of his greater/rarer movies. This one does not have Dennis in it but it fits well with Easy Rider and thus the upload. Its too bad this guy ended up a murderer as this is a great film. Its often overlooked and most people have never seen it but its right up there as one of the greatest of its kind.\n\nThis is a full untouched dvd ripped using anydvd. Please do your part and stop sharing 700mb and dvds ripped to fit on dvd5! This is 2010. People can learn how to shrink their own damn dvds and if you are still on dialup stop being a cheap fucker and get a job! If you dont own a dvd burner thats ridiculous.\n\nA short Arizona motorcycle cop gets his wish and is promoted to Homicide following the mysterious murder of a hermit.
