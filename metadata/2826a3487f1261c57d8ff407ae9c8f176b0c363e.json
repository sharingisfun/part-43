It features R&amp;B singer T-Pain. &quot;All The Above&quot; was produced by Just Blaze (and co-produced by Nard &amp; B), the producer of T.I.'s song &quot;Live Your Life&quot;. Both songs have similar elements including the lead synthesizers, drum pattern, and violins but in a different key and different chords.\n\nThe music video, directed by Erik White, was shot in Miami and features Maino drinking &quot;Purple Stuff&quot;, a relaxation drink from Funktional Beverages, during an interview sequence.  The music video premiered on MTV Jams March 23, 2009.\n\nThis single is Maino's first to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. It debuted at #54 and then rose to #39 the next week and then fell out of the top fifty a couple weeks later, and then climbed back into the top fifty for another five weeks without surpassing the original peak position. It's currently back in the top fifty. It also has peaked at #10 on the Hot Rap Tracks, #59 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and #46 on the Pop 100. The single is certified gold.\n\nIf Tomorrow Comes... is the first studio album by rapper Maino. The album was released on June 30, 2009 after several delays.\n\nIn 2003, Maino was released from prison after a 10 year sentence for a drug related kidnapping. He founded the independent label Hustle Hard and started to record music. In 2005, he was signed to Universal Records and started recording his debut album Death Before Dishonor. However, Maino was dropped from the label and his album was shelved. Then in 2007, Atlantic Records signed him and took in his Hustle Hard imprint. He released his first single &quot;Hi Hater&quot; in 2008.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2826a3487f1261c57d8ff407ae9c8f176b0c363e","amp;dn":"Maino+feat.+T-Pain+-+All+The+Above","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2826a3487f1261c57d8ff407ae9c8f176b0c363e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,38,163,72,127,18,97,197,125,143,244,7,174,156,143,23,107,12,54,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
