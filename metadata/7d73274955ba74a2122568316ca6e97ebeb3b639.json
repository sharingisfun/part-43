From all corners, politicians, power brokers, and military leaders converge on Coruscant for a crucial summit to restore order, negotiate differences, and determine the future of their unified worlds. But even more critical, and far more uncertain, is the future of the Jedi.\n\nIn a shocking move, Chief of State Natasi Daala orders the arrest of Luke Skywalker for failing to prevent Jacen Solo's turn to the dark side and subsequent reign of terror as a Sith Lord. But it's only the first blow in an anti-Jedi backlash fueled by a hostile government and suspicious public. When Jedi Knight Valin Horn, scion of a politically influential family, suffers a mysterious psychotic break and becomes a dangerous fugitive, the Jedi become the target of a media-driven witch-hunt. Facing conviction on the charges, Luke has only one choice. He must strike a bargain with the calculating Daala-his freedom in exchange for his exile from Coruscant and from the Jedi Order.\n\nNow, though forbidden to intervene in Jedi affairs, Luke is determined to keep grim history from being repeated. With his son, Ben, at his side, Luke sets out to unravel the shocking truth behind Jacen Solo's corruption and downfall. But the secrets he uncovers among the enigmatic Force mystics of the distant world Dorin may bring his questÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and life as he knows itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to a sudden end. And all the while, another Jedi Knight, consumed by the same madness as Valin Horn, is headed for Coruscant on a fearsome mission that could doom the Jedi Order . . . and devastate the entire galaxy. \n\nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv\n&gt;                      &lt;         \n&gt; w w w                &lt;\n&gt;   ExtraTorrent       &lt;\n&gt;               com    &lt;\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d73274955ba74a2122568316ca6e97ebeb3b639","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+%5BFate+of+the+Jedi+1%5D+Outcast+by+Aaron+Allston%5BPDF.Doc.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d73274955ba74a2122568316ca6e97ebeb3b639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,115,39,73,85,186,116,162,18,37,104,49,108,166,233,126,190,179,182,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
