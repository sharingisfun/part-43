Russell Reynolds), his tortured wife (Morgana Shaw), a renegade marchal\n(Jodie Moore) and his posse of cruel Confederate defectors that guard them.\n\nWith history wrapped in superstition, and murders masked by myth, Lady Celestine\nreveals the grisly secret of a dead Spanish Conquistador, a heretic hanged, and\nthe 300-year old Apache legend of an abomination the feeds on innocence.\n\nThis low budget film shot in Texas is destined to be a full, western cult classic.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bab1b453744df3971a4c5da5588eeda68a7f199c","amp;dn":"Shroud.western%2Chorror.mystery%2Ccult.weird.DivX%2CDVD.rip.Reloaded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bab1b453744df3971a4c5da5588eeda68a7f199c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,177,180,83,116,77,243,151,26,76,93,165,88,142,237,166,138,127,25,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
