In fact, Roe's initial pop smash, 1962's chart-topping Sheila, was quite reminiscent of Holly's Peggy Sue, utilizing a very similar throbbing drumbeat and Roe's hiccuping vocal. The singer had previously cut the song for the smaller Judd label before remaking it in superior form for ABC-Paramount. The infectious Everybody -- another hot item the next year -- was waxed in Muscle Shoals at Rick Hall's Fame studios, normally an R&amp;B-oriented facility (it's not widely known that Roe wrote songs for the Tams, a raw-edged soul group from his Atlanta hometown). Once Roe veered off on his squeaky-clean bubblegum tangent, he stuck with it for the rest of the decade. His lighthearted Sweet Pea and Hooray for Hazel burned up the charts in 1966, and he was still at it three years later when he waxed his biggest hit, Dizzy, and Jam Up Jelly Tight.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Sheila\n02.The Folk Singer\n03.Everybody\n04.Come On\n05.Party Girl\n06.Everytime A Bluebird Cries\n07.Sweet Pea\n08.Hooray For Hazel\n09.It's Now Winter's Day\n10.Dottie I Like It\n11.Dizzy\n12.Heather Honey\n13.Jack And Jill\n14.Jam Up And Jelly Tight\n15.Stir It Up And Serve It\n16.Pearl\n17.We Can Make Music\n18.Stagger Lee\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc61ec0124950f504331042ef171d56e169649d6","amp;dn":"Tommy+Roe+-+Greatest+Hits++%281993%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc61ec0124950f504331042ef171d56e169649d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,97,236,1,36,149,15,80,67,49,4,46,241,113,213,110,22,150,73,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
