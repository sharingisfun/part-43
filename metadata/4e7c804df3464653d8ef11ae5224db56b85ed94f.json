The project took root in 2007, when the two began composing songs to accompany one of Lindhome's short films, Imaginary Larry. Both actresses proved to be fairly adept musicians -- Lindhome (aka &quot;Garfunkel&quot;) played guitar, while Micucci (aka &quot;Oates&quot;) had studied classical piano as a child -- and the resulting music was light, melodic, and humorous. The two continued writing songs after completing the Imaginary Larry project, touching upon such time-honored subjects as the arrogance of pregnant women and the mating habits of ducks in the process. Their visibility increased when &quot;Fuck You&quot; was featured in an episode of Scrubs (albeit with a revised, expletive-free refrain) in February 2009, and they issued their first recording, Music Songs, later that year. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tVariable Bit Rate -V 2 (Standard)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tComedy\nLabel:\t\t\tNo One Buys Records\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.You, Me And Steve\n02.Weed Card\n03.Pregnant Woman Are Smug\n04.Gay Boyfriend\n05.Fuck You\n06.Sex With Ducks\n07.This Party Took A Turn For The Douche\n08.Running With Chicken\n09.One Night Stand\n10.Places To Rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                      ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e7c804df3464653d8ef11ae5224db56b85ed94f","amp;dn":"Garfunkel+%26+Oates+-+All+Over+Your+Face+%282011%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e7c804df3464653d8ef11ae5224db56b85ed94f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,124,128,77,243,70,70,83,216,239,17,174,82,36,219,86,184,94,217,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
