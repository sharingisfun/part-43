SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶llscher has the knack of knowing how far to take each song--teasing out the pathos in &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, while respecting the simple yet sublime melodic writing of &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot;. Per Arne Glorvigen joins him on bandoneon for three tango transformations, including a suitably ominous &quot;Come Together&quot;, complete with guitar percussives. For many the fifth Beatle, George Martin's roots in the world of 1950s light music are vividly evoked in his Three American Sketches. &quot;Westward, Look!&quot; engages with its catchy rhythmic syncopation, while &quot;New York, New York&quot; has a breeziness recalling classic Dave Brubeck. Finally, there' a seven-song suite arranged by Cuban Leo Brouwer, guitar composer second to none. Highlights include a wistful and harmonically sumptuous &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot;, and the elaborate fantasy conjured from &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;. Crisply and atmospherically recorded.\nRichard Whitehouse\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d66a1c792ef2dc30b7de2006c08da88f3fc8004","amp;dn":"Goran+Sollscher+%28Beatles%29+-+From+Yesterday+to+Penny+Lane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d66a1c792ef2dc30b7de2006c08da88f3fc8004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,102,161,199,146,239,45,195,11,125,226,0,108,8,218,136,243,252,128,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
