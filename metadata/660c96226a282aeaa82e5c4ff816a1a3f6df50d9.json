You can find the manfacture date on the bottom of the console on the sticker in fine print just look for it. \n\n\nGame Description:\n\nGet ready for a new and improved kick in Marvel Vs. Capcom 2 for dc edited with Michael Jackson's hit songs, and other features. Fun if your looking for something a little different. \n\nCOVER ART AND AUDIO EDITED by z\nCHARACTER ART EDITED by DJ FAT and Silent H\n\nAll songs have been replaced with various hits by none other than Michael Jackson, and have been edited to loop as seemlessly as possible. Surely (especially) if you get wrapped up in the fast action, you probably won't even notice when songs repeat! I feel there isn't even any need to spoil which tracks are in the game, but there's bound to be at least a few of your favorites!\n\nAll buttons (with the exception of LP) have had their colors edited. Even projectiles and other related particle effects match the character's color theme.\n\n(Description and game downloaded from Underground-gamer.com, permission to upload on other torrent sites was given by original uploader.)\n\n\nCheck out my other great torrent for Ecco link below.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5052357/[DC]_Ecco_The_Dolphin_[Ntsc]_[Self-boot]_[CDI]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5052357/[DC]_Ecco_The_Dolphin_[Ntsc]_[Self-boot]_[CDI]&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGame Pics included.\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% or Discjuggler (Both included in download).\n\nBest to burn at 4x or slowest.\n\nSet Burn Settings to Raw/Dao for Alcohol 120% or Raw write Mode 2 2352 CD-DA for Discjuggler, or Mode 1 2048 Raw Write if that doesn't work for discjuggler.\n\nAny DC Games that you burn make sure you allow overburning option in Alcohol or discjuggler, if your burner supports it.\n\nBurn at slowest speed possible for compatibility.\n\nUse Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD-R Media for best quality.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions, please post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660c96226a282aeaa82e5c4ff816a1a3f6df50d9","amp;dn":"%5BDC%5D+Marvel+Vs.+Capcom+2+MJ+Edition+%5BNtsc%5D+%5BSB%5D+%5BCDI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660c96226a282aeaa82e5c4ff816a1a3f6df50d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,12,150,34,106,40,42,234,168,46,92,79,248,22,161,163,246,223,80,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
