Then release the power button and continue holding the home button for another 10 seconds until you see your phone enter recovery mode or hear the connection sound.\n\nStep 2\n\nOn iTunes, hold Shift and click on Restore. Open the 3.1.2 IPSW file you downloaded earlier. As it completes, you will get an error. THIS IS NORMAL!!\n\nStep 3\n\nOpen blackra1n. If it tells you that a file called &quot;asl.dll&quot; is missing, it will not work, so quit blackra1n and open blackbreeze. Follow the easy instructions to fix blackra1n. Then open the newly-made version, usually called &quot;blackra1n-fixed.exe&quot;.\n\nStep 4\n\nUse blackra1n to jailbreak your iPhone. When it has finished, notice you won't have a Carrier. Don't worry about this, it gets fixed.\n\nStep 5\n\nHold the power button and home button for ten seconds while the iPhone is turned off and connected to your computer. Then release the power button and continue holding the home button for another 10 seconds until you see your phone enter recovery mode or hear the connection sound.\n\nStep 6\n\nOn iTunes, hold Shift and click on Restore. Open the 3.1.3 IPSW file you downloaded earlier. It will restore to the 3.1.3 firmware. You will notice your Carrier has returned.\n\nStep 7\n\nRestore your iPhone to the backup you made earlier. When it has reinstalled all your data, photos, contacts etc. then proceed to the next step.\n\nStep 8\n\nOpen redsn0w. It will ask for the IPSW of your currently installed firmware. Do not select the 3.1.3 IPSW as it will not work, instead open the 3.1.2 IPSW. Let it jailbreak your iPhone.\n\nThen after all that is done, you SHOULD be on 3.1.3 firmware with the modem firmware still at 5.12.01 AND you can call and text Smile\n\nS'good!!\n\n=p0wersurge=","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b02d26491162e37ee7df5b2d42b136447676938e","amp;dn":"iJailbreak+Kit+for+iPhone+3G+and+3Gs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b02d26491162e37ee7df5b2d42b136447676938e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,45,38,73,17,98,227,126,231,223,91,45,66,177,54,68,118,118,147,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
