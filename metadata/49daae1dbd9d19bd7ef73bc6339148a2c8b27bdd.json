Are you a Miserable Man?  Then\n      this is the show you need to listen to.  You're not alone.\n\n      Discussions regarding Howard's recent tirade against the show's plug\n      habit which was mostly directed at Bob Levy.  The guys have their say\n      on what they think is and isn't proper plugging behavior.  Great Show.\n      Lisa Lampanelli and her boyfriend Joey Big Balls stop by to promote\n      her new book, &quot;Chocolate Please&quot;.\n\n\n                            ***[ATTENTION]***\n       Miserable Men is a great show!!!  I realized it deserves a better\n       sound quality and more seeders.  It's fucking hilarious and it is\n       even better now that they got the 4 hour time slot.  It's definitely \n       the best show behind Howard and maybe Bubba. If you have not heard\n       or originally disliked this show I really suggest you download this. \n\n                       DOWNLOAD AND SEED THIS SHOW!\n      \n                         .syo-                          .                  \n                         dMMMMo+++ooo++yy+`          /yNh`                 \n                        /MMMMM//     `hmhNo        +mMMN`   - `/ -dN.      \n                        hMMMMMMNy`    +Md:      `/dMMMMd    mdmhoMMM-      \n         .`   .        .MMMMMMMMM+     -h/     .dMMMMMMMd/` -//dMMMMy:     \n        MMMd-+M:       /MMMMddMMMo  s:   /s:  -MMMMMMMMMMMMNdhmMMMMMy/     \n        yMMMMhMd+:+-   yMMMMoyMMMo  mMs`   :y: sMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMdyMM:`     \n        `NMMMd:+mMMMh  mMMMM:dNMMo  dMMm:    +h:hMMMMMMyyhmMMMNo`dMM.      \n       `dhMMMMhMMMMMMs NMMMMNMs:s-  oMMMMy`   `yN+NMMMMN.  `:-`  dMM/hN`   \n        /mdMMMMMMMMMMN/MMMMMMMN.    `/oshd+     ymoNMMMMN:       dMMMMh.   \n         :.NMMMMMNhMMMMMMMMMMMMm.               yo+`dMMMMN-      dMMNs+/   \n           -mMMMh. sMMMMMMMNMMMM-            .+hs   `hMMMMd     `NMhs+     \n             .-`    /NMMMMM+hMMMNdhyo/////oymN+`     `hMms`      ``        \n                     `/yyyo dMMMMMMMMMMMMMMm+          `                   \n                             .:/+shhhhhyo/`                                \n                                                                      \n\n                           wushdishmeen productions\n\n   Lineage: Sirius Connect &gt; ProTools &gt; mp3DirectCut &gt; 80kbps 44KHz .mp3\n                       Edited For The True Stern Fan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49daae1dbd9d19bd7ef73bc6339148a2c8b27bdd","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+-+Miserable+Men+-+80kbps+-+09+27+2009-CF+%5Bwdm%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49daae1dbd9d19bd7ef73bc6339148a2c8b27bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,218,174,29,189,157,25,189,126,247,59,198,51,145,72,162,200,178,123,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
