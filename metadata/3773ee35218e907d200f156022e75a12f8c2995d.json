Far away more realistic than a regular pan-pot (level only).\nIt obviously works on stereo channels only, but you can route mono signals to stereo mixing channels in most of programs.\nI also added the posibility to name instances to get a clear workflow using multiple instances.\nFor install just paste the panning.dll file in to your vst folder\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3773ee35218e907d200f156022e75a12f8c2995d","amp;dn":"Panning+audio+vst","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3773ee35218e907d200f156022e75a12f8c2995d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,115,238,53,33,142,144,125,32,15,21,96,34,231,90,18,248,194,153,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
