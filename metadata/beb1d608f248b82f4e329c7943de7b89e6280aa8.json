It is their only album without Geri Halliwell (who reunited with the Spice Girls in 2007 for their Greatest Hits release). The album saw a huge drop in sales compared to their first two albums, but it was also because of lack of promotion especially in the United States, where most of their previous albums were sold. It was at this point in time when &quot;Spice Mania&quot; began to fade. Despite everything that happened, Forever managed to sell 3 million copies worldwide and was able to peak at number two in the United Kingdom behind Westlife's Coast to Coast.\t\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Holler\n[02] Tell Me Why\n[03] Let Love Lead The Way\n[04] Right Back At Ya\n[05] Groove With Me\n[06] Wasting My Time\n[07] Weekend Love\n[08] Time Goes By\n[09] If You Wanna Have Some Fun\n[10] Oxygen\n[11] Goodbye \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:49m:33s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 121mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 06 November 2000\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodbye [CDS] - Spice Girls [1998]\n\t\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Goodbye [Radio Edit]\n[02] Christmas Wrapping\n[03] Goodbye (Orchestral Mix)\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:12m:54s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 32mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 14 December 1998 [UK] 15 December 1998 [US]\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Virgin Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.thespicegirls.com \n\t\t\t- http://www.thespicegirlsgreatesthits.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/spicegirls\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb1d608f248b82f4e329c7943de7b89e6280aa8","amp;dn":"%5B2000%5D+Forever+-+Spice+Girls+-+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb1d608f248b82f4e329c7943de7b89e6280aa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,177,214,8,242,72,184,47,78,50,156,121,67,222,123,137,230,40,10,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
