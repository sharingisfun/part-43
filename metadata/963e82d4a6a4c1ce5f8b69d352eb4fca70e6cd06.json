The opium poppy is the raw material for heroin, fueling a vast criminal trade larger than the economies of many countries.\n\nRaw Opium is a journey around the world and through time, where conflicting forces do battle over the narcotic sap of the opium poppy. From an opium master in southeast Asia to a UN drug enforcement officer on the border of Afghanistan hunting down the smugglers of central Asia; from a former Indian government Drug Czar and opium farmer to a crusading Vancouver doctor and Portuguese street worker who daily confront the realities of drug addiction.\n\nWe see how this flower has played, and continues to play, a pivotal role - not just in the lives of people who grow, manufacture and use it - but also in the increasingly tense sphere of international relations. In the process, our assumptions about addiction and the War on Drugs are challenged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:963e82d4a6a4c1ce5f8b69d352eb4fca70e6cd06","amp;dn":"Kensington.Raw.Opium.1of2.DVB.x264.AC3.MVGroup.Forum.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"963e82d4a6a4c1ce5f8b69d352eb4fca70e6cd06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,62,130,212,166,164,193,206,95,139,105,211,82,235,79,202,112,230,205,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
