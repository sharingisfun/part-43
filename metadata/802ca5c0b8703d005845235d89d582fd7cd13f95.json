In an effort to attract youthful audiences growing increasingly accustomed to American and French big-screen imports, Nikkatsu began producing action potboilers (mukokuseki akushun, or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œborderless actionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) that incorporated elements of the western, comedy, gangster, and teen-rebel genres. This bruised and bloody collection represents a standout cross section of what Nikkatsu had to offer, from such prominent, stylistically daring directors as Seijun Suzuki, Toshio Masuda, and Takashi Nomura.\n\nI Am Waiting | Directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara | Japan | 1957\n\nIn Koreyoshi KuraharaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s directorial debut, rebel matinee idol Yujiro Ishihara (fresh off the sensational Crazed Fruit) stars as a restaurant manager and former boxer who saves a beautiful, suicidal club hostess (Mie Kitahara) trying to escape the clutches of her gangster employer. Featuring expressionist lighting and bold camera work, this was one of NikkatsuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early successes.\n\n91 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nJapanese\n1.37 GB XviD / AC-3\nEnglish Subtitles (SRT)\n\nRusty Knife | Directed by Toshio Masuda | Japan | 1958\n\nRusty Knife was the first smash for director Toshio Masuda, who would go on to become one of Japanese cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s major hit makers. In the film, Yujiro Ishihara and fellow top Nikkatsu star Akira Kobayashi play former hoodlums trying to leave behind a life of crime, but their past comes back to haunt them when the authorities seek them out as murder witnesses.\n\n90 minutes\nBlack and White\n2.35:1\nJapanese\n1.37 GB XviD / AC-3\nEnglish Subtitles (SRT)\n\nTake Aim at the Police Van | Directed by Seijun Suzuki | Japan | 1960\n\nAt the beginning of Seijun SuzukiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s taut and twisty whodunit, a prison truck is attacked and a convict inside murdered. The penitentiary guard on duty, Daijiro (Michitaro Mizushima), is accused of negligence and suspended, only to take it upon himself to track down the killers.\n\n84 minutes\nBlack and White\n2.45:1\nJapanese\n1.37 GB XviD / AC-3\nEnglish Subtitles (SRT)\n\nCruel Gun Story | Directed by Takumi Furukawa | Japan | 1964\n\nFresh out of the slammer, Togawa (Branded to KillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rough-and-ready Joe Shishido) has no chance to go straight because he is immediately coerced by a wealthy mob boss into organizing a heist on an armored car carrying racetrack receipts. After assembling a ragtag bunch to carry out the robbery, Togawa learns that all is not what it seems in Takumi FurukawaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s thriller. Cue the double (and triple) crosses!\n\n91 minutes\nBlack and White\n2.45:1\nJapanese\n1.37 GB XviD / AC-3\nEnglish Subtitles (SRT)\n\nA Colt Is My Passport | Takashi Nomura | Japan | 1967\n\nOne of Japanese cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s supreme emulations of American noir, Takashi NomuraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Colt Is My Passport is a down-and-dirty but gorgeously photographed yakuza film starring Joe Shishido as a hard-boiled hit man caught between rival gangs. Featuring an incredible, spaghetti-western-style soundtrack and brimming with formal experimentation, this is Nikkatsu at its finest.\n\n84 minutes\nBlack and White\n2.35:1\nJapanese\n1.37 GB XviD / AC-3\nEnglish Subtitles (SRT)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:802ca5c0b8703d005845235d89d582fd7cd13f95","amp;dn":"Nikkatsu.Noir.1957-1967.CRITERION.DVDRip.XviD-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"802ca5c0b8703d005845235d89d582fd7cd13f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,44,165,192,184,112,61,0,88,69,35,93,137,213,130,253,124,209,63,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
