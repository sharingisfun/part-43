This year the prize was awarded to journalist and left-wing provocateur John Pilger. As conflicts rage around the globe, Pilger argues that in Australia we have largely remained silent on injustices in the Middle East, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He has also called for Australians to confront the issues facing the Aboriginal communities and the policies of the government in relation to boat people.\n\nJohn Pilger was the recipient of the 2009 Sydney Peace Prize. He is an award winning journalist, author and film-maker. His articles have been published in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Guardian, NY and LA Times and he is a two time winner of British Journalist of the Year.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.archive.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.archive.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.c-spanarchives.org/person/1336&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.c-spanarchives.org/person/1336&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n...check out my &quot;Best of Noam Chomsky&quot; Video if u want: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vimeo.com/7344978&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vimeo.com/7344978&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n..i wish u aLL the best and i hope that you will seed this torrent a little bit..\n\n..theArchit3kt..\n\nvisit my site on Vimeo if u want: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vimeo.com/nobrand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vimeo.com/nobrand&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso you can take a look at all my torrents on the &quot;SuperBayForum&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=62897&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=62897&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n!! keep torrents alive !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8e841cace3d01b2fa38445be9c0abbdf7ca509","amp;dn":"John+Pilger+-+Sydney+Peace+Prize+-+November+20%2C+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf8e841cace3d01b2fa38445be9c0abbdf7ca509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,142,132,28,172,227,208,27,47,163,132,69,190,156,10,187,223,124,165,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
