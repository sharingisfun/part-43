Randle P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a free-spirited con with lightning in his veins and glib on his tongue, fakes insanity and moves in with what he calls the &quot;nuts.&quot; Immediately, his contagious sense of disorder runs up against numbing routine. No way should guys pickled on sedatives shuffle around in bathrobes when the World Series is on. This means war! On one side is McMurphy. On the other is soft-spoken Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), among the most coldly monstrous villains in film history. At stake is the fate of every patient on the ward.\nGenre: Drama\nLanguage: English\n\nCast:\nMichael Berryman ... Ellis\nPeter Brocco ... Col. Matterson\nDean R. Brooks ...
