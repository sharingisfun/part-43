Again (1996)\n              ----------------------------------------\n\nSolid Horror Film With Michael Gross At The Helm.\n\nThis film is a sequel to the film Sometimes They Come Back (1991) based on the Stephen King novel of the same name.\n\nThis film stars veteran actor Michael Gross and an added bonus: the gorgeous beauty Hilary Swank. Michael Gross isn't an imbecile to sign on for a film whose script isn't good. He thoroughly commands this film and his expressions throughout the film are believable.\n\nHilary Swank on the other hand is the plot device on which the film hinges on. She is rightfully chosen for the film because of her seductive looks.\n\nThe villain of the film is played by the awesome Alexis Arquette.\n\nPlot: Psychologist Jon Porter (Michael Gross) learns that his mother has just mysteriously fallen to her death. Jon and his teenage daughter Michelle (Hilary Swank) return to Jon's hometown of Glenrock for his mother's funeral. Once there, painful memories return. Thirty years earlier, when Jon was a child, he witnessed the brutal murder of his older sister Lisa (Leslie Danon), who was stabbed to death in a cave by a thug named Tony Reno (Alexis Arquette) and his two friends Vinnie (Bojesse Christopher) and Sean (Glen Beauden). But Jon managed to throw an electrical wire into a puddle of bloody water they were standing in, killing all three of them.\n\nMichelle becomes friends with mentally retarded gardener Steve (Gabriel Dell Jr.), as well as two girls, boy-crazy Maria (Jennifer Aspen), and Maria's psychic best friend, Jules (Jennifer Elise Cox), who used to clean her grandmother's house. The night after the funeral, they invite Michelle to go to the dinner with them, saying they would like to get to know her before she goes home for her 18th birthday. At the dinner, the girls are greeted by a boy who looks a lot like Tony Reno, even with the same name. While Maria develops a crush on him, he seems to be attracted to Michelle. He gives Michelle an old wristwatch as an early birthday present, then leaves. Maria and Jules are then murdered.\n\nMeanwhile, Jon is pestered by Father Archer Roberts (W. Morgan Sheppard), a priest he came to when Lisa was murdered. He tells Jon his mother's death was not an accident.\n\nVerdict: An excellent sequel, and a different take to the original.
