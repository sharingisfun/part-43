There are minor cuts, a couple of the variations are edited out.\n\nReview\n\nA nice performance, though I admit I tend to vastly prefer live performances than those undertaken in the studio, \nwhich tend to be a bit &quot;studio bound&quot; as it were, and this is.\n\nThe production is very attractive, and reads well on camera. \nThere are a few cuts, the peasant PDD is not in fact complete, \na couple of the variations are edited out, and there are minor cuts here and there in many of the numbers. \nRecorded sound is acceptable, not terribly vivid. \nThe principles all do well, perhaps a mild want of bravura here and there, \nand the lifts in act Two are not ideally fluid.\n\nGiselle's expiration by weakness of constitution dates to the ballet's creation, \nand while one will occasionally see a performance in which she stabs herself with Albrecht's sword, \nor some such reference in a synopsis, that is a latter-day invention, and is rarely utilized. \nThe original choreographer's work has been filtered through Pepita and others, \nand it is quite possible the change came about as a more warts-and-all Russian response to French Romanticism.\nGiselle's mother continually expresses concern that her daughter not overdo,\nfor fear of falling dead and becoming a Wili. Giselle is often seen to tire during the first peasant ensemble. \nHer death by betrayal imposed upon a fragile soul is much more in keeping with the ethos of the ballet's place \nin composition than the more veristic act of suicide.\n\nThe camera work is excellent, and the direction for the screen is generally well done. The sound is mono only.\n\nKaren Kain - Giselle\nFrank Augustyn - Albrecht\nAnne Ditchburn - Princess Bathilde\nJacques Gorrisson - Wilfred\n\nHazaros Surmeyan - Hilarion\nNadia Potts - Queen of the Wilis\nVictoria Bertram - Berthe\nCharles Kirby - Duke of Courland\n\nDirector: Norman Campbell\n\nChoreography: Peter Wright after Jean Coralli, Jules Perrot, and Marius Petipa\nThe National Ballet of Canada\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 \nRun Time: 1:24 \nchapters: 15\nresolution: 640x480\nVideo Codec: AVC/h.264\nAudio Codec: AAC \nEncoder handbrake: 0.9.5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e487f9c27cb6e4f9b7f88f581a7bcd8e19fb2776","amp;dn":"Giselle-Canada+ballet-1976%5BiPod+H264+DVDrip%5D%28with+chapters%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e487f9c27cb6e4f9b7f88f581a7bcd8e19fb2776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,135,249,194,124,182,228,249,183,248,143,88,26,123,205,142,25,251,39,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
