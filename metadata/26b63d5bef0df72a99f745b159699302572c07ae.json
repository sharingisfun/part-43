Larry, Moe, and Curly-Joe are friends of a young scientist, Schuyler Davis, who has created a time machine. Together with Schuyler's girlfriend, Diane, they are all transported back to ancient Ithaca which is ruled by the tyrannical King Odius. The lecherous king promptly takes a liking to Diane and banishes Schuyler and The Stooges to the galleys. When they manage to escape, they begin promoting Schuyler as &quot;Hercules&quot; at local gladiatorial combats - until the real Hercules shows up. But, with their unique &quot;charm,&quot; The Stooges convince Hercules to help them rescue Diane.\n\nMoe Howard\nLarry Fine\nJoe DeRita (Curly Joe)\n\n\n\nFor those of you who think I must have compressed it, I didn't. I ripped this from the DVD and did not compress it. The retail DVD is a single layer disk and is this size.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b63d5bef0df72a99f745b159699302572c07ae","amp;dn":"The+Three+Stooges+Meet+Hercules","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b63d5bef0df72a99f745b159699302572c07ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,182,61,91,239,13,247,42,153,247,69,177,89,105,147,2,87,44,7,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
