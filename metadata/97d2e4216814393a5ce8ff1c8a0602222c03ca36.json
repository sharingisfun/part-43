The shoulder pad helped define the silhouette and was\nreintroduced in cut foam versions, especially in well-cut suits reminiscent of the WWII era.\nBefore too long, these masculinized shapes were adopted by women seeking success in the\ncorporate world and became an icon of women's attempts to smash the glass ceiling, a\nmission that was added by their notable appearance in the TV series Dynasty.\n\n\nAs the decade wore on, shoulder pads became the defining fashion statement of the era,\nknown as power dressing and bestowing the perception of status and position onto those\nwho wore them. They became both larger and more ubiquitous~every garment from the\nbrassiere upwards would come with its own set of shoulder pads. To prevent excessive\nshoulder padding, velcro was sewn onto the pads so that the wearer could choose how many\nsets to wear. By the end of the era, some shoulder pads were the size of dinner plates. It was\ninevitable that as the cycle of fashion turned\n\nLeg warmers are coverings for the lower legs, similar to socks but thicker and generally\nfootless. Leg warmers were originally dancewear worn by ballet and other classic dancers.\nLeg warmers are worn by dancers in keep warm the leg muscles and to prevent cramped and\ninjured muscles.\nConstruction\n\nTraditionally knitted from pure wool, leg warmers are more typically made of cotton, synthetic\nfibers, or both. Some are made of other materials, such as chenille. Other leg warmers are\nmade of wool, camel hair and Old English Sheep Dog hair.\n\nLeg warmers can vary in length, though not in width, due to the material's stretchiness. They\nare commonly worn to just below the knee, though many dancers prefer it to extend to cover\nthe lower parts of the thigh. Some leg warmers cover the entire foot; these warmers usually\nhave a pad that grips the floor so the dancer does not slip - however this has been known to\ncause career-ending injury. Some leg warmers are particularly short and made of thinner\nmaterial; these are also known as 'ankle warmers'.\n\nRay-Ban is a high end manufacturer of sunglasses, founded in 1937 by Bausch &amp; Lomb.\nThey were introduced for the United States Army Air Corps. In 1999, Bausch &amp; Lomb sold the\nbrand to the Italian Luxottica Group\n\nRay-Bans were created in 1937. Some years earlier, Lieutenant John MacCready returned\nfrom a balloon flying adventure and complained that the sun had permanently damaged his\neyes. He contacted Bausch &amp; Lomb asking them to create sunglasses that would provide\nprotection and also look elegant. On May 7, 1937, Bausch &amp; Lomb took out the patent.The\nprototype, known as Anti-Glare, had an extremely light frame weighing 150 grams. They were\nmade of gold-plated metal with green lenses made of mineral glass to filter out infrared and\nultraviolet rays. Pilots in the United States Army Air Corps immediately adopted the\nsunglasses.The Ray-Ban Aviator became a well-known style of sunglasses when General\nDouglas MacArthur landed on the beach in the Philippines in World War II, and\nphotographers snapped several pictures of him wearing them.\n\nDenim is a rugged cotton twill textile, in which the weft passes under two [twi- &quot;double&quot;] or\nmore warp threads. This produces the familiar diagonal ribbing identifiable on the reverse of\nthe fabric, which distinguishes denim from cotton duck. Denim has been in American usage\nsince the late 18th century.The word comes from the name of a sturdy fabric called serge,\noriginally made in NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®mes, France, by the AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© family. Originally called serge de NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â®mes, the\nname was soon shortened to denim.Denim was traditionally colored blue with indigo dye to\nmake blue &quot;jeans&quot;, though &quot;jean&quot; then denoted a different, lighter cotton textile; the\ncontemporary use of jean comes from the French word for Genoa, Italy [Genes], where the\nfirst denim trousers were made.\n\n\n[Disc 1]\n\n  01.
