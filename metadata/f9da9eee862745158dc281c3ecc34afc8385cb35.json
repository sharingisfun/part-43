Equally indebted to traditional pioneers of Delta-style country blues like Leadbelly and Blind Lemon Jefferson as well as more exploratory visionaries like Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder, Phelps sings with dusty wisdom and plays like a master.\n\nLead Me On opens with the traditional gospel tune &quot;I've Been Converted&quot; but focuses almost exclusively on magnificent originals from then on.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9da9eee862745158dc281c3ecc34afc8385cb35","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Kelly+Joe+Phelps+-+Lead+Me+On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9da9eee862745158dc281c3ecc34afc8385cb35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,218,158,238,134,39,69,21,141,194,129,195,236,195,74,252,131,133,203,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
