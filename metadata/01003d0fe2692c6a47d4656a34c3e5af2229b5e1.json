Shelley started writing Frankenstein when she was 18 and finished when she was 19. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. \n\nShelley's name appears on the second edition, published in 1831. The title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. \n\nIn popular culture, people have tended incorrectly to refer to the Creature as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the expansion of modern man in the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. \n\nThe story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films. It is often considered the first fully realized science fiction novel due to its pointed, if gruesome, focus on playing God by creating life from dead flesh.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01003d0fe2692c6a47d4656a34c3e5af2229b5e1","amp;dn":"Mary+Shelley+-+Frankenstein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01003d0fe2692c6a47d4656a34c3e5af2229b5e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,0,61,15,226,105,44,106,71,212,101,106,52,195,229,175,34,41,181,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
