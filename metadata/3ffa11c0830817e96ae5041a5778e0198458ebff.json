I know all of the obstacles and problems that are usually run into when getting to know this phenomenon, and have tried to protect future practitioners from them in this book.\n\nThis guidebook was not created for those who prefer light, empty reading. It is for those who would like to learn something. It contains no speculations or stories, only dry, hard facts and techniques in combination with a completely pragmatic approach and clear procedures for action. They have all been successfully verified by a vast number of practitioners that often had no prior experience. In order to achieve the same result, it is only necessary to read through each section thoroughly and complete the assignments.\n\nThe book is beneficial not only for beginners, but also for those who already know what it feels like to have an out-of-body encounter and have a certain amount of experience, as this guidebook is devoted not only to entering the state, but also equally dedicated to controlling it.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, there is nothing difficult about this phenomenon if one tries to attain it with regular and right effort. On average, results are reached in less than a week if attempts are made every day. More often than not, the techniques work in literally a couple of attempts.\n\nTable of Contents:\nPart 1\nEntering the Phase State\nChapter 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ General Background\nChapter 2 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Indirect Techniques\nChapter 3 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Direct Techniques\nChapter 4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Becoming Conscious While Dreaming\nChapter 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Non-autonomous Methods\nPart II\nManaging the Out-of-Body Experience\nChapter 6 - Deepening\nChapter 7 - Maintaining\nChapter 8 - Primary skills\nChapter 9 - Translocation and Finding Objects\nChapter 10 - Application\nPart III\nAuxiliary Information\nChapter 11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Useful Tips\nChapter 12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ PractitionersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Experiences\nChapter 13 - Putting a Face on the Phenomenon\nChapter 14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Final Test\nAppendix.........214","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ffa11c0830817e96ae5041a5778e0198458ebff","amp;dn":"School+of+Out-of-Body+Travel+by+Michael+RADUGA.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ffa11c0830817e96ae5041a5778e0198458ebff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,250,17,192,131,8,23,233,106,229,4,26,87,120,224,25,132,88,235,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
