By the time of their ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Curtains FallingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ LP (1968) also Dylan! was amongst other noticeable influences (on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGraveyard ParadiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ : the singing, style of song, lyrics, or on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwake up, JohnnyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Several tracks are soft ballads on the edge of beat, sometimes hanging onto early to mid 60s mainstream pop, never the less in an acceptable charming way, without an overwhelming effect.
