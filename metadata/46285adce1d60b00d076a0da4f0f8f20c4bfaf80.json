(Verbatim recommended)\n\n\nNote: No Ps2 Backup disc/game or Copy will work unless your Ps2 Console is modded\n      or if you use Swap Magic.\n\n     \nYou could try the homebrew exploit to (Free Mc Boot - Also known as soft modding for ps2), if your ps2 system isn't hard modded with a chip or if Swap Magic isn't working as a last resort. There are ps2 emulators but its not 100% &amp; the quality isn't as good as playing your game on your ps2 console.\n\nIf your using swap magic and don't have a flip top, you'll need to first\nremove the front cover of the disc tray for use of the slide card.\n\nAlso swap magic should have a cd loader to boot cd type ps2 games.\n\nHere's a link for how to remove the front cover...\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modchipstore.com/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&amp;_a=viewarticle&amp;kbarticleid=49&amp;nav=0,2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd here's some links on using the slide tool to open the tray to swap in your ps2 copy or backup game.\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.swapmagic3.com/slide-tool/Instructions.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/340944&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/15105&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThose that don't have a modded Ps2 Here's a few links for Free MC Boot &amp; how to use it to soft mod your ps2 so you can be able to play burned games.

Verbatim or Tayio yuden is preferred.\n\nNote: If fmcb isn't working and your Ps2 isn't Modded, Try Swap Magic to load the game.\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nThe first Harvest Moon game for the PS2 takes a little deviance from all the other games in the series. The goal this time around is to save your town from being turned into a resort next year. The game focuses more on relationships than making money - which is the goal in all other Harvest Moon games to date. You still are running a farm and must succeed in the life of a farmer, but the actual gameplay rewards those who interact with the townspeople over those who just work the fields.\n\n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120%, (Included in download).  \n\nSet datatype to Playstation 2 (Write Method Raw/Dao) and Burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD-R Media, or if other media isn't working.\n\n(No CD-RW Media will not work only CD-R will).\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46285adce1d60b00d076a0da4f0f8f20c4bfaf80","amp;dn":"Harvest+Moon+-+Save+The+Homeland+%5BNtsc%5D%2C+Ps2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46285adce1d60b00d076a0da4f0f8f20c4bfaf80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,40,90,220,225,214,11,0,208,118,160,218,79,15,143,32,196,191,175,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
