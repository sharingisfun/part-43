After his shock defeat at the hands of Crash Bandicoot, the mad doctor was lucky enough to crash into a planet possessing a powerful emphasis upon balance in the solar system. After running several tests on the planet's crystals, Dr. Neo Cortex came to the conclusion that these remarkably powered crystals were responsible for the balance and the alignment of the planets.\n\nUnfortunately, some of these crystals were missing, and the solar system is in a desperate state of despair. Knowing this, Dr. Neo Cortex built the Cortex Vortex, a machine that in theory is meant to save the world. Unfortunately to complete the Cortex Vortex, Dr. Neo Cortex has sinisterly called upon the services of Crash Bandicoot to help him gain all twenty-five crystals.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a54ab75e7ffde18bf7b08e23ab04a4bbe24b32","amp;dn":"Crash+Bandicoot+2%3A+Cortex+Strikes+Back+Image+File+PSX+Psone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a54ab75e7ffde18bf7b08e23ab04a4bbe24b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,165,74,183,94,127,253,225,139,247,176,142,35,171,4,164,187,226,75,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
