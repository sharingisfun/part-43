It was released in the United Kingdom on 16 November 1985 by Epic Records and in the United States on 21 December 1985 by Portrait Records.\n \nThe major hits from this album were &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot; and &quot;Never as Good as the First Time&quot;, which reached number five and number twenty on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, respectively. Also, &quot;Is It a Crime&quot; was released as a single. While not as initially successful as their debut album, Diamond Life, Promise became the band's first album to top the albums chart in both the United Kingdom and the United States, helped by an appearance at Live Aid and a cameo in the film Absolute Beginners.\n \nThe title Promise comes from a letter from Sade Adu's father where he refers to the &quot;promise of hope&quot; to recover from cancer.\n\nSade are an English R&amp;B band that formed in 1983. The band's music features elements of R&amp;B, soul, jazz, funk and soft rock.
