Noir: The City as Character\n\nAlain Silver, James Ursini \n\nPublisher: Santa Monica Press | 2005-10-28 | ISBN: 1595800069 | PDF | 176 pages | 19.08 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilm buffs explore the world of noir cinema in a Los Angeles context with this guide to noir films and their California settings. \n\nThis book illustrates how these films use L.A.'s diverse cityscape and architecture to convey a unique vision of urban corruption and existential fatalism, in both the gritty downtown area and the outlying affluent communities like Malibu and Beverly Hills. \n\n\nDozens of noir and neo-noir films are featured including classics such as Double Indemnity, Kiss Me Deadly, Sunset Boulevard, and Touch of Evil and more recent films such as Mulholland Drive and Pulp Fiction. More than 150 photographsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½many never before publishedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½further illustrate the rich and constantly changing backdrop of these movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb91413e75acf70c30963ce8cbd7d453b459f470","amp;dn":"L.A.+Noir%3A+The+City+as+Character","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb91413e75acf70c30963ce8cbd7d453b459f470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,145,65,62,117,172,247,12,48,150,60,232,203,215,212,83,180,89,244,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
