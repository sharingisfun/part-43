Sinatra was one of the greatest voices of his--or any--generation, and for the most part, these songs are some of Old Blue Eyes' finest works: among the best are &quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, &quot;Lady Is a Tramp&quot; and &quot;I Get a Kick out of You&quot;.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] My Way\n[02] Strangers In The Night\n[03] New York, New York\n[04] I Get A Kick Out Of You\n[05] Somethin' Stupid\t\t- With Nancy Sinatra\n[06] Moon River\n[07] What Now My Love\n[08] Summer Love\n[09] For Once In My Life\n[10] Love And Marriage\n[11] They Can't Take That Away From Me\n[12] My Kind Of Town\n[13] Fly Me To The Moon\t\t- With Count Basie And His Orchestra\n[14] I've Got You Under My Skin\n[15] The Best Is Yet To Come\t- With Count Basie And His Orchestra\n[16] It Was A Very Good Year\n[17] Come Fly With Me\n[18] That's Life\n[19] The Girl From Ipanema\t\t- With Antonio Carlos Jobim\n[20] The Lady Is A Tramp\t\t- With Woody Herman &amp; Young Thundering Herd\n[21] Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\n[22] Mack The Knife\t\t- With Quincy Jones And Orchestra\n[23] Love's Been Good To Me\n[24] L.A.
