The drum tracks wre taken from the master tapes recordede fro the 'Stay Hugnry' sessions in 1984. All the guitars, bass and vocals were added last year specially fo this project. The songs were  recorded and mixed by Mark Mendoza and engineered by Denny McNerney. The fidelity is excellent.\n\nTracks 3 thru 9 were from a radio show that was never broadcast on Halloween 1979. The master tapes were discovered after sitting around in a closet  for 21 years! The concert was recorded on 1-inch 8-track tape. This gave us the ability to mix it. This is something that we did not get a chance to do with other local radio shows. Themixing was done by Mark Mendoza and Denny McNerney. This is the very first performance of 'You Know I Cry' and 'Honey, Look Three Times. The fidelity is good.\n\nTracks 10 thru 13 are from off the air, first generation cassette copies. we have spent several years trying to locate the original WLIR and WBAB recordings, but have not been successful. Many of you  these special or similar versions of these tracks. The compression of the radio broadcasts compromises the fidelity. \n\nSit back and enjoy the energy which makes up for the erratic sound quality.\n\n\n--Jay Jay French\n\nSeptember, 2001\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\tDee Snider\tLead Vocals\n\tJay Jay French\tGuitar &amp; Vocals on &quot;Can't Stand Still&quot;\n\t Mark Mendoza\tBass &amp; Vocals\n\t  Eddie Ojeda\t Guitar &amp; Vocals\n\tTony Petri\tDrums &amp; Percussion\n\nA.
