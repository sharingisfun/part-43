Young Margaret wants nothing more than to be an MP, but may be too much of a rebel for the Conservative Party of the 1950s. She did not have a 'good war', she is interested in politics and she thinks a woman's place can be in the House as well as the home. \n\nBroadcast on:BBC Four, 10:30pm Saturday 5th June 2010\nFirst broadcast:Tuesday 17th June 2008\nDuration:80 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4be5d0d616dc52b4008fcb490da53a63bc0db0b","amp;dn":"Margaret+Thatcher+-+The+Long+Walk+to+Finchley.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4be5d0d616dc52b4008fcb490da53a63bc0db0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,190,93,13,97,109,197,43,64,8,252,180,144,218,83,166,59,192,219,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
