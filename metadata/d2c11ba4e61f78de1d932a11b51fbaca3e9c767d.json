That's when we began to stain our pink lungs with cigarettes and sit on the hoods of cars in fields, playing music on a one-speaker boom box: Elvis Costello's &quot;Trust&quot; and &quot;Armed Forces,&quot; Warren Zevon, They Might Be Giants, &quot;Nebraska,&quot; the Violent Femmes and, especially, REM's &quot;Dead Letter Office.&quot; \n\nI completely respect a band's right to make the music they want to make, but at the same time I'm firmly a fan of REM's pre-&quot;Losing My Religion&quot; stuff (so fans of latter albums should take my 5-star rave with several grains of salt). And I love &quot;Reckoning&quot; and &quot;Fables&quot; and &quot;Murmur&quot; and most of all &quot;Life's Rich Pageant.&quot; They're great, hand-tooled classics. \n\nBut &quot;Dead Letter&quot; is loose, banged-out, sloppy music by a surly young band for surly young people growing up in the waning days of the Reagan era. \n\n&quot;Ages of You&quot; and &quot;Voice of Harold&quot; and &quot;Rotary Ten&quot; and &quot;King of the Road&quot; just kind of sum up winter, 87, for me and I can't listen to them without thinking about warm cans of Milwaukee's Best, Lucky Strikes and cottonmouth. And the covers of &quot;There She Goes Again&quot; and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; led me directly to the Velvet Underground. Let me say that again: This Album Led Me to The Velvet Underground. Can an album, or anything, do more for a listener than that? I don't think so. \n\nby Clare Quilty\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Crazy.wma                                                   \n02 - There She Goes Again.wma                                    \n03 - Burning Down.wma                                            \n04 - Voice Of Herold.wma                                         \n05 - Burning Hell.wma                                            \n06 - White Tornado.wma                                           \n07 - Toys In The Attic.wma                                       \n08 - Windout.wma                                                 \n09 - Ages Of You.wma                                             \n10 - Pale Blue Eyes.wma                                          \n11 - Rotary Ten.wma                                              \n12 - Bandwagon.wma                                               \n13 - Femme Fatale.wma                                            \n14 - Walters Theme.wma                                           \n15 - King Of The Road.wma                                        \n16 - Wolves, Lower.wma                                           \n17 - Gardening At Night.wma                                      \n18 - Carnival Of Sorts (Box Cars).wma                            \n19 - 1,000,000.wma                                               \n20 - Stumble.wma     \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nDEDICATED TO azza1969","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c11ba4e61f78de1d932a11b51fbaca3e9c767d","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Dead+Letter+Office+%281987%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c11ba4e61f78de1d932a11b51fbaca3e9c767d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,193,27,164,230,31,120,222,29,147,42,17,181,31,186,202,62,156,118,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
