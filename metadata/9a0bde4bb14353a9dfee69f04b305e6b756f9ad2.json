It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 1.05 million copies in its first week. According to the RIAA website, the album has sold over 6 million copies in United States as of 2008.\n\nAmazon.com\nThe splicing together of nu metal, rap, funk, and sterile electronica laced with dark melodies as infectious as anything Britney has to offer inspired 6 million people to purchase copies of Limp Bizkit's Significant Other. With Chocolate Starfish, they perfect their formula. From the electro-infused &quot;Intro&quot; through the contagiously chugging &quot;My Generation&quot; to the straight-up rap of &quot;Getcha Groove On,&quot; Chocolate Starfish is a slick, clinical, and flawless platform for Fred Durst's effortlessly savage--and occasionally unintentionally comic--sociological rants geared toward disaffected youth. Ultimately, though, it's that undeniably intelligent musical backdrop--the brooding guitar sound that gave the Mission Impossible 2 theme haunting new life and menace, and that defines &quot;Hot Dog,&quot; &quot;Full Nelson,&quot; &quot;My Way,&quot; &quot;Rollin',&quot; &quot;Boiler,&quot; and &quot;It'll Be Okay&quot;--that makes this a seething work of genius. The fact is, with rap and rock saying pretty much the same thing, Limp Bizkit have plenty of competition. They just do what they do better than everyone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***** - I have added 4 extra tracks by slitting tracks 8 &amp; 12 because these contained bonus hidden tracks.
