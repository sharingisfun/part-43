Encouraging fans for\ntheir input, the band included the almost thousand fans who turned up from\naround the world to sing a chorus. Kanye West also collaborated on the track\n'Hurricane'.\n\nThe new album brings the group back to the sound familiar to their self-titled\nalbum, and will strike the right chords for fans of the band.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nInfo:\n\nLike it?
