Like most tribute albums, it features cover versions of many Queen songs by various artists, but uniquely the songs are not performed by established groups. Instead, the album is performed by a group of musicians who normally perform with other groups or artists, in different combinations for each track.\n\nNotable artists featured on the album include Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci, the Kulick brothers and Lemmy. The musicians involved come mainly from a metal background, having performed with the likes of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead, Deep Purple, Impellitteri, Meat Loaf, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Dream Theater, Megadeth, Quiet Riot, Hawaii, Cacophony, Ozzy Osbourne, Whitesnake and Black Sabbath.\n\nThe album was re-released in the UK as Top Musicians Play Queen: The Collectors Collection with &quot;Keep Yourself Alive&quot; omitted and a 2010 recording of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, with John Wetton on vocals, added.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/2007/frontkd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/2007/frontkd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
