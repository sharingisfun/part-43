Robert Crumb is a respected but controversial underground comic book artist and writer whose creations include the popular &quot;Keep on Truckin'&quot; and Fritz the Cat (1972). Crumb's adult subject matter includes weird sexual obsessions, social criticism, and personal, confessional observations about abnormal human psychology. The genesis and meaning of Crumb's work is explained through a series of interviews with his colleagues, former lovers, and especially family members, which reveal a horrific upbringing that has crippled both Crumb and his siblings -- but has also fueled the artist's groundbreaking work. A long-time friend of the film's subject, director Terry Zwigoff followed Crumb  (1994) with another comic book-related project, Ghost World (2000), a drama based on a story from the anthology series &quot;Eightball&quot; by Daniel Clowes. \n\nCAST:\n\nRobert Hughes - Art Critic\nRobert Crumb  - Himself\nCharles Crumb  \t\nMaxon Crumb  \t\nAline Kominsky  \t\n\n\nRipped from a 2nd generation VHS tape.\nVery watchable.\nDue to the length of the video the last 3 minutes are missing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8db117b8042c8fd7f394f69a0278ca33df659b","amp;dn":"CRUMB.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8db117b8042c8fd7f394f69a0278ca33df659b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,141,177,23,184,4,44,143,215,243,148,246,154,2,120,202,51,223,101,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
