Along with the releases of East Coast legends Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits, this is another album that contributed to the spawn of a million bands today to play faster, heavier, and to incorporate a breakdown segment in each of their songs. But hardly any of those clone bands could even come close to front on the style of Sick of It All. With a take-no-crap-from-anybody attitude, Blood, Sweat &amp; No Tears blazes through 19 tracks of aggressive, start-stop hardcore that doesn't allow one chance for a breather. Not one song on here doesn't pump the adrenaline up a couple notches, while standouts like &quot;Rat Pack,&quot; &quot;Clobberin' Time&quot; and &quot;My Life&quot; could inspire enough energy to bring out the tough guy in all of us. Essential for all those who need a lesson in &quot;Hardcore 101&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4410b08c93ff98945b85c8c2e1577363bb2eee00","amp;dn":"Sick+Of+It+All+-+Blood%2C+sweat%2C+and+no+tears+%281989%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4410b08c93ff98945b85c8c2e1577363bb2eee00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,16,176,140,147,255,152,148,91,133,200,194,225,87,115,99,187,46,238,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
