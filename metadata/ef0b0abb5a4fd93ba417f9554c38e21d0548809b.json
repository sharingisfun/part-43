Most memorable is a classic rendition of &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot; featuring the exuberant altoist Cannonball Adderley, who is the main soloist on most of the selections. \n\nOther key voices include Evans' piano, guitarist Chuck Wayne and trumpeter Johnny Coles. This is near-classic music that showed that Gil Evans did not need Miles Davis as a soloist to inspire him to greatness. \n\n\n\n\n\n01. St.Louis Blues (W.C.Handy) 5:26\n02.
