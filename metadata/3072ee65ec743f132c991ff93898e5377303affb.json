For  example,  you can  take  a recording  of  an \n   unremarkable drum kit and dial in some really hard-hitting attack or take a \n   very percussive sound and soften the  attack. You can also use the  sustain \n   control to  work on  the decay  portion of  sounds, and  with drums you can \n   tighten up the sound to give a fast, dry decay or you can make them ring as \n   though you'd taken the  dampers off the kit.  It's just like having  remote \n   control over the amount of damping tape stuck to the drum heads, but  after \n   the recording. Other than a compressor this process is independent of level \n   and the effect is the same  regardless of whether the input signal  is loud \n   or soft. Unique to TDESIGN is  the ability to shape the transient  not only \n   amplitude wise but also with a dynamically controlled 24 dB lowpass  filter \n   with resonance control. This gives you the opportunity to change the  sound \n   in  a  way which  normally  is only  possible  if you  recreate  it with  a \n   synthesizer ! The  transient design process  works best on  drums and other \n   material which exhibits strong rhythmical components. But its really worth \n   to try it with other input sources \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n             \n   The Transient Former \n             \n   - Attack amplification/attenuation. \n   - Sustain amplification/attenuation. \n   - Dynamic Transient filtering \n   - 24 dB Lowpass with resonance \n   - Multi channel capability \n   - Easy user interface. \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n                    \n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3072ee65ec743f132c991ff93898e5377303affb","amp;dn":"VirSyn.TDesign.VST.RTAS.v1.0.1-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3072ee65ec743f132c991ff93898e5377303affb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,114,238,101,236,116,63,19,44,153,31,249,56,152,229,55,115,3,175,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
