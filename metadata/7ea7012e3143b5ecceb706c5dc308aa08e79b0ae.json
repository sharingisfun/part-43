Goyer has a deliciously twisted mind - they don't call him\n &quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot; for nothing. And he knows how to bring comic book\n characters and superheroes to kicking, screaming, vengeful life, as he did\n in The Crow: City of Angels, the Blade series, and Batman Begins. His intense\n Batman screenplay, written with director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia),\n resurrected the moribund Dark Knight franchise and confirmed his writing voice\n as a go-to source for a green light. Here, in this wry and surprising dialogue,\n Goyer reveals his tricks of the trade for how to intimidate a room full of studio\n executives, when to stand on principle, how to hook an actor's ego with killer\n character descriptions and dialogue, and why fear can pay the bills. \n\n\n  \n enjoy!                                                                  \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                     \n      Release notes                                                        \n                                                                     \n                                                              \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n                                                                    \n                                                                     \n     Greetings                                                             \n                                                                     \n                                                                    \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \nNTX aAF FiCO HNR CiNEFiLE AEN HUMANiSM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ea7012e3143b5ecceb706c5dc308aa08e79b0ae","amp;dn":"The.Dialogue.David.Goyer.2006.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ea7012e3143b5ecceb706c5dc308aa08e79b0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,167,1,46,49,67,181,236,206,183,6,197,220,48,138,160,142,121,176,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
