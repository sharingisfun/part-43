They also identify disadvantaged groups of population and regions and suggest policies, strategies and opportunities for investment to benefit them. They target Arab decision-makers and opinion leaders in governments and civil societies.\n\nAs instruments for measuring human progress and triggering action for change, the AHDRs feed into and draw upon the data and analysis of the global Human Development Reports. Taking the human development approach to the regional level, the AHDRs promote regional partnerships for influencing change and region-specific approaches to human rights, poverty, education, economic reform, HIV/AIDS, and globalization.\n\nPrepared and owned by Arabs as an advocacy tool designed to appeal to a wide audience, they spur public debates and mobilize support for action and change through processes of consultation, research and report writing. They have helped to articulate perceptions and priorities in the region, and have served as a source of alternate policy opinion for development planning across varied themes. \n\nUNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States is pleased to announce the launch of its Arab Regional Report, &quot;Challenges to Human Security in the Arab Countries&quot;  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.undp.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.undp.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nfrom the report...\n\n&quot;the present study takes up that subject as it concerns the Arab countries.1 Its\nstarting point is that, seven years after the publication of the first Arab Human\nDevelopment Report, the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fault lines as traced in that analysis may have\ndeepened.2 The question thus arises: why have obstacles to human development\nin the region proved so stubborn?\nThis new Report proposes that the answers lie in the fragility of the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\npolitical, social, economic and environmental structures, in its lack of peoplecentred\ndevelopment policies and in its vulnerability to outside intervention.\nTogether, these characteristics undermine human securityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the kind of material\nand moral foundation that secures lives, livelihoods and an acceptable quality of\nlife for the majority. Human security is a prerequisite for human development, and\nits widespread absence in Arab countries has held back their progress.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6de9eb1069978ffa367c73611e3447f6966efdb","amp;dn":"Arab+Human+Development+Reports+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6de9eb1069978ffa367c73611e3447f6966efdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,222,158,177,6,153,120,255,163,103,199,54,17,227,68,127,105,102,239,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
