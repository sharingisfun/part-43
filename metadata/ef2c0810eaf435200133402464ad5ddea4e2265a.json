Then we go back to Russia of the early 20th century and the drama unfolds.\n\nRasputin holds a powerful hold on the Imperial Couple and the Romanov Empire, during all this we see Prince Felix Yusupov falling in love with Irina while Rasputin still holds power. In a matter of time Rasputin's influence becomes too powerful and Prince Yusupov and fellow noblemen decide to kill him...\n\nThis movie, made in the late 60's, is unique not only for its opening but also for it's great sets and use of historical photographs. It recreates St. Petersburg as it was in Imperial Russia, with great eye for detail, amazing sets and wonderful costumes. It uses pictures of the Imperial Family, but sadly the Imperial Family only are shown in one scene - durring an official photoshoot, incorrect because the Imperial Family seems to be posing with servants and close friends. This would not happen for an official picture - and they are often mentioned. The score is also quite good, typical for those classic movies, and keeps on the dramatic suspense. This movie was also based upon Felix Yusupov's Memoires &quot;Lost Splendor&quot;.\n\nLittle after the release of the film Prince Yusupov died, thus this is the last recording of him, and about a year later also his wife Irina died. \n\nThis movie is in French and Russian, 2 selectable audio-tracks, without subtitles.\n\nIf anyone is willing to work on subtitles, let me know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2c0810eaf435200133402464ad5ddea4e2265a","amp;dn":"J%5C%27ai+tu%C3%83%C2%A9+Raspoutine%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef2c0810eaf435200133402464ad5ddea4e2265a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,44,8,16,234,244,53,32,1,51,64,36,100,173,93,222,164,226,38,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
