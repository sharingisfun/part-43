KimberlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s chilling home footage of her hometown before, during, and after the storm provides a petrifying account that essentially rewrites most of the media coverage of the disaster. Broadcast news stories of rampant looting are transformed into ingeniously heroic tales of survival, while recent stories of a thriving recovery in New Orleans are exposed as a false bill of goods sold on the backs of the disenfranchised. Trouble the Water makes unapologetically clear that Hurricane Katrina rages on as an unnatural disaster of governmental and journalistic neglect.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bbaba1623fede6d35391a0b79c32fc680d09cfb","amp;dn":"Trouble.The.Water.2008.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-HNR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bbaba1623fede6d35391a0b79c32fc680d09cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,186,186,22,35,254,222,109,53,57,26,11,121,195,47,198,128,208,156,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
