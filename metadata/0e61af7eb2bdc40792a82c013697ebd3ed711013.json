In contrast to the delay machines youre \n   used to FDELAY splits  the frequency spectrum of  the input signal into  27 \n   bands and applies a separate delay  unit to each band. The delay  times can \n   be synchronized to the host tempo generating nearly infinite rhythmical and \n   sonic variations of the input signal. \n             \n   For each of the delay bands you  can specify the delay time, the level  and \n   the  feedback  amount  separately.  These  parameter  changes  can  even be \n   automized in realtime for glitch free rhythmical morphings. \n             \n   A few high level parameters let you change the delay times and feedbacks of \n   all delays with the turn of a single knob \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n   The Rhythmiser \n             \n   - 27 band realtime multiband delay. \n   - Frequency dependant level, delay time and feedback \n   - Linear phase precision filters for maximal transparency \n   - Tempo syncable delay times up to 6 seconds. \n   - Meta parameter for quick access to rhythm variations \n   - Minimized latency ( 12 ms ) \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e61af7eb2bdc40792a82c013697ebd3ed711013","amp;dn":"VirSyn.FDelay.VST.RTAS.v1.0.1-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e61af7eb2bdc40792a82c013697ebd3ed711013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,97,175,126,178,189,196,7,146,168,44,1,54,151,235,211,237,113,16,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
