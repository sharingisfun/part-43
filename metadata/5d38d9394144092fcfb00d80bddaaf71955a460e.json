The band have had two incarnations: the first piloted by George until his death in 1979 and the Payne -led second version, who reformed in 1988 and still play today.\nThe band were set up by ex-Mothers of Invention guitarist Lowell George, renowned for his slide guitar technique. Over the course of his reign as group leader the band played a variety of styles, with the first two blues/rock albums noted as fan favourites. The band released seven studio albums and one live one, Waiting for Columbus. The platinum-selling record, which features contributions from Rolling Stone Mick Taylor, has been described as being among the best live albums recorded.\nThe band reformed in 1988 led by Bill Payne. Their first album Let It Roll was released to positive reviews and became gold-selling. Although the new line-up have had trouble bringing along the earlier bands' fans, subsequent releases have sold moderately well and the band continue to tour.\nIt would be accurate to describe Little Feat in its original configuration as a very good band fronted by a genius, but it doesn't adequately acknowledge just how very, very good the other members of the band were. Lowell George was on a totally different level than the other members, but they weren't dispensable for all that. Although both LITTLE FEAT and SAILIN' SHOES, their first two albums, are exceedingly close to being as fine as the masterful DIXIE CHICKEN, what separates the latter for the previous two is the astonishingly accomplished playing of the other band members. George remains the focal point of the group, writing an exceptional set of songs and providing powerful lead vocals, but far more than the earlier two albums, the rest of the band holds its own. Stylistically, this one shows a deep influence by New Orleans music, and even features an Allen Toussaint tune. \n\nAlthough they went on to release a couple of more decent albums before their break up in the late 1970s, as well as an exceptional live album WAITING FOR COLUMBUS, this represents Little Feat's supreme studio achievement. Absolutely everything clicks on this album, and the eclectic nature of all the songs seems utterly natural. The band manages throughout the album to sound simultaneously restrained and impassioned. Unlike many bands who work in a variety of styles, they never sound like they are doing a parody of any genre. \n\nDespite the improvements in the band as a whole, this is still Lowell George's outfit. George undoubtedly belongs to a short list of musicians whose premature death (of a heart attack at age 34) deprived us of a significant body of work. I have been amazed at how many of my musically astute friend are not aware of George. I'm uncertain whether I most appreciate Lowell George the songwriter or Lowell George the singer. There is no question he was a master crafter of first rate songs, but he was every bit as good as a singer, with a full, round lower register capable of sliding into a marvelous upper range. \n\nFor those new to Little Feat, I strongly recommend four albums to the would-be collector. In addition to this stellar album, one should get both LITTLE FEAT and SAILIN' SHOES, both of them featuring one of the finest songs written in the past 30 years, George's spectacular &quot;Willin'.&quot; I never saw Little Feat live, I'm sorry to say, but they had a reputation for being one of the best live bands around, and their WAITING FOR COLUMBUS has to rank as one of the better live albums ever cut. Little Feat broke up in the late seventies and reformed in the late 1980s, but without George they were merely a good band instead of a great one. These four albums will give most fans all the Little Feat that they would ever desire.
