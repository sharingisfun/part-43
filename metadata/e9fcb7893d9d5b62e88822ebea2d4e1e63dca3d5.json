I've tested it many times, but just in case - report any problems if you'll encounter any.\n\n\nOh, yeah, forgot to tell - this is still a Beta patch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadme copied from previous torrent:\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\nOk, this is a repack of all existing Dragon Age 2 DLCs. It contains:\n\n\n- Black Emporium\n- Pre-Order Bonus Items\n- Signature Edition Items\n- The Exiled Prince\n\n(Isaac's armor from Dead Space 2 is obviously included too).\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):\n\n\n* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press &quot;Install&quot;;\n\n* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list;\n\n* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking &quot;DragonAge2.exe&quot; file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nFeel free to share this everywhere you can and want. You shouldn't have any problems, but just in case, report anything.\n\n*******\n\nOh, and the usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no \nviruses, and have never been any.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9fcb7893d9d5b62e88822ebea2d4e1e63dca3d5","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+2+DLC+Pack+%28with+Patch+1.01%29+-illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9fcb7893d9d5b62e88822ebea2d4e1e63dca3d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,252,183,137,61,157,91,98,232,136,34,235,234,45,78,30,99,220,163,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
