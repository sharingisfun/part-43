But it's perfect in dealing with transients. \n             \n   Pitch shifting on the other side sounds &quot;right&quot;, but the transients go  mad \n   and the sound gets metallic and grainy especially on high down shiftings. \n             \n   PRISM splits the  spectrum in 27  bands and applies  a different amount  of \n   frequency shifting to each band  emulating a harmonic pitch shifting.  This \n   gives you perfect pitch  shifting for all kind  of drum sounds over  a vast \n   shifting range  of +/-  five octaves  without disturbing  the transients or \n   introducing  metallic  distortions.  With  harmonic  sounds  you  will  get \n   inharmonicities but it's much better behaved than pure frequency  shifting. \n   The extreme range of shifting gives  you access to a vast field  of unknown \n   sonic territory.  \n             \n   The  possibility  to  apply  different shiftings  on  each  band  gives you \n   exciting possibilities: \n             \n   Suppose you have a drum loop which  is perfect, but the bass drum is  a bit \n   too high or too  low to fit in  your mix then you  can easily get the  bass \n   drum shifted a bit down and the rest of the spectrum remains unchanged.. \n             \n             \n   Features: \n             \n             \n   The Pitch Designer \n             \n   - 27 band realtime frequency shifter. \n   - 27 band equalizer \n   - Linear phase precision filters for maximal transparency \n   - +/- 5 octaves frequency shift per band \n   - Envelope follower controlled pitch modulation. \n   - LFO controlled pitch modulation. \n   - Surround operation * \n   - Minimized latency ( 12 ms ) \n             \n             \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a46a0707b49e3bda61a5350462338195e8766e","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Prism.VST.RTAS.v1.1.0-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a46a0707b49e3bda61a5350462338195e8766e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,164,106,7,7,180,158,59,218,97,165,53,4,98,51,129,149,232,118,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
