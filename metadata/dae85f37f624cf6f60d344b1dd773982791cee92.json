It took over the BBC2 late night slot from &quot;Disco Two&quot;, which had been running since January 1970, while continuing to feature non-chart music. It was devised by BBC producer Rowan Ayers. According to presenter Bob Harris, the programme derived its name from\n... a 'tin pan alley' phrase from years ago. When they got the first pressing of a record they would play it to people they called the old greys [doormen in grey suits]. The ones they could remember and could whistle having heard it just once or twice had passed the old grey whistle test.\n\nJohnny Winter has been a guitar hero without equal. Signing to Columbia records in 1969 called largest solo artist deal of itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time, Johnny immediately laid out the blueprint for his fresh take on classic blues a prime combination for the legions of fans just discovering the blues via the likes of Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton. Constantly shifting between simple country blues in the vein of Robert Johnson, to all-out electric slide guitar blues-rock, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Johnny has always been one of the most respected singers and guitar players in rock and the clear link between British blues-rock and American Southern rock (a la the Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd.) Throughout the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢80s, Johnny was the unofficial torch-bearer for the blues, championing and aiding the careers of his idols like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker.\n\n\n1 Hideaway \n2 Messin' with the Kid \n3 Mississippi Delta Blues \n4 Walkin by myself \n5 Rock and Roll \n\nJohnny Winter: Vocals, Guitar\nJohn Paris       :Bass, Harmonica\nTom Compton: Drums\n\nGeneral\nComplete name : F:\\DVD\\Johnny Winter Old Grey Whistle Test 1979.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 370 MiB\nDuration                         : 35mn 40s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 450 Kbps\nWriting library                  : Boilsoft AVI tool build 1/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 35mn 40s\nBit rate                         : 1 249 Kbps\nWidth                            : 640 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.163\nStream size                      : 319 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                        : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 35mn 40s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 49.0 MiB (13%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae85f37f624cf6f60d344b1dd773982791cee92","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+Old+Grey+Whistle+Test+1979%28avi%29%28blues%29%5Brogercc%5D%5B%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae85f37f624cf6f60d344b1dd773982791cee92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,232,95,55,246,36,207,111,96,211,68,177,221,119,57,130,121,28,238,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
