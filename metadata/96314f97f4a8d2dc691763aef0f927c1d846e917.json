All's thats needed is a cd-r and a dreamcast \n               console or you can try an emulator.

You\n           can find the manfacture date on the bottom of the console on the sticker\n           in fine print just look for it. Of course the only way to know is to\n           just try it on your dreamcast.\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nThis is the original game which was made for the dreamcast and was later ported to the ps2 and xbox 360. Rez is a Music Rhythm based shooter, and is a sweet game. \n\nRez is a fast-action shooter that takes you deep into the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s computer network. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œProject KÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEden,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos.\n\nYou must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.\n\nThe game is notable for replacing the typical sound effects found in most rail shooter games with electronic music, with sounds and melodies created by the player as they target and destroy foes in the game, Sega used the concept of synesthesia in Rez which can be experienced when playing.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* A stunning shooting game.\n\n* Wire-frame adventure backed by industrial beats.\n\n* Dreamlike cyber-environments.\n\n* Your actions affect the music and graphics.\n\n* Journey to the center of a futuristic network.\n\n\n\nGame Pics included.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% or Discjuggler (Both included in download).\n\nIn Options enable overburn disc in Alcohol or DiscJuggler.
