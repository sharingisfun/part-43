The plotnebbish Don Knotts bumbles his way through a haunted house is a perfect vehicle for Mizzy's gifts, and over the course of this soundtrack he comically upends virtually every clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© of horror movie music, gently mocking the genre's conventions while expanding its parameters with the addition of jazz and garage-rock elements. Fans of Raymond Scott and Carl Stalling will enjoy this as well; even the titles (&quot;Gaseous Globe&quot; and &quot;Plucky Chicken,&quot; to name just two) are delightful.\n\n      - Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e88eacc2b568ee61d941b83f80912ca69e3d4ae","amp;dn":"Vic+Mizzy+-+The+Ghost+and+Mr.+Chicken+OST+%5B1967%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e88eacc2b568ee61d941b83f80912ca69e3d4ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,136,234,204,43,86,142,230,29,148,27,131,248,9,18,202,105,227,212,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
