November Hotel\n10.All Alone\n\n\n\nReview taken from Rollingstone.com:\n\n\nBelieve it or not, Mad Season face some stiff odds. On one hand, they're a Seattle supergroup.\n On the other, they're a Seattle supergroup. They could rest on the laurels\n of their lineup ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alice in Chains singer Layne Staley, Pearl Jam lead guitarist\n Mike McCready and Screaming Trees drummer Barrett Martin, with newcomer\n John Baker Saunders on bass ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or their collaboration could make a nice,\n fat target for naysayers. Mad Season may not have the special chemistry that makes\n their respective groups so successful, but they do have presence, and more importantly,\n they take artistic risks and set out to make something fresh on Above.\n\nSometimes, Mad Season slip up, indulging opaque lyrics into which fans might read\n Seattle-related meanings (&quot;Rich and growing sicker/Sell the dead ones\n quicker&quot; goes a line in &quot;X-Ray Mind&quot;). Meanwhile, &quot;Artificial Red&quot; might have been\n more aptly titled &quot;Artificial Blues,&quot; and the arena-rock pomp and stilted\n rhymes of &quot;Lifeless Dead&quot; highlight the album's hit-or-miss quality.\n Cut from the album's final version was a much-needed palate cleanser in the form of\n a soothing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if brief ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic interlude.\n\nWhen they plunge into the two-ton metal groove of &quot;I Don't Know Anything,&quot; the\n over-the-top country-rock angst of &quot;River of Deceit&quot; (&quot;My pain is self-chosen,&quot; sings Staley)\n or the eerie cryptojazz of &quot;Wake Up,&quot; Mad Season coalesce into something promising.\n In a particular trio of tunes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;November Hotel,&quot; &quot;All Alone&quot; and\n &quot;Long Gone Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they kindle their creative sparks into music that gives off real heat.\n The lengthy instrumental jam &quot;November Hotel&quot; allows McCready, Martin and Saunders\n the chance to stretch out, providing an energetic high point as well as a canvas for\n McCready's riffs and ravings. And in &quot;All Alone,&quot; Staley lets his voice\n become the song's focus, crystalline and strong, backed by a tensile, almost sitarlike drone.\n\nPerhaps the last word on Mad Season, though, comes in &quot;Long Gone Day,&quot; a lustrous duet\n in which Staley trades verses with Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, whose\n honeyed growl is in its element among the cool percussion, sensitive sax and pliant bass.\n That Mad Season are capable of tremendous power and also succeed with such a subtle song\n proves that the band is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at times ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more than the mere sum of its parts.
