PC Inspector File Recovery \nMy number one choice for recovering files - especially off of a FAT 32 - or any USB Flash Drive for that matter. But it'll also work on your Hard-Drive. An absolute recommend.\n\n2. Data Shredder\n\nI use this software whenever I need to permanently get rid of files. It's simple, easy to use GUI makes this program very flexible in its usage. You don't even have to install it, as it's a portable application. It's only around 300K, and it includes a 1 pass fast method, a DDoD Army 3 pass, a DdoD Airforce 7 pass method, and the 35 pass Gutmann method. Which is, well, a little overkill to me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9f7b7ca1b9b41fd9f56ca8d46d835cf19060ec6","amp;dn":"File+Recovery+and+a+%5C%22Unique%5C%22+Data+Shredder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9f7b7ca1b9b41fd9f56ca8d46d835cf19060ec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,247,183,202,27,155,65,253,159,86,202,141,70,216,53,207,25,6,14,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
