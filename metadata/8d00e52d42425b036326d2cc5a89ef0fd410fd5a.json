Done by the Maysles brothers - the duo behind the Rolling Stones' &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; later in the decade - the film captures all the excitement [and footage] of the Beatles' triumphant arrival in America, including all their Ed Sullivan appearances, various backstage reflections and shenanigans, and an extended, supercharged sequence of their concert at Washington Coliseum. For my money, this film is even MORE essential than A Hard Day's Night; it is, quite simply, the best extended visual document of the Beatles that we have.\n\nDirectors:\nKathy Dougherty, Susan FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶mke, and 2 more credits Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nStars:\nMurray the 'K', Brian Epstein and George Harrison \n\n\nF.Y.I. Check out John Acting Like a Cripple on stage In DC, when Paul tells every body to clap.\n\nF.Y.I. The Girls use to throw Jelly Beans as a sign of Love? Who Knows.
