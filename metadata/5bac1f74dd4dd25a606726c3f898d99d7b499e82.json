Chemicals that have been poured into the swamp brought him back to life, as a decomposed swamp monster zombie.\n\nAfter the events of Salvation Run, Cyrus Gold was able to come back to life, this time in his human form.  He is visited by the Phantom Stranger and Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern, who tell him that he has seven days to break the curse of Solomon Grundy for good.\n\nThis one-shot and mini-series acts as a prelude to the Green Lantern Blackest Night storyline.\n\nWritten by Geoff Johns and Scott Kolins, with Kolins also providing the art.\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bac1f74dd4dd25a606726c3f898d99d7b499e82","amp;dn":"Solomon+Grundy+-+Blackest+Night+Prelude+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bac1f74dd4dd25a606726c3f898d99d7b499e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,172,31,116,221,77,210,90,96,103,38,195,248,152,217,157,123,73,158,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
