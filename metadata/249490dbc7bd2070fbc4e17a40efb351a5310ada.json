It follows symbologist Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu as they investigate a murder in Paris's Louvre Museum and discover a battle between the Priory of Sion and Opus Dei over the possibility of Jesus having been married to Mary Magdalene.\nThe title of the novel refers to, among other things, the fact that the murder victim is found in the Grand Gallery of the Louvre, naked and posed like Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a pentacle drawn on his chest in his own blood.\n\nThe novel has provoked a popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and Magdalene's role in the history of Christianity. The book has been extensively denounced by many Christian denominations as an attack on the Roman Catholic Church. It has also been criticized for its historical and scientific inaccuracy.\n\nThe book is a worldwide bestseller that sold 80 million copies as of 2009[1] and has been translated into 44 languages. This makes it, as of 2010, the best selling English language novel of the 21st century and the 2nd biggest selling novel of the 21st century in any language. Combining the detective, thriller, and conspiracy fiction genres, it is Brown's second novel to include the character Robert Langdon, the first being his 2000 novel Angels &amp; Demons. In November 2004, Random House published a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006, a film adaptation was released by Sony's Columbia Pictures.\n\n\n- 64Kbps - Stereo - 22.050 KHz - AAC - .m4b audiobook format\n\n- Includes audiobook cover art\n\nConverted in IPOD format by - CHOSEN\n\n\n-Chosen\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:249490dbc7bd2070fbc4e17a40efb351a5310ada","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+The+Da+Vinci+Code+IPOD+AudioBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"249490dbc7bd2070fbc4e17a40efb351a5310ada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,148,144,219,199,189,32,112,251,196,225,122,64,239,179,81,165,49,10,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
