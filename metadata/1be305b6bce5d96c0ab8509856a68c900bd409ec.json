Forming his own group in 1945, he was popular for a decade thanks to record like 'Kidney Stew' and 'Cherry Red'. He spent much of the '50s and '60s out of music, but thereafter regained a following in both the US and Europe. Singing or blowing alto sax, Vinson had a hard , penetrating tone that cut through the most boisterous ensemble, and his recordings of the '40s and early '50s, whether with a big band or with smaller groups, are consistently good examples of the tough, unsentimental idiom conventionally, though not really adequately, described as 'blues shouting'. \n\nTracklist\n1.
