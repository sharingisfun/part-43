Until we can get this up, however, do know that Kaspersky is the antivirus brand we are using ourselves, and - unless anything extremely unexpectable happens - we are KasperskyÃ‚Â® life-timers. The level of protection KasperskyÃ‚Â® provides can't be beaten in our mind!\n\n \n\nFree Upgrades: KasperskyÃ‚Â® offers free upgrades to users with currently valid licenses. For example, if you hold a three year license to Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2010 and a new version launches within that time, you can upgrade to the newest version for free!\n\n\n\n*******All Uploads Guaranteed Virus Free,******\n*******Scanned with Kaspersky Anti-Virus,******\n*****Need anything scanned, or if you have*****\n*******Any problems Please let me know!********\n***You can reach me through &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2d55574c5f5f556d544c454242034e4240&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;***\n\n\nPlease comment Upload and let me know what you think!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5668ef3abad03307a6033017bff5dc57b610785","amp;dn":"Kaspersky+Anti-Virus+2010+with+keys+%28clean%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5668ef3abad03307a6033017bff5dc57b610785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,102,142,243,171,173,3,48,122,96,51,1,123,255,93,197,123,97,7,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
