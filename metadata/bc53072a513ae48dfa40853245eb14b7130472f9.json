The single features the former singer of Matia Bazar, Antonella Ruggiero, and was the second release from the 2009 album Under the Radar Over the Top.\n\n\n\n\nThe 1940s-themed video premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨red on 18 September, 2009. Shot in a cinematic style, it depicts the three band members, H. P. Baxxter, Rick J. Jordan, and Michael Simon escorting Antonella Ruggiero into an opera house, wearing full formal outfits. They enter through a storm of paparazzi and reporters. Jordan and Simon appear to be securing the premises, as Baxxter goes to a balcony seat. Ruggiero portrays an operatic singer, and she prepares for a large show before a mirror. Jordan spots an attractive woman climbing the stairs, and doesn't give it a second thought. Ruggiero exits out on the stage, and sings for a full house. Baxxter, Jordan, and Simon watch the show, and they notice an assassin (who is in fact the woman Jordan spotted earlier) poking a high precision rifle (the rifle is a .177 12 multi-shot CO2 air rifle) through the curtains on the floor above them. Jordan and Simon run up the stairs to apprehend the shooter, while Baxxter throws himself off the balcony in a failed attempt to take the bullet for Ruggiero. The bullet is fired, and Ruggiero dies in Baxxter's arms at the end of the video, as they escape the opera house.\n\n\nAn extended version of the video premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨red 25 September, 2009. The video features over 2 minutes of extra footage, and the extended version of the song. The end of the video shows the reflections of the three band members failed attempts to stop the sniper from killing Ruggiero. [5] The video was inspired by the opera scene in 1997 science fantasy film The Fifth Element.\n\nThe video, like many other Scooter videos, features a historic automobile.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc53072a513ae48dfa40853245eb14b7130472f9","amp;dn":"Scooter+-+Ti+Sento+%5BNew+Nov+2009%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc53072a513ae48dfa40853245eb14b7130472f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,83,7,42,81,58,228,141,250,64,133,50,69,235,20,183,19,4,114,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
