The album came about when she was working with the Corrs manager, John Hughes, and he offered her an album deal on his own Spokes label, and sent her to Los Angeles to work with Corrs producer Olle Romo, resulting in her debut album Dancing On Tables Barefoot. The first Tara Blaise solo single was &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, featuring only Tara's voice and a string quartet. Both &quot;Fool for Love&quot; and follow up &quot;Paperback ClichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot; were playlisted by BBC Radio 2 in the UK and Tara covered much ground with a tour of UK regional radio stations, perform with CorrsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ guitarist Anthony Drennan.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] The Three Degrees\n[02] Superman In A Bottle\n[03] Fool For Love\n[04] 21 Years\n[05] Paperback Cliche\n[06] Later\n[07] For Your Own Good\n[08] Feel Free\n[09] Radio Star\n[10] Ladybird\n[11] Little Girl\n[12] Unbearable Lightness\n \n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:45m:10s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 119mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 04 July 2005\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Spokes Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.tarablaise.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.mahalo.com/tara-blaise \n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/tara_blaise \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3c71fe41932639b3230b51b1581b91f63a4c09","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Dancing+On+Tables+Barefoot+-+Tara+Blaise+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3c71fe41932639b3230b51b1581b91f63a4c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,60,113,254,65,147,38,57,179,35,11,81,177,88,27,145,246,58,76,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
