It's hardly proving to be the utopian\n      dream he had hoped for. Arthur turns personal shopper to show\n      die-hard Sainsbury's families that his style of shopping and\n      cooking is better. And determined to challenge the conventional\n      model where overstocked shelves can lead to waste, Arthur goes\n      back to his roots as a chef and opens The People's Kitchen in\n      the supermarket. But will people be happy to eat food previously\n      destined for the bin?\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
