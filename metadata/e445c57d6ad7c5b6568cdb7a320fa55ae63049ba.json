I'm sure there have been more recorded and shared since 2003, but I don't think it's possible to find all of them anymore and this collection is fairly extensive as it is. There are 25 sets in total, spread over 35 .MP3 files.\n\nQuality varies. Most sets sound nice and clear with the majority having a bitrate between 128kbps and 192kbps. I am a bit of an audiophile myself, so while there are some sets that sound worse than others, I only kept them because there was no better copy available. In all instances, I tried to get the best recording possible.\n\nThis collection DOES NOT include any commercial releases (i.e. Balance 005). Only live sets and radio recordings. Two DJ sets are included that co-feature James Holden with (1) Nathan Fake (Essential Mix) and (2) Petter.\n\nTracklists for all sets are included in the LYRICS metatag of the .MP3 files (hint: foo_lyricsdb plugin). As ThePirateBay doesn't allow .txt/.rar files in the Audio&gt;Music upload category, I have made available all the tracklists in .txt files, contained in a single .rar archive at a direct download link, but I cannot paste it in this description, so check the first couple comments instead.\n\nReplayGain has also been calculated and applied directly to all .MP3 files in order to normalize volume levels across all files.\n\nThanks to evil from The B-Log (www.b-log.se) and TranceAddict.com forum members for many of these mixes and tracklists.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n/ MP3 FILE LIST\n\n+ James Holden - 4 Years Of Full Spectrum (Live @ Tivoli de Helling, Utrecht) (Part 1) (2008-09-19).mp3\n+ James Holden - 4 Years Of Full Spectrum (Live @ Tivoli de Helling, Utrecht) (Part 2) (2008-09-19).mp3\n+ James Holden - Border Community Night (Live @ Rex Club, Paris) (2009-04-11).mp3\n+ James Holden - Border Community Special (Live @ Planet Rose, Nijmegen) (Part 1) (2009-03-28).mp3\n+ James Holden - Border Community Special (Live @ Planet Rose, Nijmegen) (Part 2) (2009-03-28).mp3\n+ James Holden - Global DJ Broadcast Guestmix (2003-02-24).mp3\n+ James Holden - Igloofest 2009 (Live @ Montreal, Canada) (2009-01-30).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ 5 Days Off (Netherlands) (2008-07-03).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Club Exposure, The Hague (Part 1) (2004-04-17).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Club Exposure, The Hague (Part 2) (2004-04-17).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Club Exposure, The Hague (Part 3) (2004-04-17).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ DEMF '06 (2006-05-27).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Flex (Vienna) (2005-12-10).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Glow (2003-12-13).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ I Love Techno 2006 (2006-10-21).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Mazzo (Amsterdam, Holland) (2003-10-31).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ NEOPOPT Electronic Music Festival (Forte de Santiago da Barra, Portugal) (2009-08-13).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Pixel (Club 11, Amsterdam) (2007-12-22).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Planet Rose, NYC (2006-03-11).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Planet Rose, NYC (Part 1) (2006-03-12).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Planet Rose, NYC (Part 2) (2006-03-12).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Pukkelpop 2006 (Boiler Room) (2006-08-17).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Shake (Radio Virus) (2004-11-20).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Stompa Phunk (2006-06-02).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ Street Parade (2004-08-07).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ The Flame, Nautilus (Part 1) (2004-04-12).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ The Flame, Nautilus (Part 2) (2004-04-12).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ The Loft Electroclub (Lausanne) (2005-04-09).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live @ The Loft Electroclub (Lausanne) (2006-02-18).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live On Klubbers FM (2007-06-28) (Part 1).mp3\n+ James Holden - Live On Klubbers FM (2007-06-28) (Part 2).mp3\n+ James Holden - New Year's Eve Border Community Night (Live @ Melkweg, Amsterdam) (2008-12-31).mp3\n+ James Holden vs. Petter - Live @ Beachfactor (Barcelona) (Part 1) (2006-06-16).mp3\n+ James Holden vs. Petter - Live @ Beachfactor (Barcelona) (Part 2) (2006-06-16).mp3\n+ Nathan Fake &amp; James Holden - Essential Mix (2006-03-19).mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e445c57d6ad7c5b6568cdb7a320fa55ae63049ba","amp;dn":"James+Holden+DJ+Mixes+Collection+%282003-2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e445c57d6ad7c5b6568cdb7a320fa55ae63049ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,69,197,125,106,215,197,182,86,140,219,122,50,15,165,90,230,48,73,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
