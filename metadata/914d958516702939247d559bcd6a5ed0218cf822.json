[00:47:30.00]\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              THE ALLMUSIC REVIEW\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby Ned Raggett\n\nWhen news surfaced in 1995 that Alan Wilder had departed Depeche Mode to \nconcentrate on his solo project Recoil, the immediate concern among fans was \nwhether the band would be able to hit past heights again. Though Wilder's \nprofile was always much lesser than that of Martin Gore and David Gahan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and \nalmost even that of Alan Fletcher, whose nonperformance live has always been a \nrunning joke in the fan community and who freely admits to generally being \naround merely to maintain a vibe with his childhood friend Gore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ his capability \nat arranging the songs over the years gave the band its increasingly distinct, \nunique edge. Combined with Gahan's near suicide and lengthy recovery from drugs, \nthings looked bleak. Happily, Ultra turned out a winner; hooking up with Tim \nSimenon, longtime U.K. dance maven and producer of arty fare such as Gavin \nFriday's Adam 'n' Eve, Depeche delivered a strong album as a rejuvenated band. \nThe most immediate change was Gahan's singing; for the first time ever, he took \nsinging lessons beforehand, and his new control and projection simply shines, \nespecially on the marvelous &quot;It's No Good,&quot; a pulsing, tense, yet beautiful song \nwith another deeply romantic Gore lyric. Opener &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; continues in \nthe vein of arena-level stompers like &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; and &quot;I Feel \nYou,&quot; with huge drum slams and scratching to boot, but Ultra mostly covers \nsubtler territory, such as the slightly creepy &quot;Sister of Night&quot; and the gentle \n&quot;The Love Thieves.&quot; Gore sings two winners: the orchestral, slow dance groove \n&quot;Home&quot; and &quot;The Bottom Line,&quot; featuring steel guitar and Can's Jaki Liebezeit on \ndrums, distinctly different territory for Depeche. Closing with &quot;Insight,&quot; a \nquite lovely, building ballad, Ultra showed Depeche wasn't ready to quit by any \nmeans. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUltra is Depeche Mode's ninth full-length album, which was released by Mute \nRecords on April 14, 1997 (1997-04-14). The album is the first after the \ndeparture of Alan Wilder from the band, who left to focus on his solo project \nRecoil.\n\nUltra keeps the rock sound of their previous album and has a considerably darker \nand more industrial sound than Depeche Mode's previous releases.\n\nThe long time that separates this album from the previous was due to David \nGahan's near death and recovery from addiction to drugs. These two events caused \nmany to speculate the end of Depeche Mode, but this turned out to not be the \ncase.\n\nInstead, Ultra was eventually released, reaching #1 in the UK Albums Chart, #5 \nin the Billboard 200 and producing several hit singles. As of April 2006, Ultra \nhas sold 584,000 units in the U.S. The album was also notable for being the \nlongest the band has ever released until Sounds of the Universe was released in \n2009, clocking in at one hour, despite the project initially focused on being an \nEP.\n\nOn October 2, 2007 (October 3 in North America) Ultra was re-released in a two-\ndisc set, along with Exciter, completing the Depeche Mode Collectors Edition \ncatalogue. The first disc is a remastered version of the original album, on a \nSACD/CD hybrid (except for in the U.S., where it's a CD only). The second disc \nis a DVD which features the album in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo. \nThe b-sides from the album's singles can be listened to as well, including the \nstand-alone single &quot;Only When I Lose Myself&quot; and its b-sides.\n\nFinally, like the other albums, there is a documentary on the making of Ultra \ntitled &quot;Depeche Mode 95-98 (Oh well, that's the end of the band...)&quot;, the \nsubtitle of which comes from Martin Gore's thoughts about Alan Wilder's \ndeparture. The documentary begins with discussion from all parties of Wilder's \ndeparture before moving on to early album sessions despite Dave Gahan's drug \nissues present. Eventually, it moves on to Gahan's &quot;death&quot; and rehab. The \ndocumentary then covers the recording of Ultra and ends with a discussion on The \nSingles 86&gt;98 and its corresponding singles tour. The documentary is around 45 \nminutes to an hour long. The whole band is interviewed, along with Alan Wilder, \nDaniel Miller, producer Tim Simenon, Mute executives, Peter Gordeno, Christian \nEigner, Anton Corbijn and others.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBARREL OF A GUN     by Tim DiGravina\n\nThe stomping, pungent excellence of &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; seems an unlikely fit on \nthe otherwise subtle Ultra, but when Depeche Mode achieves a violent darkness as \ntangible as the one here, it's hard to complain. With Alan Wilder on a permanent \nleave of absence, it's up to producer Tim Simenon to fill the holes. And that he \ndoes with aplomb, helping the band to forge an eclectic, shaking racket as vital \nand edgy as that of his own Bomb the Bass project. The heart of the song is \ndistortion. A scuzzy guitar punctuates the entire song, Dave Gahan's vocals are \ntweaked, fuzzy, and perfectly demented, and unsettling electronic percolations \nzip back and forth over a slow monotonous beat. Martin Gore's lyrics display a \nstream-of-conscious, almost schizophrenic sense of unease, setting a tone that \nmust have gone over quite easily with a then-veering-out-of-control Gahan. \nDirector Anton Corbijn's creepy music video featured Gahan scrambling around \neasily with false eyes painted on his eyelids, creating a thoroughly appropriate \nvisual metaphor for the song. When &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; was released as a single, \nthere was a general uproar from some longtime fans. They worried out loud, \nhowever ridiculously, that Depeche Mode was jumping on the electronica \nbandwagon. Seeing as how Depeche Mode was from its humble beginning a keyboard \nband, such claims were and are meaningless. The song follows in the same genius, \ngrimy dance-rock tradition the band had almost single-handedly created with such \nclassics as &quot;Behind the Wheel,&quot; &quot;Never Let Me Down Again,&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus.&quot; \nDespite the fact that it seems jarring on the beautiful, restrained Ultra, \n&quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; is vintage Depeche Mode. \n\n\n\nTHE LOVE THIEVES     by Tim DiGravina\n\nWith its references to Jonah, Adam, Eve, and &quot;the wretched disciples,&quot; &quot;The Love \nThieves&quot; is another in a long line of Depeche Mode songs that ties in religious \nimagery with ruminations on love and relationships. Whether or not Christ is the \nprotagonist of the song, it's a warm, tender if uneasy ballad that features some \nof David Gahan's most accomplished vocals. Evelyn Halus was employed during the \nrecording of Ultra to help keep Gahan's drug-damaged voice in check, and with \nthe calming sweet tones Gahan emits here, it seems like money well spent. \nGahan's gentle enunciation and hushed cooing fit nicely over the smooth jazzy \nbeat created by Martin Gore and producer Tim Simenon. It's safe to say that &quot;The \nLove Thieves&quot; features some of Gore's more cumbersome lyrics, but despite this, \nGahan's strong vocals patch up the holes left by Gore's rather awkward \nmetaphors. While Simenon deserves credit for crafting the warm blanket of sound \naround Gahan, &quot;The Love Thieves&quot; isn't Depeche Mode at its best, as one could \nimagine any of a number of bands achieving a similar musical stew. Simenon's \nlush production makes up somewhat for the simple musical arrangement, but the \nloss of Alan Wilder takes its toll. Usually Gahan's voice is on equal footing \nwith Gore's songwriting, but on &quot;The Love Thieves,&quot; Gahan is both the song's \nstar and savior. Even if one praises Gore for allowing Gahan to shine over the \nminimal musical backdrop, it's rare when a Depeche Mode song can be mistaken for \nSpandau Ballet or similar light fare. \n\n\n\nHOME     by Tim DiGravina\n\nJust as vital to any Depeche Mode album as keyboards, emotionally bracing \nsubject matter, and David Gahan's soul-revealing voice are Martin Gore's self-\nsung ballads. With the fragile, sweet &quot;Home,&quot; Gore provides one of Ultra's true \nhighlights. Except for the touching chorus, Gore offers all of his vocals in a \nchoppy, endearing staccato style, punctuating every rhyming word with great \nemphasis. A slow trip-hop beat and subdued background distortion are the musical \nfoundation over which crystalline keyboard melodies and string arrangements \npaint impressionistic drama. Ultimately, &quot;Home&quot; is about Gore finally feeling as \nif he's found his place in life. He professes endearing thanks for the help his \nfriend or lover gave in helping him to feel that he &quot;belongs.&quot; His swooning \ndeclaration of &quot;I should have known from my first breath&quot; seems perhaps his \nleast inhibited vocal delivery, at least up to the release of Ultra. &quot;Home&quot; is \nevery bit as powerful as Gore's more heart-wrenching ballads. That he's able to \nemote so optimistically makes the track a real treat. &quot;Home&quot; is a beautiful, \npositive force that reveals new charms with every listen. \n\n\n\nIT'S NO GOOD     \tby Tim DiGravina\n\nOne could easily question the sequencing of Ultra, because the album reveals \nthree of its strongest tracks in the first four songs. &quot;It's No Good,&quot; along \nwith &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Home,&quot; easily takes its place among Depeche Mode's \nmany classics. Even more than &quot;Barrel of a Gun,&quot; &quot;It's No Good&quot; feels like it \ncould have been a perfect fit on Violator. The song flows with a dark swagger, \nas trademark keyboard/synth sounds that are unmistakably Depeche Mode percolate \nand simmer. Producer Tim Simenon gives the song a glossy shine while still \nallowing for scuzzy percussion from Victor Endrizzio and an undercurrent of \npunchy industrial effects. David Gahan's vocals are bothered but confident, as \nif vocal coach Evelyn Halus has told him to simply relax and let the music flow \nover his voice. Martin Gore's lyrics are rather humorous and deftly to the \npoint: &quot;Don't say you love me, it's understood/Don't say you're happy, out there \nwithout me/I know you can't be, 'cause it's no good.&quot; Gore and Gahan paint the \npicture of a nonchalant lover with loads of patience. It's a kind of emotional \nsecurity that's rare in Depeche Mode's music, as there's not an iota of angst on \ndisplay. It has to be said that Gahan sounds a bit out-of-it during key passages \nin the song. Whether he's channeling his bouts with drug addiction and death is \ndebatable, but his voice is somehow full of irony and irony-free all at once. \n&quot;It's No Good&quot; is a look to the past, through a prism of subtlety and maturity, \nas well as a marvelous injection of attitude on Ultra. Director Anton Corbijn's \nwitty, colorful video for the song, in promotion of Ultra, expertly captured the \nsong's spirit and Gahan's new self-confidence. \n\n\n\nUSELINK     by Tim DiGravina\n\nAnyone doubting Depeche Mode's confidence and artistry need only look to the \nshort instrumental &quot;Uselink.&quot; After horrific world tours, grand interpersonal \ntroubles, and terrifying health and mental scares for everyone in the band, the \nmelodicism and subtlety of Ultra are pure expressions of rejuvenation. And \n&quot;Uselink&quot; is further a purging of accessibility and any sense of artifice. After \nnearly a minute of sci-fi sound effects and moody tones, a slow beat kicks in. A \nminute and a half in, a series of piercing percussive sampler effects paint a \nkind of kabuki abstraction, and then the song ends abruptly. &quot;Uselink&quot; is more \nthan a simple stab at minimalism. It's a cleansing rainfall that declares that, \nwhether it's true or not, Martin Gore and company are just as solid of a unit \nwithout the recently departed Alan Wilder. Producer Tim Simenon probably \ndeserves a great deal of credit for the song's at once rich and basic industrial \ntexture. Gareth Jones steps in as a co-mixer here, and longtime \ncollaborator/guru Daniel Miller treats the loops with a Roland System 700 synth. \nArtsy, icy, and unrelenting, &quot;Uselink&quot; is a fragile piece of dark musical \npoetry. \n\n\n\nUSELESS    by Tim DiGravina\n\nThe fourth and final U.K. single from Ultra, &quot;Useless&quot; blends the moody swagger \nand techno atmosphere of &quot;It's No Good&quot; with an edgy, ominous rock vibe just \nslightly less potent than &quot;Barrel of a Gun.&quot; That the song only reached number \n28 on the U.K. singles chart isn't indicative of its quality, as &quot;Useless&quot; is \nperhaps wound in too many layers of tension for widespread accessibility. \nPerhaps the masses didn't understand the song's mixture of trip-hop vibes and \nsqualid rock guitar sounds. Maybe the song confused longtime fans with its live \nband feel; multiple drummers, a bass player, and a dedicated percussionist make \nit one of the most traditional-sounding rock songs Depeche Mode has ever \nrecorded. One thing that's certain is that David Gahan comes off as entirely \ndisaffected, presenting Martin Gore's acerbic lyrics as thorns on a rose. &quot;All \nyour stupid ideals/you've got your head in the clouds/you should see how it \nfeels/with your feet on the ground,&quot; sings Gahan in the second half of the \nsong's chorus. Gore's songs rarely depict such animosity between lovers or \nfriends, as it's usually a sick world that infringes upon a relationship and not \nthe other way around. Fans of the band might wonder if &quot;Useless&quot; is directed at \nleast partially at Alan Wilder, as interviews after his departure from both \nparties suggested a relationship as bruised as the one depicted in the song. \nBecause of its textural similarity to &quot;It's No Good,&quot; &quot;Useless&quot; was going to be \na hard sell as a single, but it's a song vital to Ultra's musical and thematic \ncohesion. \n\n\n\nSISTER OF NIGHT     by Tim DiGravina\n\nThe darkly atmospheric &quot;Sister of Night&quot; is like a subtle continuation of \n&quot;Little 15.&quot; But where &quot;Little 15&quot; sought musical drama, &quot;Sister of Night&quot; seeks \nemotional drama. Other than the brief piston-like industrial sound effects at \nthe song's beginning and middle section, David Gahan's gentle voice is the focal \npoint. Gahan offers one of his most nuanced performances to date, singing \ndelicately over Martin Gore's more emotionally revealing background vocals. \nOther than Gahan's voice, Tim Simenon's slow beat is perhaps most dominant in \nthe mix. Moaning electronics make for abstraction at the song's conclusion, but \nfor the most part, the frazzled keyboards and synth notes take a backseat to \nGahan. Gore's lyrics are bleak and unsettling, echoing the codependent theme \nthat is his trademark, as longing &quot;returns, giving voice to the flame/calling \nyou through flesh that burns/breaking down your will/to move in for the kill.&quot; \nBut as always, there's a way of dealing with the pain, and Gahan gives the \ninstructions for this healing: &quot;come for me/embrace me/assure me.&quot; &quot;Sister of \nNight&quot; might not be Ultra's high point, but its lush tones and poetic refrains \nare endlessly fascinating. \n\n\n\nJAZZ THIEVES     by Tim DiGravina\n\nHoused behind an extremely appropriate title, &quot;Jazz Thieves&quot; is a crystalline, \nelectronic soundtrack for tension. The short instrumental is crafted of deep \nbass rumbling, digitally altered and warped strings, vibrant xylophone notes, \nand computerized sound washes. While electronic-tinged jazz music had been \ncoming out of the U.K. and the rest of the world for years, a band with the huge \nprofile of Depeche Mode hadn't shown its hand in the genre prior to the release \nof Ultra. Longtime fans might get the creeping suspicion that &quot;Jazz Thieves&quot; is \nan answer to the departed Alan Wilder, especially because it takes on the \nabstract vibes and ambient nature of Wilder's Recoil project. It's almost as if \nMartin Gore is saying, &quot;I've tried my hand at your brand of music, and I'm your \nequal.&quot; Of course, this is just speculation. &quot;Jazz Thieves&quot; is quite charming \nand musically interesting, even if it is a kind of intermission or interlude. \n\n\n\nFREESTATE     by Tim DiGravina\n\nWith its organic percussion, acoustic country guitar base, and lack of \nkeyboards, &quot;Freestate&quot; sees Depeche Mode expanding its musical horizons, and \nMartin Gore's songwriting is, as always, strong enough to take on a new genre. \nHere he seems to channel some of the blues vibes from Songs of Faith and \nDevotion. Producer Tim Simenon steps in with a crunching, living beat, Gore \netches Cure-like expressionistic guitar notes into the air, and David Gahan \noffers up another dose of focused vocals, singing here, as elsewhere on Ultra, \nwith a more refined sense of melody than on many of the band's earlier albums. \nCredit vocal coach Evelyn Halus and engineer Gareth Jones for coaxing such fine \ntones from Gahan's somewhat damaged vocal chords. It's up to individual Depeche \nMode fans to decide if they prefer this new side of Gahan to his wilder past. \nWhile Gahan's voice seems somewhat detached musically and emotionally from the \ncrackle and grind of Simenon's beat, &quot;Freestate&quot; manages to paint a unique \natmosphere beyond the country, trip-hop, rock, and blues genres at its heart. \nThat it's so moody, yet never overbearing, is what makes it a true success, but \nit can't match similar genre-benders like &quot;Condemnation&quot; and &quot;One Caress&quot; when \nit comes to artistry or cohesion. One gets the sense that there's a slight spark \nmissing here, and it's easy to imagine that Alan Wilder would have been able to \nwork some magic or at least create a more potent arrangement. \n\n\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE     by Tim DiGravina\n\nRavishingly beautiful, &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; is perhaps the perfect Martin Gore \nballad. It might very well be Gore's equivalent of Tim Buckley's &quot;Song to the \nSiren.&quot; The music's futuristic electronic sheen and lush, dignified beat and BJ \nCole's marvelous alien pedal steel guitar could not better match Gore's sweet, \nstrong voice. Gore uses a series of similes, from wet cats to burned moths, to \nexpress the obsessive nature of his love, before unleashing the same powerful \nconclusion to each of the song's three primary passages: &quot;I follow you.&quot; The \nsong is at once Gore's ultimate expression of love and his most glaring \ndepiction of codependence. &quot;The sun will shine, the bottom line, I follow you,&quot; \nhe sings with an inhibited, matter-of-fact earnestness. The effect is similar to \nBuckley's lyrics: &quot;Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you&quot; and &quot;Here I \nam/Here I am, waiting to hold you.&quot; Indeed, &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; could quite easily \nbe seen as a blend of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; and Songs of Faith and Devotion's \nstunning &quot;Judas.&quot; Fans of Gore's ballads see &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; as absolute \nbliss. Though it might seem minimal and overly coy to some listeners, &quot;The \nBottom Line&quot; is a tour de force in both structure and execution, and one of \nGore's greatest musical achievements. \n\n\n\nINSIGHT     by Tim DiGravina\n\nThough Dave Gahan's voice might be louder in Tim Simenon and Q's mix, &quot;Insight&quot; \nis for all intents and purposes a duet between Gahan and Martin Gore. Both \nsingers offer up some of the most gorgeous vocals they've ever delivered over a \nsweeping electronic musical backdrop. The song glistens like an abstract, \nindustrial work of art. Twinkling pianos, flanged otherworldly sound effects, \nmystical moaning, a throbbing ominous beat, and crystalline keyboard passages \nmake for a lush musical montage. Lyrically, Gore is rarely as optimistic as he \nis here. &quot;The spirit of love is rising within me, talking to you now, telling \nyou clearly, the fire still burns,&quot; Gore and Gahan harmonize. Gore could very \neasily be presenting the song from his or Gahan's point of view, as both Depeche \nMode mainstays tackled life-threatening addictions (alcohol and heroin \nrespectively) prior to the recording of Ultra. The song's close, where Gahan and \nGore repeat &quot;you've got to give love&quot; ad infinitum, is particularly powerful. \nDisregarding the unlisted closing instrumental &quot;Junior Painkiller,&quot; &quot;Insight&quot; is \na wonderful ending for an album that rejuvenated the career and souls of the \nremaining members of Depeche Mode. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT WIKIPEDIA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBARREL OF A GUN\n\n&quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-first UK single, released on February \n3, 1997 (January 28 in the USA), and the first single from the band's ninth \nstudio album Ultra.\n\n&quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; came after some difficult times for the band and its members. \nMusician Alan Wilder left the band in 1995 and lead singer David Gahan nearly \ndied while in the throes of heroin addiction. Martin Gore had a string of \nseizures, and Andrew Fletcher had some emotional problems of his own. In mid-\n1996 Martin tried to get Dave and Fletch back together by writing a few songs \nand see if anybody was interested in continuing after that. It worked, and the \nband were back together, except now a trio again for the first time since 1982's \nA Broken Frame.\n\n&quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; brings back in the industrial music sound, and is possibly the \ndarkest DM song yet. Martin wasn't sure if this was going to be a big hit on the \nradio, so he was reluctant to recommend this song as the first single, but when \nhe eventually did, it turned out the rest of band, Daniel Miller, and producer \nTim Simenon agreed. It reached #4 in the UK chart in 1997, which at the time was \ntheir joint highest chart position with People Are People released in 1984. \nSince then, Precious has also reached #4 in the UK, in 2005.\n\nThe B-side is a 7+ minute instrumental called &quot;Painkiller&quot;, which is very hard-\nrockish. A condensed (2+ minute) version shows up as a hidden track on the Ultra \nalbum as &quot;Junior Painkiller&quot;.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; is directed by Anton Corbijn, DM's long-\ntime visual collaborator. It features Dave singing with his eyes closed, with \neyeballs drawn on his eyelids to make it seem like they are open. Dave has \nrather amusing commentary on the video on The Videos 86-98. The video was shot \nin Morocco.\n\n\n\nHOME\n\n&quot;Home&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-third UK single, released on June 16, 1997, and \nthe third single for the album Ultra. It is also the third (and most recent) UK \nsingle with Martin Gore on lead vocals, and the second stand-alone single with \nhim on lead vocals (the others are &quot;A Question of Lust&quot; and &quot;Somebody&quot;, which \nwas a double A-side with &quot;Blasphemous Rumours&quot;).\n\nThough it was planned to be released in the US, it ended up being scrapped due \nto some radio stations playing the song &quot;Useless&quot; instead, leading people in the \nUS to believe that was the third single, when it was the fourth single. Reprise \nscrapped the US release of &quot;Home&quot;, despite there already being confirmed \ntracklists, and released &quot;Home&quot;/&quot;Useless&quot; as a double A-side single.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; is a ballad with haunting strings and other arrangements, and as a Martin \nGore vocal track it's a fan favourite. The single version of &quot;Home&quot; has an \nambient intro, then the drum beat featured in the album version, yet is the same \nlength as the album version. There are no actual B-sides for &quot;Home&quot;, just live \nversions of &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot; and &quot;It's No Good&quot; recorded during the Ultra Party \nconcert in London.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Home&quot; is the only Ultra video not directed by Anton \nCorbijn, but instead by Steve Green. It features an alien exploring an apartment \ncomplex, and uses a highly-shortened down version of &quot;Home&quot;.\n\nDuring the &quot;Touring the Angel&quot; world tour, &quot;Home&quot; was included in the setlist, \nand the &quot;Air Around the Golf&quot; arrangement was used for the first half part of \nthe song.\n\n\n\nIT'S NO GOOD\n\n&quot;It's No Good&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-second UK single, released on March 31, \n1997 (April 15 in the USA), and the second single for the then upcoming album \nUltra. It reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n&quot;It's No Good&quot; is a moodily rhythmic, perhaps even &quot;sexy&quot; song with a distinct \nlyrical hook in the chorus:\n\nDon't say you want me\nDon't say you need me\nDon't say you love me\nIt's understood\n\nIt played well on American radio and MTV, and is a favorite live . The &quot;Speedy J \nMix&quot; made it onto Remixes 81 - 04 in 2004, as did the &quot;Club 69 Future Mix&quot; \n(Remix Peter Rauhofer) which was previously promo only.\n\nThe B-side is another instrumental, called &quot;Slowblow&quot;. It was the last actual B\n-side from the Ultra era, making the album the only one by Depeche Mode to not \nhave a non-remix/non-live vocal B-side track (Although if you exclude non-\nexclusive songs, Black Celebration can count as well). The instrumental itself \nis slow and moody.\n\nThe music video for &quot;It's No Good&quot; was directed by Anton Corbijn, depicting the \nband as a low-rent lounge act at a number of sleazy gigs. An alternate video was \nrecorded for &quot;It's No Good&quot; in 2001 as a screen projection for the Exciter Tour.\n\nOn May 15, 1997, the band went on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and performed \nthe song, a recording made available at The official Depeche Mode website. It \nwas the first time they performed a song on an American TV show since 1988, when \nthey performed &quot;Strangelove&quot;. The 'Hardfloor Mix' of the song was featured \nbriefly in the Friends episode, The One with Joey's Dirty Day. &quot;It's No Good&quot; \nwas also used in an episode of Nash Bridges.\n\n\n\nUSELESS\n\n&quot;Useless&quot; is Depeche Mode's thirty-fourth UK single, released on October 20, \n1997, and the fourth and final single for the album Ultra. It was released with \n&quot;Home&quot; as a double A-side in the US due to &quot;Useless&quot; getting airplay on US radio \nstations before &quot;Home&quot; was announced.\n\n&quot;Useless&quot; is a hard-rock track in the vein of &quot;Barrel of a Gun&quot;, with more of a \npop twist. The single remix, by Alan Moulder, changes the intro and has an \nupdated beat (similar to the changes done to the 7&quot; versions of &quot;Walking In My \nShoes&quot; and &quot;Condemnation&quot;) and adds some extra synth during the chorus. The &quot;The \nKruder + Dorfmeister Session&quot; is a very prominent remix by the DJ duo of the \nsame name. On the US single, the single remix is replaced by the CJ Bolland \nUltrasonar Edit.\n\nThere are no actual B-sides for &quot;Useless&quot;, except for remixes and live versions \nof the song. Some versions of the CD single feature the videos for &quot;Barrel of a \nGun&quot; and &quot;It's No Good&quot;, accessible when the disc is inserted into a PC.\n\nThe 1997 music video for &quot;Useless&quot; would be the last Depeche Mode video to be \ndirected by Anton Corbijn in over eight years. Though he still did some work for \nDepeche Mode on album/single covers and tour projections/designs, the band \ndecided to experiment with new directors for music videos. Corbijn's next \nproject with Depeche Mode was the video for &quot;Suffer Well&quot;.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:914d958516702939247d559bcd6a5ed0218cf822","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Ultra+%28Remaster+2007%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"914d958516702939247d559bcd6a5ed0218cf822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,77,149,133,22,112,41,57,36,125,85,155,205,106,94,208,33,140,248,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
