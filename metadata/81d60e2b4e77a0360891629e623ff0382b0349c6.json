A portion of the proceeds in the US will benefit the VH1 Save The Music Foundation. \n\nNettwerk and VH1 Save The Music initially teamed up in 2002 around the release of the first For The Kids album with a goal of creating a children's album that would be just as enjoyable for adults as for kids. The response was overwhelming - notes and emails from parents and teachers across the country and fantastic reviews poured in. Nettwerk was inspired by the response and decided to release For The Kids Too in 2004. Three years later, both albums continue to be parent favorites and still end up on &quot;best of&quot; lists. \n\n2002 For The Kids\n2004 For The Kids Too\n2007 For The Kids Three\n\nFor The Kids\n1. \t Cake: Mahna Mahna\t \n2. \t Barenaked Ladies: La La La La Lemon\t \n3. \t Sarah McLachlan: The Rainbow Connection\t \n4. \t Guster: I've Got To Be Clean\t \n5. \t Dan Zanes: Wonderwheel\t \n6. \t Glen Phillips: Have A Little Fun\t \n7. \t Five For Fighting: The Hoppity Song\t \n8. \t Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco: My Flying Saucer\t \n9. \t Darius Rucker: It's All Right To Cry\t \n10. \t Ivy: Sing\t \n11. \t Remy Zero: Bright Eyes\t \n12. \t Dan Wilson: Willie The King\t \n13. \t Bleu: Snow Day\t \n14. \t Chantal &amp; Raine Maida: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\t \n15. \t Sixpence None The Richer: Goodnight Children Everywhere\t \n16. \t Tom Waits: Bend Down The Branches\n\nFor The Kids Too\n1. \t Butterfly Boucher: I'm Different\t \n2. \t David Mead: I Like To Run I Like To Jump\t \n3. \t Ralph's World: At The Bottom Of The Sea\t \n4. \t Ambrosia Parsley: Everybody Came\t \n5. \t Lisa Loeb: Catch The Moon\t \n6. \t Matt Nathanson: Starfish And Coffee\t \n7. \t They Might Be Giants: John Lee Supertaster\t \n8. \t Jason Mraz: The Rainbow Connection\t \n9. \t Sarah Harmer: Peanut Butter Toast\t \n10. \t Paper Moon: Your Attitude Towards Cuttlefish\t \n11. \t Robyn Hitchcock: I Often Dream Of Trains\t \n12. \t Nathan: My Favourite Things\t \n13. \t Ron Sexsmith: The Very First Day\t \n14. \t Nada Surf: Meow Meow Lullabye\t \n15. \t Matthew Sweet: Goodnight Moon\t \n16. \t Kirsty Hawkshaw: Telephone Song\n\nFor The Kids Three\n1. \t Of Montreal: I Want To Have Fun\t \n2. \t Great Lake Swimmers: See You On The Moon\t \n3. \t Over the Rhine: The Poopsmith Song\t \n4. \t Rogue Wave: My Little Bird\t \n5. \t O.A.R.: Itsy Bitsy Spider\t \n6. \t Barenaked Ladies: The Other Day I Met A Bear\t \n7. \t Dar Williams: The Babysitter's Here\t \n8. \t The Sippy Cups: I'm A Believer\t \n9. \t Anathallo: If You're Happy And You Know It\t \n10. \t The Format: Does Your Cat Have A Mustache?\t \n11. \t Moby feat.
