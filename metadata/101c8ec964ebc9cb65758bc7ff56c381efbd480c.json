Vol 11 v2.11\nPhoto/Info DVD-Rom (Version 11, 14th March 2010)\n\nThis collection has taken 12 years to put together.\nI started it in the 1998.\n\nThis disc contains EVERY photo of Syd Barrett &amp; the early\nPink Floyd I could find in the best quality possible &amp; piles\nof CD inlays &amp; text files. Most of the photos have been\nrenamed to show where it's from and, in case of multiple\ncopies of the same photo, named so that you know that.\n(I.E. 2 versions of the same pic from 'Junkyard' photo shoot\nare called JunkyardSyd2aCol.jpg &amp; JunkyardSyd2bCol.jpg.)\n\nSometimes I couldn't decide which was the best out of 4\ndifferent sources of the same photo so you've got four\ndifferent versions (called a,b,c &amp; d or l,2,3 &amp; 4), but the file\nname's the same so you know it's the same photo. One may have\nricher more realistic colours, whereas another may be sharper.\n\nThere are no photos of the Floyd after Syd left. This is\neverything to do with Syd &amp; his time in Pink Floyd &amp; his\nsolo career.\n\nAlso included are various interesting videos &amp; other\nsurprises.\n\nEverything's set out in proper folders, photo sessions put\nback together, interviews grouped together, art work etc.\nIt's still not complete, never will be, new pics will be\nturning up still every now &amp; again but here is everything\nI have found.\n\nWARNING: EVERYTHING I have found is here, that includes\nitems that some people may find distasteful. Photos of Roger\n'Syd' Barrett taken without his consent during his 'after\nfame' period, the 'Syd's First Trip' video clip &amp; the l998\n'Stalker' footage. If you are offended by these, then please do\nnot view them.\n\nThis collection was requested by the managers of the Syd\nBarrett Estate in order to produce the official website.\n\nPLEASE if you have anything that is missing from this disc\nor an upgrade to a photo already on it then send it to me to\nthe e-mail address below so that it can be added to further\nupdated editions:\n\nemail: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0f626e7d646560616a7c633638404f6d7b66617b6a7d616a7b216c6062&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThanks &amp; I hope you enjoy it,\n\nMark Jones,\nManchester,\nMarch 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101c8ec964ebc9cb65758bc7ff56c381efbd480c","amp;dn":"HYGIY+Vol+11+v2.11","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101c8ec964ebc9cb65758bc7ff56c381efbd480c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,28,142,201,100,235,201,203,101,117,139,199,255,86,195,129,239,189,72,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
