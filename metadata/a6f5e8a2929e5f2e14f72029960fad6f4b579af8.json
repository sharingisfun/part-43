Was she unhappy with Van Dyke ParksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ fluid, orchestral-jazz arrangements on the latter? Did she just want to give some alternate possibilities their day in court? WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just have to go with GeorgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own disclaimer that this is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnot a regular albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and take it at face value. Certainly the tunes that are reprised from An Invitation sound shockingly different when trading in their lush, string-laden settings for quirky art-pop. They also sound very much of a piece with the other tracks here, like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCaptured,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which mates GeorgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s elongated melodic phrases with gooey analog synth tones and Beach Boys-like backing-vocal counterpoint, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreedy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ where her plaintive croon is accompanied by little more than some muted piano chords and a distant atmospheric keyboard backdrop. And while Accidental Experimental seems unlikely to alienate The Bird and the Bee fans, it definitely represents yet another side of GeorgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musical personality.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f5e8a2929e5f2e14f72029960fad6f4b579af8","amp;dn":"Inara+George...+Accidental+Experimental%282009%29%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f5e8a2929e5f2e14f72029960fad6f4b579af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,245,232,162,146,158,95,46,20,247,32,41,150,15,173,111,75,87,154,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
