The three daughters of Christian TschÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ll, the court glass maker, visit the three friends. Two of the girls are in love with Schubert's roommates, and the third, Hannerl, is chaperoning her sisters. More of Schubert's friends come to visit. The father arrives in search of his daughters. Schubert's two roommates drink with TschÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ll in their courtyard, underneath a Lilac tree, and he agrees to their engagements with his daughters. Schubert takes on Hannerl as his singing pupil, and although the two fall in love, they are each too shy to reveal their feelings.\n\nA couple of months later, the first two daughters are marrying their fiances at TschÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ll's house, and the three roommates are all guests at the wedding. Actress Giuditta Grisi, the mistress of Baron Franz Schober, one of Schubert's friends, arrives. She is jealous and believes that he must be cheating on her. She assumes that Hannerl is the other woman and warns her to stay away from her man. Schubert, still too unable to tell Hannerl that he loves her, instead asks Schober to sing a song that he has written for her (&quot;Ungeduld&quot;). Hannerl misunderstands Grisi's warning, believing it to be about Schubert rather than Schober. She turns away from the composer and falls in love with Schober.\n\nIn the Prater the following morning, everyone assembles. Eventually, Schubert ends up alone, disappointed, but consoled by Hannerl's happiness and by his music.\n\n\nDirected by\n\nErnst Marischka\t \t\n \nWriting credits \n\nHeinrich Berte\t \tbook\nErnst Marischka\t \twriter\nHeinz Reichert\t \tbook\nA.M.
