The box set is available as seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick. The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts.\n\n\nThe box set contains all six albums and one live E.P. recorded by Radiohead for their former label EMI between 1993 and 2003:\n\n    * Pablo Honey\n    * The Bends\n    * OK Computer\n    * Kid A\n    * Amnesiac\n    * I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\n    * Hail to the Thief\n\n\n\nReview\n\nby Andy Kellman\n\nThis simple, attractive, reasonably priced box set (issued in the U.K.) houses 1993's Pablo Honey, 1995's The Bends, 1997's OK Computer, 2000's Kid A, 2001's Amnesiac and I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings, and 2003's Hail to the Thief -- each full-length Radiohead release on Parlophone. (The label released the box, marketed as &quot;limited edition,&quot; between Radiohead's pick-your-price download and physical release of In Rainbows.) Each disc is in its own sturdy, foldout digipack sleeve, containing the original artwork in full, and they fit into a black sheath that slides snugly into a white box. No remastering took place with any of the recordings.\n- http://www.allmusic.com/album/radiohead-box-set-r1267579\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\nCD 1 - Pablo Honey \n01 - You - 3:29\n02 - Creep - 3:56\n03 - How Do You? - 2:12\n04 - Stop Whispering - 5:26\n05 - Thinking About You - 2:42\n06 - Anyone Can Play Guitar - 3:38\n07 - Ripcord - 3:10\n08 - Vegetable - 3:13\n09 - Prove Yourself - 2:25\n10 - I Can't - 4:13\n11 - Lurgee - 3:08\n12 - Blow Out - 4:42\n\nCD 2 - The Bends \n01 - Planet Telex - 4:19\n02 - The Bends - 4:06\n03 - High And Dry - 4:18\n04 - Fake Plastic Trees - 4:51\n05 - Bones - 3:09\n06 - (Nice Dream) - 3:53\n07 - Just - 3:54\n08 - My Iron Lung - 4:36\n09 - Bullet Proof.. - I Wish I Was - 3:29\n10 - Black Star - 4:07\n11 - Sulk - 3:43\n12 - Street Spirit (Fade Out) - 4:14\n\nCD 3 - OK Computer \n01 - Airbag - 4:44\n02 - Paranoid Android - 6:24\n03 - Subterranean Homesick Alien - 4:28\n04 - Exit Music (For A Film) - 4:25\n05 - Let Down - 4:59\n06 - Karma Police - 4:22\n07 - Fitter Happier - 1:57\n08 - Electioneering - 3:51\n09 - Climbing Up The Walls - 4:45\n10 - No Surprises -3:49\n11 - Lucky - 4:20\n12 - The Tourist - 5:27\n\nCD 4 - Kid A \n01 - Everything In Its Right Place - 4:11\n02 - Kid A - 4:45\n03 - The National Anthem - 5:52\n04 - How To Disappear Completely - 5:56\n05 - Treefingers - 3:43\n06 - Optimistic - 5:16\n07 - In Limbo - 3:31\n08 - Idioteque - 5:09\n09 - Morning Bell - 4:36\n10 - Motion Picture Soundtrack - 7:01\n\nCD 5 - Amnesiac \n01 - Pack Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box - 4:00\n02 - Pyramid Song - 4:49\n03 - Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors - 4:07\n04 - You And Whose Army? - 3:11\n05 - I Might Be Wrong - 4:54\n06 - Knives Out - 4:15\n07 - Morning Bell/Amnesiac - 3:14\n08 - Dollars &amp; Cents - 4:52\n09 - Hunting Bears - 2:01\n10 - Like Spinning Plates - 3:57\n11 - Life In A Glasshouse - 4:37\n\nCD 6 - I Might Be Wrong (Live Recordings) \n01 - The National Anthem - 4:58\n02 - I Might Be Wrong - 4:52\n03 - Morning Bell - 4:14\n04 - Like Spinning Plates - 3:47\n05 - Idioteque - 4:25\n06 - Everything In Its Right Place - 7:43\n07 - Dollars &amp; Cents - 5:13\n08 - True Love Waits - 5:05\n\nCD 7 - Hail to the Thief \n01 - 2 + 2 = 5 (The Lukewarm.) - 3:19 \n02 - Sit down.
