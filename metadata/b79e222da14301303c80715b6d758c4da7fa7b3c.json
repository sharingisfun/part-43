This was done at the insistence of their then-label, Roadrunner Records, because there was a song called &quot;'Amon' Belongs to 'Them'&quot; on the King Diamond album, &quot;Conspiracy.&quot;\n\nWe at TTU upload music we like to listen to and with promotional purposes only,if you like the album,buy it,thats what we need to keep metal alive!!If you have any requests for new,old,rare,metal from any country,PM me or leave a comment!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/images/1/4/8/148_photo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/images/1/4/8/148_photo.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww290/mamieshaw/morkBlasphemy.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i728.photobucket.com/albums/ww290/mamieshaw/morkBlasphemy.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6576/194034449820561022.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img507.imageshack.us/img507/6576/194034449820561022.gif&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b79e222da14301303c80715b6d758c4da7fa7b3c","amp;dn":"Deicide+-+To+Hell+With+God+%282011%29+-+%7BBlasphemy%7D+TTU+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b79e222da14301303c80715b6d758c4da7fa7b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,158,34,45,161,67,1,48,60,128,113,91,109,117,140,77,167,250,123,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
