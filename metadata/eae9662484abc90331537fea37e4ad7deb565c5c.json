Hole runs through a dizzying array of licks and solos, pulling out a variety of different tones and textures from his guitar. He can play it straight and greasy, or spooky, tough and gritty, or subtle and melodic -- his technique is quite impressive. Although the songs themselves are occasionally weak, Short Fuse Blues is essentially a guitar record, so the songs don't matter as much as the playing. And the playing is superb throughout. ~ Thom Owens\n\n\nTracklist\n1  Keep Your Motor Running \n2  The Bottle \n3  Short Fuse Blues \n4  Every Girl I See \n5  Something Fine \n6  Albatross \n7  Night Cat \n8 Tore Down \n9 The Sun Is Shinning \n10 Business Man \n11 Take A Swing \n12 Dark Was The Night (Cold Was The Ground) \n13 Truckload Of Lovin' \n14 Purple Haze\n\nRecorded at Planet Studios, Perth, Australia\n\nPersonnel: Dave Hole (guitar, vocals), Bob Patient (keyboards), John &quot;Hambone&quot; Wilson (bass), Ronnie &quot;Greystple&quot; Parker (drums, percussion).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae9662484abc90331537fea37e4ad7deb565c5c","amp;dn":"Dave+Hole+Short+Fuse+Blues%28rock+blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogerc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eae9662484abc90331537fea37e4ad7deb565c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,233,102,36,132,171,201,3,49,83,127,234,55,228,173,125,235,86,92,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
