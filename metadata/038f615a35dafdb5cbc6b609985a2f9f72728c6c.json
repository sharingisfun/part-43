In a joint project with The New York Times, Bergman and the Times talk to industry insiders, lobbyists, politicians and consumer advocates as they square off over new regulation and the possible creation of a consumer finance protection agency.  How are the credit, debit and pre-paid card industries repositioning themselves to maintain high profits under the new rules?  The stakes couldn't be higher as many fear the consumer loan industry could be at the center of the next crisis.\n\nGeneral           : PBS Frontline-The Card Game.S28E05.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 22s 616ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 005 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 135 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:038f615a35dafdb5cbc6b609985a2f9f72728c6c","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline-The+Card+Game.S28E05.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"038f615a35dafdb5cbc6b609985a2f9f72728c6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,143,97,90,53,218,253,181,203,198,182,9,152,90,47,159,114,114,140,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
