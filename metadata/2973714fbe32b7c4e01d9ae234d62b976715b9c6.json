It is an entertaining way to get the message out. The\nCowichan Citizens Coalition and its &quot;Duncan Initiative&quot; received high\npraise from those who previewed it. I recommend it as a painless but\nhard-hitting educational tool and encourage the widest distribution and\nuse by all groups concerned with the present unsustainable monetary \nsystem in Canada and the United States.\n\nOfficial Website: www.moneyasdebt.net\n\nXvid (Perian), 688 x 512, Millions\nMPEG Layer 3, Stereo, 48.000 kHz\n1014.76 kbits/s\n0:00:47:07.29\n\n\nEllen Brown - Web of Debt (FED).pdf\n\nThrough a network of anonymous financial spider webbing only a\nhandful of global King Bankers own and control it all. . . . Everybody,\npeople, enterprise, State and foreign countries, all have become slaves\nchained to the BankerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s credit ropes.\n-- Hans Schicht, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Death of BankingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (February 2005)\n\nPresident Andrew Jackson called the banking cartel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa hydraheaded\nmonster eating the flesh of the common man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ New\nYork Mayor John Hylan, writing in the 1920s, called it a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgiant octopusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nthat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œseizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers,\nour legislative bodies, our schools, our courts, our newspapers, and\nevery agency created for the public protection.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The debt spider has\ndevoured farms, homes and whole countries that have become trapped\nin its web.\n\nIn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Death of Banking,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ financial commentator Hans Schicht\nstates that he had an opportunity in his career to observe the wizards\nof finance as an insider at close range. Their game, he says, has gotten\nso centralized and concentrated that the greater part of U.S. banking\nand enterprise is now under the control of a small inner circle of men.\nHe calls the game ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspider webbing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Its rules include:\n\n\n***Making any concentration of wealth invisible.\n\n***Exercising control through ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œleverageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mergers, takeovers, chain\nshare holdings where one company holds shares of other\ncompanies, conditions annexed to loans, and so forth.\n\n***Exercising tight personal management and control, with a\nminimum of insiders and front-men who themselves have only\npartial knowledge of the game.\n\n\nDr. Carroll Quigley was a writer and professor of history at\nGeorgetown University, where he was President Bill ClintonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mentor.\n\nProfessor Quigley wrote from personal knowledge of an elite clique of\nglobal financiers bent on controlling the world. Their aim, he said,\nwas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnothing less than to create a world system of financial control\nin private hands able to dominate the political system of each country\nand the economy of the world as a whole.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This system was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œto be\ncontrolled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world\nacting in concert, by secret agreements.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He called this clique simply\nthe ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinternational bankers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Their essence was not race, religion or\nnationality but was just a passion for control over other humans. The\nkey to their success was that they would control and manipulate the money\nsystem of a nation while letting it appear to be controlled by the government.\n\nThe international bankers have succeeded in doing more than just\ncontrolling the money supply. Today they actually create the money\nsupply, while making it appear to be created by the government. This\ndevious scheme was revealed by Sir Josiah Stamp, director of the Bank\nof England and the second richest man in Britain in the 1920s. Speaking\nat the University of Texas in 1927, he dropped this bombshell:\n\nThe modern banking system manufactures money out of nothing.\nThe process is perhaps the most astounding piece of sleight of\nhand that was ever invented. Banking was conceived in inequity\nand born in sin . . . . Bankers own the earth. Take it away from\nthem but leave them the power to create money, and, with a\nflick of a pen, they will create enough money to buy it back\nagain. . . . Take this great power away from them and all great\nfortunes like mine will disappear, for then this would be a better\nand happier world to live in. . . . But, if you want to continue to be\nthe slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, then let\nbankers continue to create money and control credit.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2973714fbe32b7c4e01d9ae234d62b976715b9c6","amp;dn":"Paul.Grignon_Money.as.Debt.XviD%2BEllen.Brown.PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2973714fbe32b7c4e01d9ae234d62b976715b9c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,115,113,79,190,50,183,196,224,29,154,226,52,214,43,151,103,21,185,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
