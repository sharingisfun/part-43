The tracks are untitled to protect the\n\nintegrity of the cue sheet.\n\nThe is the 3nd disc of a 6 disc limited edition set. I have scanned the cover which is the same for\n\nfront and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page\n\nbook that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad\n\nenough then buy the box set. I will upload one disc a day. This set is a combination of the soundtrack\n\nand follow up album with the exception Ten Years After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the\n\nFish.\n\nPease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete versions that were unissued. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.\n\nPlease help seed these torrents.
