It's in glorious, creepy, moody, suspenseful black and white.\n\nThis file was encoded from a DVD rip to mp4 using Nero Recode.  The file is in Nero Digital standard AVC, which is an mp4 file that is made with the H.264 codec.  The audio is 2 channel, high efficiency AAC, and 48 kHz.  The fields have been de-interlaced.  I tested the file, and it will definitely play on Nero Showtime, Quicktime, and Media Player Classic (theoretically, any player that supports .mp4).
