Granny Torrelli's tales are laced with endearing, fun-to-say Italian: &quot;I didn't like it, not one piccolino bit,&quot; as is her attempt to help Rosie mend her rift with her best friend Bailey (&quot;That Bailey boy!&quot;), for whom she's starting to feel more-than-friendship feelings.\n\nThe details of both Rosie's and Granny Torrelli's respective stories are often quite funny (from Braille jealousy to secret guide-dog training for the legally blind Bailey). But, as usual, what Creech does best is slyly proffer small, nourishing morsels of wisdom--not unlike the cavatelli, the &quot;little dough canoes,&quot; that Rosie, Granny Torrelli, and that Bailey boy labor over in the book's sweet second half. Just be warned that you might find yourself starving by the end of the story. (Ages 9 to 12) --Paul Hughes ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c0d688e703d69806e3c6b655cd769f88e9a07b","amp;dn":"Granny+Torrelli+Makes+Soup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c0d688e703d69806e3c6b655cd769f88e9a07b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,192,214,136,231,3,214,152,6,227,198,182,85,205,118,159,136,233,160,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
