Prabhakar Rao has vast experience as a teacher, administrator and\nclinical biochemist. Though there are several textbooks in Biochemistry written by Indian authors,\nthis book differs from others in that it comprises of questions and answers in all aspects of Biochemistry.\nAlmost all the commonly asked questions in viva voce examination in Biochemistry are covered by the\nauthor. Subjects like metabolism of xenobiotics, biochemistry of cancer and clinical biochemistry\nwhich are of biomedical importance are also covered in a lucid and simplified manner. This textbook\nwhich is a compendium of questions and answers in all topics of Biochemistry is not a substitute for a\ntextbook of medical Biochemistry but certainly is an adjuvant to it. This book is useful not only to\nundergraduate and post-graduate students in Biochemistry in India but is also useful to those preparing\nfor other examinations in other countries.\nI earnestly hope that this book will receive appreciation from students and teachers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91533d1cc7da6f9e0a8b0a3975c9120866797785","amp;dn":"Viva_Voce_Orals_in_Biochemistry.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91533d1cc7da6f9e0a8b0a3975c9120866797785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,83,61,28,199,218,111,158,10,139,10,57,117,201,18,8,102,121,119,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
