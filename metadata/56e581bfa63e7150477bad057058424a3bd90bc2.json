Granted they were still more competent and enthusiastic at their specialty than most of their competition, and they did expand their recorded sound a bit by using some members of Roomful of Blues on sax and piano.  Ultimately, though, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an average if well-done set of roots rock with strong echoes of the blues, New Orleans R&amp;B, and swamp-pop. The programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s split between Kim Wilson originals (one of which, 'OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Too Many,' was co-written with Nick Lowe) and covers, including an unpredictable version of 'Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White.'  Actually the highlight is the instrumental 'In Orbit,' which features excellent Little Walter-styled harmonica by Wilson.  The 2000 CD reissue on Benchmark adds liner notes by producer Denny Bruce and three bonus tracks, although no details about the extra cuts are provided. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide\n\nThe Fabulous Thunderbirds - Butt RockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Tracklist:\n01  I Believe IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m in Love Wilson 2:28\n02  OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Too Many (And a Hundred AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Enough) Lowe, Wilson 2:39\n03  Give Me All Your LovinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Wilson 2:47\n04  Roll, Roll, Roll Baker, Shuler 3:09\n05  Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White David, Leonardi, Louiguy 1:59\n06  I Hear You KnockinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Miller 2:45\n07  Tip on In Holmes, Moore 3:40\n08  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Sorry Wilson 2:50\n09  Mathilda Khoury, Thierry 3:17\n10  Tell Me Why Wilson 2:26\n11  In Orbit Buck, Ferguson, Vaughan  4:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e581bfa63e7150477bad057058424a3bd90bc2","amp;dn":"The+Fabulous+Thunderbirds+-+Butt+Rockin%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%84%A2+%281981%29+%5BTexas+Blues%5D%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e581bfa63e7150477bad057058424a3bd90bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,229,129,191,166,62,113,80,71,123,173,5,112,88,66,74,59,217,11,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
