The label includes and features such blues/rock artist as Walter Trout, Jay Hooks, Michel Katon and Carl Verheyen. Shortly after releasing this CD, Omar left and joined Blind Pig. &quot;Screamin' Cat&quot; is a swampy New Orleans blues/rock mix much in the style of the band Iko-Iko. On this particular release, Omar is joined by Papa Mali (CD &quot;Thunder Chicken&quot;) and Papa's drummer Barry &quot;Frosty&quot; Smith, who add that critical bayou beat to the mix. Mali contributes on the slide guitar, dobro and baritone guitars, as well as theB-3 organ, while Frosty weighs in on the drums, percussion, B-3 organ and key bass. Omar's vocals on this release are a bit gravely and very similar to Dr. John's. All of the tunes are upbeat and full of energy. From a musical and technical perspective, there is not a bad track on the disc.
