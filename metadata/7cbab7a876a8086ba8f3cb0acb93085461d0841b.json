From a review of the record in Goldmine...&quot;Not just a tired string of random selections; but an album that hangs together alarmingly well as a full length listen and proves beyond a doubt that Ridgway's efforts over the past decade make him deserving of recognition as one of the most consistently imaginative songwriting talents.&quot; 16 tracks. \n\n\nNot another album to listen to in West Texas, long after dark, when the rest of the world slumbers...... Stan's tales of the bleak side of humanity will transport you far beyond the lonesome cattle traces to somewhwere you may not want to go.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nStewart Copeland - multi instruments\nMarc Ribot - electric guitar \nTori Amos - background vocals \nJoe Chemay - background vocals \nBeth Andersen - background vocals\nGregg Arreguin - electric guitar\nJohn Batdorf - background vocals\nJim Haas - background vocals\nKen Jones - keyboards\nJon Joyce - background vocals \nPhil Kenzie - saxophone\nTim Landers - fretless bass, acoustic bass\nJim Lang - acoustic bass, keyboards, hammond organ, drum programming\nYvonne Williams - background vocals\nK.
