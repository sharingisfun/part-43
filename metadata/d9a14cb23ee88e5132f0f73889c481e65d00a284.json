Home in a Hive 1:24 \n\nJames Apollo's third studio album follows 2003's Sweet Unknown and 2006's Good Grief by starting off minimal and downbeat, like Nick Cave composing a funeral lament for a lost cowboy. Slow, delicate, with fragile acoustic twangs vying for centre stage with Apollo's distinctive vocals, the song builds to a gentle crescendo before you've noticed, enticing you in and trapping you at the campfire.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/14/james-apollo-2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/14/james-apollo-2/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a14cb23ee88e5132f0f73889c481e65d00a284","amp;dn":"James+Apollo...Hide+Your+Heart+in+a+Hive%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9a14cb23ee88e5132f0f73889c481e65d00a284","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,161,76,178,62,232,142,81,50,240,247,56,137,196,129,230,93,0,162,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
