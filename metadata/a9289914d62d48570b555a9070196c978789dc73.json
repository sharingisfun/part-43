Kicking Off With The Poppy First Single &quot;Let's Dance&quot; The Temperature Rises Further With &quot;Rock The Party&quot;, Dips Part Way Through With The Smoochy &quot;Feel The Love&quot; But Then Climaxes Again In True Five Album Fashion With The Finale &quot;C'mon C'mon&quot;. Kingsize Crackers Are &quot;Closer To Me&quot; A Swinging, Westlife-Style Ballad Which Is Destined To Become A Hit In Its Own Right And &quot;Let's Get It On&quot; A More Mid-Tempo Number.
