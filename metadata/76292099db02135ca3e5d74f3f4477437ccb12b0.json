It may have \n\nsomething to do with the fact that he's working an old-school sound. At a \n\npoint in time when most acoustic guitar-strumming troubadours are tricking \n\nup their tunes with neo-psychedelic swirls, electronic frippery, or some other \n\nsuch device, Pug plays it straight-ahead, with a delivery that brings to mind \n\nJohn Prine, and lyrics full of poetic but never overripe imagery. If Messenger \n\nhad arrived sometime in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s, Pug would likely have been one of the many \n\nsongsmiths of that era (Loudon Wainwright III, Steve Forbert, et al) labeled \n\nas a &quot;New Dylan.&quot; Many of the tracks here feature nothing but Pug \n\naccompanying himself on acoustic guitar, but the songs themselves are weighty \n\nenough that there's never a feeling of empty space. For that matter, even when \n\nPug has a full band backing him up, as on the tunes that bookend the album, \n\n&quot;Messenger&quot; and &quot;Speak Plainly, Diana,&quot; you get the impression that however \n\nmuch the musicians may add, the man up front could easily keep your \n\ninterest all by himself on these cuts as well. &quot;I was born into a circus, but I ran \n\noff to join a home&quot; sings Pug on &quot;How Good You Are,&quot; and it's a perfect \n\nexample of how he can subvert clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s and come up with striking images \n\nwithout ever letting the seams show. It doesn't hurt that Pug brings an \n\nemotional accessibility to these tunes without seeming over-indulgent and \n\nemoting all over your shoes. On his first album, Pug already seems like an old \n\nhand at this game, even if he's exaggerating a touch when he brags &quot;I wrote \n\nJohn Steinbeck's book&quot; on &quot;Not So Sure.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/joe-pug/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/joe-pug/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76292099db02135ca3e5d74f3f4477437ccb12b0","amp;dn":"Joe+Pug...Messenger%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76292099db02135ca3e5d74f3f4477437ccb12b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,41,32,153,219,2,19,92,163,229,215,79,63,68,119,67,124,203,18,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
