I testify that\nthere is none worthy of worship except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His\nslave and Messenger, may Allaah exalt his mention as well as that of his\nfamily and all his companions.\n\n  The world is not only densely populated but it is also saturated with different religions in various concepts. Everyone claims that he has a message to rescue the world and that he is the only one who is on the right path - each one asserting as if everybody owns the franchise to the truth! \nFaced with such a fact, it is imperative upon us, as Muslims, to know the features of our religion. This is for us to determine our position, as well as, to properly conduct and guard ourselves against the other ones that may either be of divine roots such as Christianity and Judaism or of human origin like Buddhism and Hinduism. Otherwise, we will succumb to a plethora of religions. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c7bf42ca10e581b8f85c4bbba27f4af804b4f1","amp;dn":"Islam%5C%27s+features","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c7bf42ca10e581b8f85c4bbba27f4af804b4f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,199,191,66,202,16,229,129,184,248,92,75,187,162,127,74,248,4,180,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
