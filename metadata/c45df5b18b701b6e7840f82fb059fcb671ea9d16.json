A paperback edition in the US by Dell books in 1953 changed the title \n\nagain to An Overdose of Death. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and \n\nsixpence (7/6)[1] while the United States edition retailed at $2.00[2].\n\nIt is one of several of Christie's crime fiction novels to feature both the Belgian \n\ndetective Hercule Poirot, and Chief Inspector Japp. This is Japp's final novel \n\nappearance.\n\n\n                                      Plot\n\n\nWhen Hercule PoirotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own dentist, Henry Morley, is found dead from a gun shot wound, \n\nthe official verdict is that he has killed himself; a verdict apparently supported \n\nwhen it appears that he has given one of his patients a fatal overdose of \n\nanaesthetic. Poirot suspects, however, that there is more to the case than at first \n\nappears, and soon events confirm his worst suspicions.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c45df5b18b701b6e7840f82fb059fcb671ea9d16","amp;dn":"Agatha+Christie%28Queen+Of+Crime%29+-+One+Two+Buckle+My+Shoe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c45df5b18b701b6e7840f82fb059fcb671ea9d16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,93,245,177,139,112,27,110,120,64,248,47,176,89,252,182,113,234,157,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
