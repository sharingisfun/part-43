After drug problems and internal dissension nearly destroyed the group, Aerosmith mounted a spectacular comeback in the 1980s. Despite a considerably more commercially slick and power-ballad oriented sound than theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d first emerged with, frequently drawing on outside songwriters, they managed to became even more popular the second time around.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\n\n\nBig Ones serves up the hits and nothing but the hits; Aerosmith's excellent debut for Geffen, Done with Mirrors, is conveniently overlooked. So what's left is some of the finest mainstream hard rock of the late '80s and early '90s -- the fruits of one of the most remarkable comebacks in rock &amp; roll history. Unfortunately, there's precious little of the classic Aerosmith raunch; in fact, the two new tracks are the hardest, slinkiest tracks here. Otherwise, the up-tempo tracks bog down in over-production (&quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;), and the frequently embarrassingly overwrought power ballads (&quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;) dominate too much of the album. So what's left? The band's best stab at social commentary (&quot;Janie's Got a Gun&quot;), a sublime slinky throwaway (&quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot;), deliciously sleazy blues-rockers (&quot;Rag Doll,&quot; &quot;[Dude] Looks Like a Lady&quot;), and their best ballads (&quot;What It Takes&quot; and &quot;Cryin'&quot;).\n\n\n01.Walk On Water\n02.Love In An Elevator\n03.Rag Doll\n04.What It Takes\n05.Dude (Looks Like A Lady)\n06.Janie's Got A Gun\n07.Cryin'\n08.Amazing\n09.Blind Man\n10.Deuces Are Wild\n11.The Other Side\n12.Crazy\n13.Eat The Rich\n14.Angel\n15.Livin' On The Edge\n16.Dude (Looks Like A Lady) (Live)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778867bf1312fabba0bf249149f0336c8192bb9a","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Big+Ones+%281994%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778867bf1312fabba0bf249149f0336c8192bb9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,136,103,191,19,18,250,187,160,191,36,145,73,240,51,108,129,146,187,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
