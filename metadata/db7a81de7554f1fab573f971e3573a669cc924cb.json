It's a moot point whether it did, but this second of two studio albums produced by West, Bruce &amp; Laing was greatly neglected, as they broke up virtually upon or even prior to its' release.\n\n\n\nThe album features a black-and-white comic strip on its front and back covers depicting the alleged &quot;turn-ons&quot; of the band's members - Leslie West's is food, Jack Bruce's alcohol, and Corky Laing's sex - as pursued by various poltergeists representing each of the three. The album's front cover drawing shows the three band members, each pictured with their poltergeist alter-egos.\n\nAlthough not the hit that West, Bruce and Laing's debut album Why Dontcha was, Whatever Turns You On was a moderate success, reaching #87 on the Billboard U.S. album chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide one\n\n   1. &quot;Backfire&quot; (Bruce/Brown/West/Laing) - 2:57\n   2. &quot;Token&quot; - 5:18\n   3. &quot;Sifting Sand&quot; - 3:07\n   4. &quot;November Song&quot; - 5:55\n\nSide two\n\n   1. &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Machine&quot; - 3:53\n   2. &quot;Scotch Crotch&quot; (Bruce/Brown/West/Laing) - 3:17\n   3. &quot;Slow Blues&quot; - 5:08\n   4. &quot;Dirty Shoes&quot; - 2:23\n   5. &quot;Like a Plate&quot; - 3:07\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n    * Leslie West: guitar, vocals\n    * Jack Bruce: bass, vocals\n    * Corky Laing: drums, percussion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db7a81de7554f1fab573f971e3573a669cc924cb","amp;dn":"West%2C+Bruce+%26+Laing+-Whatever+Turns+You+On+%281973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db7a81de7554f1fab573f971e3573a669cc924cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,122,129,222,117,84,241,250,181,115,249,113,227,87,58,102,156,201,36,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
