That which is called 'Idols' on the title-page is simply the old truth that has been believed in hitherto. In plain English, The Twilight of the Idols means that the old truth is on its last legs.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nCertain it is that, for a rapid survey of the whole of Nietzsche's doctrine, no book, save perhaps the section entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOf Old and New TablesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in Thus Spake Zarathustra, could be of more real value than The Twilight of the Idols. Here Nietzsche is quite at his best. He is ripe for the marvellous feat of the transvaluation of all values. Nowhere is his language ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that marvellous weapon which in his hand became at once so supple and so murderous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more forcible and more condensed. Nowhere are his thoughts more profound. But all this does not by any means imply that this book is the easiest of Nietzsche's works. On the contrary, I very much fear that unless the reader is well prepared, not only in Nietzscheism, but also in the habit of grappling with uncommon and elusive problems, a good deal of the contents of this work will tend rather to confuse than to enlighten him in regard to what Nietzsche actually wishes to make clear in these pages.\n\n(Excerpt from A. Ludovici's Preface)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c9c67a61374612c310d634ba4019be369cbdf5","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Twilight+of+the+Idols++by+Friedrich+Nie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26c9c67a61374612c310d634ba4019be369cbdf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,201,198,122,97,55,70,18,195,16,214,52,186,64,25,190,54,156,189,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
