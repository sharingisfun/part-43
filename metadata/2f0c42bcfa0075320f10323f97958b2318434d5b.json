Based on the 1926 novel by Donn Byrne, the film stars Hobart Bosworth as Irish &quot;hanging judge&quot; James O'Brien. Even on his deathbed, O'Brien cannot stop meddling in the affairs of his daughter Connaught (June Collyer), insisting that the girl marry wealthy wastrel John Darcy (Earl Foxe). Alas, Connaught despises Darcy, preferring instead the poor-but-decent Donnaugh McDonnaugh (Larry Kent). Meanwhile, Irish expatriate Hogan (Victor McLaglen) returns to the Auld Sod to avenge his family's honor by killing the caddish Darcy. One of the highlights of Hangman's House is a steeplechase sequence, predating a similar sequence in Ford's The Quiet Man by 25 years. A young, unbilled John Wayne can clearly be spotted in this scene, enthusiastically urging on his favorite horse; reportedly, Wayne also appears as a condemned prisoner in a flashback sequence. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Hangman's House.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 898 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 10mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 770 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 10mn\n      Bit rate : 1 574 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 799 MiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 10mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 183 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 93.0 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 100 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 --abr 192\n      \nIMDB: tt0018972\n\nSilent movie with English intertitles; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0c42bcfa0075320f10323f97958b2318434d5b","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+Hangman%5C%27s+House+%5B1928%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0c42bcfa0075320f10323f97958b2318434d5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,12,66,188,250,0,117,50,15,16,50,63,151,149,139,35,24,67,77,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
