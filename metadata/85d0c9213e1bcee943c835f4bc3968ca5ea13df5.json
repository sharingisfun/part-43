It was directed by Roland Emmerich, who co-wrote the script with producer Dean Devlin.\n\nWhile promoting Stargate in Europe, Emmerich came up with the idea for the film when fielding a question about his own belief in the non-existence of alien life. He and Devlin decided to incorporate a large-scale attack when noticing that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Principal photography for the film began in July 1995 in New York City, and the film was officially completed on June 20, 1996.\n\nThe film was scheduled for release on July 3, 1996, but due to the high level of anticipation for the movie, many theaters began showing it on the evening of July 2, 1996, the same day the action in the film begins. The movie's combined domestic and international box office gross was $816,969,268, which at one point was the second-highest worldwide gross of all-time. It currently holds the 19th highest worldwide gross of a movie all-time, and was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and science fiction resurgences of the mid-to-late-1990s.\n\nEnjoy and seed please ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d0c9213e1bcee943c835f4bc3968ca5ea13df5","amp;dn":"Independence.Day%281996%29DvdRip.Xvid%29-BRIDOG-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d0c9213e1bcee943c835f4bc3968ca5ea13df5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,208,201,33,62,27,206,233,67,200,53,244,188,57,104,202,94,161,61,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
