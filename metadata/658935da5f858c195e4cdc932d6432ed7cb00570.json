This is followed by a typical flight in the cabin from Jo'burg to Frankfurt.\n\nThe next meeting place is Airbus' facility in Toulouse where our crew is about to take delivery of the last A340-600 for SAA. From the flight preparations we follow the pilots as we ferry the aircraft back to SAA's main base with a detour into British airspace.\n\nThis is my first time uploading so if I'm doing anything wrong stick a comment down there and let me know what it is!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658935da5f858c195e4cdc932d6432ed7cb00570","amp;dn":"JustPlanes+%28World+Air+Routes%29+South+African+A340-600","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658935da5f858c195e4cdc932d6432ed7cb00570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,137,53,218,95,133,140,25,94,76,220,147,45,100,50,237,124,176,5,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
