He went around saying &quot;kill, kill,\nkill&quot;, but his motivation was none other than that of jewish subversion and\ncausing racial strife.\n\nDavid Wolfgang Hawke started a fake Nazi group called Knights of Freedom,\nlater renamed American Nationalist Party, but it too fell flat on itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face when it\nwas found out that this character was really just a jew by the name\nof Andrew Britt Greenbaum.\n\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan originally gets it's name from the Greek word for circle, kyklos. It was basically the kyklos klan, or KKK, changed slightly to Ku Klux Klan.\nIf you take a look at wikipedia, it even admits this.  \n\nThose who know about the jew, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a well known fact\nthe reason they are called kikes, is because of the yiddish word for circle,\nwhich is kikel.\n\n\nwikipedia:\n\nThe word kike was born on Ellis Island when Jewish immigrants who\nwere there were also illiterate (or could not use Latin alphabet\nletters), when asked to sign the entry-forms with the customary 'X,'*\nrefused, because they associated an X with the cross of Christianity,\nand instead made a circle. The Yiddish word for 'circle' is kikel\n(pronounced KY-kul), and for 'little circle,' kikeleh (pronounced\nky-kul-uh). Before long the immigration inspectors were calling\nanyone who signed with an 'O' instead of an 'X' a kikel or kikeleh or\nkikee or, finally and succinctly, kike.\n\n\nI'm not saying the entire KKK is jewish, because it's not, but like all\ngroups that stir up racism and cause division, it certainly has it's share of\nthem. Both in leadership, members, and provocateurs, there are always plenty\nof jews afoot. It just so turns out that the KKK got it's name from the Greek\nword kyklos meaning circle, and jews got the name kike from the yiddish word\nkikel meaning circle as well.\n\nKnowing jews are always found on both sides of the racism equation (i.e. KKK,\nNazi Party, NAACP, ACLU, SPLC, ADL) it's at the very least quite intriguing\nthat these names have such similar origins. Another intriguing note is that\njews often attach great significance to names, and are known to alter them like\nthis to fit different purposes.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54696fee85c0dbc9c6a07f6caa49a5a48a74414b","amp;dn":"Jewish+involvement+in+the+Ku+Klux+Klan.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54696fee85c0dbc9c6a07f6caa49a5a48a74414b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,105,111,238,133,192,219,201,198,160,127,108,170,73,165,164,138,116,65,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
