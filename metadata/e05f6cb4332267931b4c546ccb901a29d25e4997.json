It was pretty good, but had a few issues.\n\nVideo has a slight rolling flicker to it &amp; too much contrast and brightness, so removed a lot of both.\n\nAlso, we made our own subtitle SRT to Hardcode English subs for the non-English parts only. Might have missed a spot or 2, but definitely got most of them.\n\nWe used our OWN LiNE, manually removing each crackle, and then ran through an EQ to bring out a little more bass.\n\nAnything worth doing is worth doing right, well we believe that at least. Those that know we have raw audio should know to wait for us by now. ;)\n\nExtra: We've included the Iron.Man.2.2010.CAM.END-CREDITS.READNFO.XviD-SPOOKY release in this, for anybody curious about the credit scene.
