Her over the top rendition of pianist Jack Dieval's &quot;The Way of Love&quot; keeps the gender intact, as did Kathy Kirby and Cher on their respective hit versions, of a woman singing a song of heartbreak to another woman, only Bassey puts her trademark style on it bringing it into another realm.  Chris White includes two lengthy pages of liner notes in the informative eight-page booklet which includes four lovely photos of the queen diva.  Perry Como's hit version of the title track, &quot;And I Love You So,&quot; a composition from the pen of Don McLean, might've kept this album from getting more exposure, but it is essential Shirley Bassey which her fan base is well aware of.  She makes &quot;Bless the Beasts and the Children&quot; exotic while the Tom Evans and Pete Ham timeless classic, &quot;Without You,&quot; gets a sort of Eartha Kitt as &quot;Catwoman&quot; reading, Bassey borrowing a bit but never copying.  Johnny Harris forgoes the neo-Phil Spector production of Harry Nilsson's hit version to arrange, produce and conduct a special blend to fit Bassey's vocal stylings.  The two Noel Rogers produced outtakes from the album sessions.  Like many of the artist's releases, this is a real treasure and a true work of art.  ~ Joe Viglione, AMG\n\nPersonnel: \nShirley Bassey (Vocals)\nJohnny Harris (Arranged and Conducted)\n\nShirley Bassey - And I Love You So Tracks:\n01  Someday (John Bettis/Richard Carpenter) 4:58\n02  Bless the Beasts and the Children (Perry Botkin, Jr. /Barry de Vorzon) 3:08 \n03  Jezahel (Ivano Fossanti/Oscar Prudente) 2:50 \n04  And I Love You So (Don McLean) 4:31 \n05  The Way of Love (Jack Dieval/Al Stillman) 2:38 \n06  The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face (Ewan MacColl) 4:48 \n07  Day by Day (Stephen Schwartz/John Michael Tebelack) 2:47 \n08  Without You (Tom Evans/Pete Ham) 3:34 \n09  Ballad of the Sad Young Men (Fran Landesman/Thomas Wolf) 5:29\n10  I Don't Know How to Love Him (Andrew Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice) 4:22 \n11  I'd Do It All Again (Richard Ahlert/Leon Carr) 3:34 \n12  If We Only Have Love (Eric Blau/Jacques Brel/Mort Shuman) 3:53 \nBonus tracks:\n13  If I Should Love Again (Guistina/Norman Newell) 2:47 \n14  Let Me Be the One (Roger Nichols/Paul Williams) 2:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b75a90aff21ee1dc1caed2a7724140c3dfc637","amp;dn":"Shirley+Bassey+-+And+I+Love+You+So+%281972%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b75a90aff21ee1dc1caed2a7724140c3dfc637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,183,90,144,175,242,30,225,220,28,174,210,167,114,65,64,195,223,198,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
