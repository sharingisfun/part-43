It will also make its own save.\n\nI'm not sure if this is the complete discography of Nightwish, but its damn close. When I prepped the original ISO, I ended up with 2 extra places for songs, so I stuffed some Paramore in there to keep in with the chick rock theme.\n\nPLEASE MAKE NOTE- I take no credit whatsoever for putting this collection together or arranging the note charts. The lovely people at the FoF forums did all the heavy lifting. All I did was put their work into a Wii game. The original thread can be found here &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=41170&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=41170&lt;/a&gt;\n\nwith links to videos of most of these songs.\n\nAlso, there are a few other things done like all songs (besides bonus) are available right away. The cheat codes have been simplified, so just go to the cheat screen and start mashing buttons and you'll unlock crap. Maybe I made the store free. I don't recall.\n\nA couple things I missed, there still is the original music (paint it black and what-not) for the menus. The album art and details in the song store are not changed from the original.\n\nthanks to the FoF forum and teamGhost for making this possible.\n\nSETLIST:\n-\nNightwish - Elvenpath (1997)\nNightwish - Beauty And The Beast (1997)\nNightwish - The Carpenter (1997)\nNightwish - Astral Romance (1997)\nNightwish - Angels Fall First (1997)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - Tutankhamen (1997)\nNightwish - Nymphomaniac Fantasia (1997)\nNightwish - Know Why The Nightingale Sings (1997)\nNightwish - Lappi(Lapland) (1997)\nNightwish - Stargazers (1998)\nNightwish - Gethsemane (1998)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - Devil And The Deep Dark Ocean (1998)\nNightwish - Sacrament Of Wilderness (1998)\nNightwish - Passion And The Opera (1998)\nNightwish - Swanheart (1998)\nNightwish - Moondance (1998)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - The Riddler (1998)\nNightwish - The Pharaoh Sails To Orion (1998)\nNightwish - Walking In The Air (1998)\nNightwish - Nightquest (1998)\nNightwish - She Is My Sin (2000)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - The Kinslayer (2000)\nNightwish - Come Cover Me (2000)\nNightwish - Wanderlust (2000)\nNightwish - Two For Tragedy (2000)\nNightwish - Wishmaster (2000)\nNightwish - Bare Grace Misery (2000)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - Crownless (2000)\nNightwish - Deep Silent Complete (2000)\nNightwish - Dead Boy's Poem (2000)\nNightwish - Fantasmic (2000)\nNightwish - Bless the Child (2002)\n\n\n-\nNightwish - End of All Hope (2002)\nNightwish - Dead to the World (2002)\nNightwish - Ever Dream (2002)\nNightwish - Slaying the Dreamer (2002)\nNightwish - Forever Yours (2002)\n\n\n\nNightwish - Ocean Soul (2002)\nNightwish - Feel for You (2002)\nNightwish - Phantom of the Opera (2002)\nNightwish - Beauty of the Beast (2002)\nNightwish - Dark Chest Of Wonders (2004)\n\nBonus songs\n-----------\nNightwish - Wish I Had An Angel (2004)\nNightwish - Nemo (2004)\nNightwish - Planet Hell (2004)\nNightwish - Creek Mary's Blood (2004)\nNightwish - The Siren (2004)\nNightwish - Dead Gardens (2004)\nNightwish - Romanticide (2004)\nNightwish - Ghost Love Score (2004)\nNightwish - Higher Than Hope (2004)\nNightwish - White Night Fantasy (2004)\nNightwish - Live To Tell The Tale (2004)\nNightwish - The Poet And The Pendulum (2007)\nNightwish - Bye Bye Beautifull (2007)\nNightwish - Amaranth (2007)\nNightwish - Cadence Of Her Last Breath (2007)\nNightwish - Master Passion Greed (2007)\nNightwish - Eva (2007)\nNightwish - Sahara (2007)\nNightwish - Whoever Brings The Night (2007)\nNightwish - For The Heart I Once Had (2007)\nNightwish - The Islander (2007)\nNightwish - Last Of The Wilds (2007)\nNightwish - 7 Days To The Wolves (2007)\nNightwish - Meadows Of Heaven (2007)\nNightwish - The Escapist (2008)\n\nNon career songs\n----------------\nNightwish - High Hopes (2006)\nNightwish - Over The Hills And Far Away (2001)\nNightwish - Lagoon (2002)\nNightwish - Where Were You Last Night (2004)\nParamore - Decoy (2006)\nParamore - Emergency (Crab Mix) (2006)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd don't let the seeder/leacher count fool you.
