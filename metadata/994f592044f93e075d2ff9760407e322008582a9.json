All from the very beginning of the game at the first save point. I just thought that you guys might like it and if you play FF7 and want to use my game data all you have to do to load it is open up ePSXe go to Config then Memory Cards select whichever one you want (I used slot 1) then when it prompts you choose the Memcard folder and choose &quot;Final Fantasy VII a.gme&quot; then ok. When you load up your game select memory card slot 1 and there you go.\n\nUnzip it and mount it to your ps emulator.\n\nSeed, comment and most of all... Enjoy!\n\nAlso if you have any questions feel free to email me or ask in a comment.\n\nExaltedOne","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994f592044f93e075d2ff9760407e322008582a9","amp;dn":"ePSXe+v1.6.3+Fulling+working+with+Bios+and+Plugins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994f592044f93e075d2ff9760407e322008582a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,79,89,32,68,249,62,7,93,47,249,118,4,7,227,34,0,133,130,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
