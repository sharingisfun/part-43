Sex Mob rip through the Barry songbook, infusing each piece with a sexy, almost trashy vibe that was always subdued in the Bond films.

As sexy as anything Bond should be, and more fun than you thought jazz could be.\n\nTracks:\nDr. Yes\nTeasing the Korean\nThis Never Happened to the Other Feller\n007\nBattle at Piz Gloria\nYou Only Live Twice\nBond With Bongos\nOddjob's Pressing Engagement\nBond Back in Action Again\nOver and Out\nDawn Raid on Fort Knox\nNobody Does It Better\nDr. Yes (Reprise)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4e0e35f1eb46097e24e1d6a33b3b72c2c26d703","amp;dn":"Sex+Mob+-+Sex+Mob+Does+Bond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4e0e35f1eb46097e24e1d6a33b3b72c2c26d703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,224,227,95,30,180,96,151,226,78,29,106,51,179,183,44,44,38,215,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
