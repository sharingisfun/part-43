It is much longer than any of the former projects, containing more songs and filling the maximum time possible on a CD (74 minutes). &quot;I figured our fans have waited for 3 years since Valley of Decision and they deserve an earful,&quot; says Mark Mohr, the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s founder, lead singer, primary songwriter, and producer/engineer. It is also the most authentic reggae music Christafari has ever recorded. With &quot;The Soul Fire Crew,&quot; (ChristafariÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s backing band) behind it, WordSound&amp;Power is more true to the roots. \n\nThe album is also more versatile than any of the past efforts. Listeners will hear more of ChristafariÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature Ragamuffin chatting, greater use of percussion, two acoustic guitar songs, broader lyrical subjects, special guest appearances by three remarkable lead vocalists (Ace Winn, Bernard Schroeter, and Geneman), incredible harmonies, and even a slight rock influence (including talk box guitar) on a couple tracks. The diversity and delivery of the performers on WordSound&amp;Power take this recording to places Christafari has never been before. \n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8eb1e5a57dd1af1830d0aeabc0ced671f542da","amp;dn":"Christafari+-+1999+-+Word+Sound+And+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8eb1e5a57dd1af1830d0aeabc0ced671f542da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,142,177,229,165,125,209,175,24,48,208,174,171,192,206,214,113,245,66,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
