Although he had performed in this style prior to 1936, Big Bill Broonzy was in fact one of the pioneers of the Chicago band style, making a slew of electric horn driven hit records for a number of labels. After 1951, Broonzy inexplicably returned to his folk-blues roots, recording with Pete Seeger, Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, and Leadbelly. An accomplished acoustic performer: it is for this period that he is best remembered in Europe. During the later 1960s blues boom, he was seen as somewhat academic and fuddy-duddy, and not as much cited or covered as say, Muddy Waters or Robert Johnson. An exception was his classic and chilling 'Keys To The Highway' recorded by Derek And The Dominoes on their classic &quot;Layla&quot; album. Here we have 27 of his amazing and seldom-heard rockin' Chicago sides.\n\nTracklist:\n1. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve Mistreatin Me [2:54] \n2. (I'm A) Wonderin' Man [3:05]\n3.
