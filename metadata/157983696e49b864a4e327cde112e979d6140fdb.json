All six issues, the last three were released under the name &quot;Universal War One: Revelations&quot; in the US, but it's really part of the same story.\n\n\nUW1 is one of the best sci-fi thriller ever written, the balance between real science and technobabble is good and all the characters are fleshed out and believable (mostly). The art is amazing, especially the exterior space shots.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157983696e49b864a4e327cde112e979d6140fdb","amp;dn":"Universal+War+One+%28All+6+issues%29+%28Soleil%2FMarvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157983696e49b864a4e327cde112e979d6140fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,121,131,105,110,73,184,100,164,227,39,205,225,18,233,121,214,20,15,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
