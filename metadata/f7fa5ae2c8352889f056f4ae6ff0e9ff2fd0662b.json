Their instruments ring together collectively, so close and yet so far apart in tessitura, sound, matter, playing technique, history and imagination. Over long hours of improvisation the two musicians would exchange their wisdom, progressively laying down the bases for a mutant universe of sound whose process was totally organic and laid on the foundations of Mandinka music, yet which made a radical break with all the clichÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“s of the music called fusion or world . Accompanying them on this recording are bassist Ira Coleman and drummer Laurent Robin, and Malian singer Mamani Keita on the magnificent title Touma . With this album, their first, Kouyate &amp; Neerman unveil new territory that is both authentic and innovative, a work of poetic power that is absolutely stunning.\n-- amazon.com\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nPersonnel -\nLansine Kouyate - balafon\nDavid Neerman - electric &amp; acoustic vibes\nIra Coleman - bass\nLaurent Robin - drums\n\nGuests :\nMamani Keita - lead vocals on &quot;Touma&quot;\nMoriba Koita - n'goni on &quot;Touma&quot;\nCheick Tidiane Seck - odunumba on &quot;Sara&quot;\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTrack List\n01 - Here\n02 - Djanfa Magni\n03 - Niokome\n04 - Boroba\n05 - Tiziri\n06 - Bamanan Don\n07 - Le Destin Ii\n08 - Touma\n09 - Momo\n10 - Kangadub\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7fa5ae2c8352889f056f4ae6ff0e9ff2fd0662b","amp;dn":"Kouyate+%26+Neerman+-+Kangaba+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7fa5ae2c8352889f056f4ae6ff0e9ff2fd0662b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,250,90,226,200,53,40,137,240,86,244,174,111,240,233,255,47,208,102,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
