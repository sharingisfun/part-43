Retired, that is, until producer Joe Henry met him in 2008 and dogged him until he graciously caved in. He coaxed Allison into his basement studio and cut the seven originals and five covers that became The Way of the World with a host of players from his own stable in five days. \n\nAt 82, Allison is as smart, cagey, and inventive as ever. All but one of these cuts feature his weathered but still wiry dry baritone voice that exudes a trademark jazz singer cum beat poetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s phrasing. For anyone whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seen him in the last decade -- or heard his jaw-dropping Live in London recordings -- his keyboard skills are sharp as an Argentine stiletto: give a listen to the lone instrumental, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrush.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Allison's elastic harmonic sense is as beautifully unruly as Monk's, yet his improvisational ideas are carried by a nimble-fingered force worthy of Bud Powell. \n\nThe opener, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Brain,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a smoking rewrite of Willie Dixon's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy Babe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Allison reflects on the ever-changing intellectual capabilities of his gray matter while punching up the piano's middle register. The blues have been at the heart of AllisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s piano attack (Back Country Suite, 1957), though heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always wedded them to swing, rag, and bop. \n\nHenry underscores that with subtle touches: the strummed Gypsy swing mandola on the ironic betrayal anthem ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Know You DidnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mean ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that engages with a knotty bluesed-out piano break and a warm tenor solo -- ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Ben Webster -- and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverybody Thinks YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re an Angel,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a waltz with a Weissenborn guitar, follow a similar principle to delightfully different ends. \n\nOn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œModest ProposalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Allison humorously asserts the compassionate idea that perhaps God is so weary he deserves a vacation. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a strutting piano-and-vocal number, where Allison's saloon-singer irony might scandalize a preacher but makes the congregation laugh. \n\nThe elegant parlor ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOnce in a WhileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the shuffling, not brokenhearted blues of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m AlrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ also stand out. The latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s addition of electric guitar, mandola, and saxophone might seem like frills for an Allison session, but sound perfectly balanced and natural. \n\nOn the final track, Buddy Johnson's WWII-era pop tune ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis New Situation,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Allison duets with daughter Amy; the two swing beautifully together. The Way of the World is not a comeback album; Henry had a nagging suspicion that Allison might have something new to say and Allison obliged. In the process they created a gem of an album that proves the pianist and songwriter still has many tricks up his elegantly tailored, eternally hip sleeve. \n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n\n1.
