Co-produced by The Neptunes and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, it was released as the fifth UK single on July 30, 2007. It was primarily produced for R&amp;B singer Amerie and her 3rd studio album Because I Love It, but was rejected on grounds of project funding and forwarded to label mate Beyonce. The song received positive responses from critics.\n\nThe single performed moderately on charts. &quot;Green Light&quot; peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 46 in Ireland. The Freemasons remix of the track peaked at number 18 on the Dutch Top 40 chart. Its accompanying music video is inspired by Robert Palmer's 1985 music video &quot;Addicted to Love&quot;. BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© considered the video, which is her second to feature her all-female tour band Suga Mama, her toughest shoot.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Green Light&quot; was directed by Melina and co-directed by BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. Filmed in early 2007, it was one of the videos shot in two weeks for the B'Day Anthology Video Album (2007) and was one out of eight previously unseen clips. &quot;Green Light&quot; was the third video shot during the sessions. A one-minute music video for &quot;Kitty Kat&quot; serves as the introduction for the video.\n\nThe clip was inspired mainly by Robert Palmer's 1985 music video &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; with its &quot;stone-faced models pretending to play guitars&quot;. &quot;Green Light&quot; was considered by BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© as a modern version of the video because they used the instruments as props, where she pretended as a rock star. She revealed that the scenes reminded her of Vanity 6.\n\nBeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© considered &quot;Green Light&quot; the &quot;toughest video&quot; to shoot. Besides from dressing in latex rubber clothing, she and her back-up dancers had to wear ballet-pointe heels. The shoes blistered her feet and gave muscle spasms due to the 18-hour session. BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© invited her all-female tour band, Suga Mama, to make their second appearance in a video after their debut performance on the 2006 music video of &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;. The video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on March 28, 2007.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60bd9e4bf24d414794d4d27d615fa82f588a6ef1","amp;dn":"Beyonce+-+Green+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60bd9e4bf24d414794d4d27d615fa82f588a6ef1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,189,158,75,242,77,65,71,148,212,210,125,97,95,168,47,88,138,110,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
