Raymond is desperate to protect the Kent\n      farm he has spent a lifetime building up and wants to leave it\n      all to his sons, who work there, and leave out his daughter, who\n      doesn't. But wife Jane isn't convinced this is fair. Meanwhile\n      devout Muslims Khalid and Sara have raised their two daughters\n      to be equal to their son, but the Koran states that boys should\n      be left twice as much as their sisters. Khalid and Sara face a\n      dilemma over making a will that is fair to their kids in\n      contemporary Britain, while remaining true to their faith. Sir\n      Gerry is assisted by top lawyer, Sue Medder, who sets out the\n      legal options in each case, and writes the final wills. Sir\n      Gerry gets all the family involved in the debate, because\n      keeping problems secret is no way to solve them. Deciding who\n      gets what in a will can be one of the toughest choices anyone\n      can have to make. But making no decisions at all and dying\n      without a will, can cause rifts that tear families apart.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
