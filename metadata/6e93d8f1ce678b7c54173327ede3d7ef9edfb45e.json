Confession (translates as sense of duty, and might vaguely refer to St. Augustine's Confessions but with a Russian soul) is a soul-searching epic film on tedium and the human spirit. It covers the mundane life on a Russian battleship while the ship sails the icy waters of the Barents Sea and the ship's unnamed fictionalized Commander (Serguei Bakai), while standing on the bridge in the often foggy weather, discusses marine life, the thoughtful writings in his diary, his love for Chekhov and the duty of the men to serve their country while offering his fruitful meditation on despair and how the loneliness of life at sea affects him and his conscripted crew.\n\nIf you're not bored to death or put off by its bleakness, this unique film has the ability to capture on film the Russian sense of fatalism that its great writers (with Chekhov, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky depicted as the very pillars of Russian civilization) have captured throughout history in their literature (something only a handful of great films were able to do). It very likely will make the casual filmgoer seasick. But for the more hearty adventurers, those looking for something intelligently different from a film, this well-crafted numbing lyrical work on stasis, isolation and depression should be looked upon as a rare opportunity to see the film of a great artist, the replacement of the late Andrei Tarkovsky as Russia's greatest filmmaker, operate uncensored and in full control of the medium. The b/w pic succeeds despite the lack of plot, action sequences, formidable characters and structure, which should blow away those sticklers believing film must be just narrative.\n\nEpisode 1\nGeneral           : Povinnost 1.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 2 239 Kbps\nLength            : 670 MiB for 41mn 50s 8ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 035 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 320 (1.950) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEpisode 2\nGeneral           : Povinnost 2.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 2 150 Kbps\nLength            : 691 MiB for 44mn 57s 61ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 946 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 320 (1.950) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEpisode 3\nGeneral           : Povinnost 3.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 2 291 Kbps\nLength            : 666 MiB for 40mn 39s 170ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 087 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 320 (1.950) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEpisode 4\nGeneral           : Povinnost 4.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 2 265 Kbps\nLength            : 628 MiB for 38mn 46s 558ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 061 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 320 (1.950) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEpisode 5\nGeneral           : Povinnost 5.avi\nFormat            : AVI at 2 206 Kbps\nLength            : 673 MiB for 42mn 40s 24ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 2 002 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 320 (1.950) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435983/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435983/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian audio; French, English, German, Spanish and Italian subpack\n\nAleksandr Sokurov - Povinnost [Confession] (1998)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e93d8f1ce678b7c54173327ede3d7ef9edfb45e","amp;dn":"Aleksandr+Sokurov+-+Povinnost+%5BConfession%5D+%281998%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e93d8f1ce678b7c54173327ede3d7ef9edfb45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,147,216,241,206,103,139,124,84,23,51,39,237,227,215,239,158,223,180,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
