The show was created by Tom Kapinos. The protagonist, Hank Moody (David Duchovny), is a troubled novelist whose move to California, coupled with his writer's block, complicates his relationships with his long time girlfriend Karen (Natascha McElhone) and daughter Becca (Madeleine Martin).\n\n\nOverview:\n\nHank Moody may be a talented author, despite his gift of the gab, especially for live seducing, his private life is a mess. Repeated attempts to have a stable relationship with Karen, also for the sake of their daughter Becca, fail because of their extreme libertarian infidelity. Hank's sexual appetite also infects talent agent Charlie Runkle, who indulges in all kinds of naughtiness too. More 'victims of hormones' contribute to the lustily lust-loaded plot.\n\nnfo:\n\nRELEASE NAME .....: Californication - Season 01 to 04 - HDTV\nFORMAT ...........: AVI-MPEG-4/XviD\nFORMAT VERSiON ...: Version 1\nFORMAT PROFiLE ...: Advanced Simple@L5/Layer 3\nBiT RATE MODE ....: Variable\nOVERALL BiT RATE .: Video- 1080Kbps/Audio-128\nGENRE ............: Comedy | Crime | Drama\nWRiTiNG LiBRARY ..: XviD 1.2.1/LAME3.98.2\nTOTAL DURATiON ...: \nTOTAL FiLE SiZE ..: 10.9 GB\n\nEpisodes\n\n\nSeason 1: \n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 01: Pilot\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 13 August 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 33:01\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 02: Hell-A Woman\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 20 August 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:37\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 03: The Whore of Babylon\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27 August 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:07\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 04: Fear and Loathing at the Fundraiser\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3 September 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:40\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 05: LOL\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 10 September 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 26:33\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 06: Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 17 September 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:37\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 07: Girls, Interrupted\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 24 September 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 26:46\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 08: California Son\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 1 October 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:37\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 09: Filthy Lucre\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 8 October 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:40\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 10: The Devil's Threesome\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 15 October 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:57\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 11: Turn the Page\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 22 October 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:58\n__________________________________________\nSeason 1, Episode 12: The Last Waltz\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 29 October 2007\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:32\n__________________________________________\n\n\n\nSeason 2: \n__________________________________________\nSeason 2, Episode 1: Slip of the Tongue\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 28 September 2008\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 27:36\n__________________________________________\nSeason 2, Episode 2: The Great Ashby\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 5 October 2008\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 28:10\n__________________________________________\nSeason 2, Episode 3: No Way to Treat a Lady\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 12 October 2008\nRuntime (minutes)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 28:19\n__________________________________________\nSeason 2, Episode 4: The Raw &amp;
