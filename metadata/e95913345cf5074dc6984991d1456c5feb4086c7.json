A couple won't terminate a pregnancy when it's discovered that their baby has a malformed brain, so Aaron and Gina come up with a plan to do an experimental fetal operation. Miller gives permission to proceed, in part because he also owns a cable TV network, and plans to televise the procedure. But the parents aren't so sure, and then they accidentally observe Shutt and Simon in an embarrassing situation. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e95913345cf5074dc6984991d1456c5feb4086c7","amp;dn":"Chicago+Hope+S06E19+-+Miller+Time.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e95913345cf5074dc6984991d1456c5feb4086c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,89,19,52,92,245,7,77,198,152,73,145,209,69,108,95,235,64,134,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
