As an independent artist, Stroup has had her latest songs placed on major network TV stations from ABCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Private Practice, Brothers &amp; Sisters, Castle, the CWÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s One Tree Hill, MTV's World of Jenks and most recently 'Backed into the Corner' was featured on the season premier of Grey's Anatomy.

Further, he has a desire to use her music to inspire others to positive action as she partners with Mocha Club and a non profit geared towards college student mobilization dedicated to bringing hope in Africa through education, clean water projects, food distribution.\n\nQUOTES:::\n&quot;Amy Stroup has what is a rarity among most people doing music but common for all great artists that make a real impact - unique artistry  that is immediately identifiable. That special something that cuts through the noise. I've been a fan since the first song.&quot; \n- Nathan Chapman- Grammy Award Winning Producer Taylor Swift\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music is interesting, lyrically compelling, and musically fresh. Plus she is an incredible singer and performer.  Her view of the world as a songwriter is unique and optimistic, vulnerable and strong. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \n- Jody Williams- BMI NASHVILLE\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmy is one of the most talented independent singer/songwriters working in Nashville today.  She stunned me performing live on our Nashville Sunday Night broadcast and as I investigated her recordings, I found gems like &quot;Hold On To Hope Love,&quot; &quot;I Fell For You&quot; and &quot;I'm In,&quot; which should all be hits.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/03/amy-stroup/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/03/amy-stroup/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f1ce8e1b05fc59ea3d4109d38e2dc998fddbe8","amp;dn":"Aroup...The+Other+Side+of+Love%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f1ce8e1b05fc59ea3d4109d38e2dc998fddbe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,241,206,142,27,5,252,89,234,61,65,9,211,142,45,201,152,253,219,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
