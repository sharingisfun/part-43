Because the invading Spanish suppressed nearly all knowledge of how the script worked, unlocking its meaning posed one of archaeology's fiercest challenges, until now.\n\nFor the first time, NOVA presents the epic inside story of how the decoding was done, told by the experts at the center of one of archaeology's greatest detective stories. Cracking the Maya Code highlights the ingenious breakthroughs that opened the door to deciphering the elaborate and exotic script and finally cracked the code, unleashing a flood of dramatic new insights about the ancient civilization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected &amp; Written by: David Lebrun\n-----------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nTitle: Cracking The Maya Code\nYear:  2008\nFile Size: 465 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:56:34\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 496x368\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1151 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 4/3\nFPS:  29.970029\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels: 2\nSubtitles: (N/A)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1218431/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1218431/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n****  RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc40cffe787ad43abf1ac7f74e85b5fbec156cc","amp;dn":"Cracking+The+Maya+Code-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc40cffe787ad43abf1ac7f74e85b5fbec156cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,196,12,255,231,135,173,67,171,241,172,127,116,232,91,95,190,193,86,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
