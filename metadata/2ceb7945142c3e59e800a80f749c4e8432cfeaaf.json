Establish your reputation with a cutting-edge but memorable dance track (&quot;Toca's Miracle&quot;), and then guaranteeing future chart success by recruiting female session singers to perform catchy Euro-pop compositions (&quot;Everytime You Need Me&quot;). This method may not guarantee longevity, or demonstrate avant-garde creativity but it certainly generates the cash. Drawing on the pop-pulling power of session artistes Damae, Coco, Maria Rubia, Eva Martinez the album contains plenty &quot;Everytime You Need Me&quot; type songs. &quot;Reach Out&quot; and &quot;Magic&quot; are healthy top 10 league singles which are pleasantly catchy, and are guaranteed club floor fillers from Inverness to Ibiza. &quot;You Are Alive&quot; and &quot;Move On&quot; provide a surprise, darker edge to the album, mixing early-eighties electro-pop similar in the style of Visage with more contemporary trance sounds. Sophisticated Euro-pop at its best.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Toca's Miracle\n[02] Everytime You Need Me\n[03] Reach Out\n[04] You Are Alive\n[05] Move On\n[06] Do You Really Want To Feel It\n[07] Magic\n[08] Everybody Knows\n[09] Take My Hand\n[10] Outlast\n[11] Toca Me\n\n\nMusic Videos\n\n[01] Toca's Miracle [40mb]\n[02] Everytime You Need Me [40mb]\n[03] Toca Me [37mb]\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:50m:53s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 242mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- Quicktime\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Electronica Dance\n\nOriginally Released\t- 15 January 2001\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Orbit Records Gmbh EMI Records\n\n\n=====================================================\n\nYou Are Alive [CDS] - Fragma [2001]\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] You Are Alive [Radio Edit]\n[02] You Are Alive [Extended Version]\n[03] Toca Megamix\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] You Are Alive \t[Quicktime]\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time\t- 00h:17m:45s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 93.5 mb (Including Mp3s, Music Video, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320 khps\n\nMusic File Type    \t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Electronica Dance\n\nOriginally Release \t- 08 October 2001\n\n=====================================================\n\nToca's Miracle [CDS] - Fragma [2000]\n\t\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Toca's Miracle [Radio Edit]\n[02] Toca's Miracle (Club Mix)\n[03] Everybody Knows\n \n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:15m:56s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 37.9mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\t\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Electronic Dance\n\nOriginally Released\t- 20 June 2000\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Posivtiva Orbit Records Gmbh EMI Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Fragma \n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/fragma \n\t\t \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ceb7945142c3e59e800a80f749c4e8432cfeaaf","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Toca+-+Fragma+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ceb7945142c3e59e800a80f749c4e8432cfeaaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,235,121,69,20,44,62,89,232,0,168,15,116,156,78,132,50,207,234,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
