Here two men are destined for an explosive collision: \nJohn Sutter, Wall Street lawyer, holding fast to a fading aristocratic legacy; and Frank Bellarosa, the Mafia don who seizes his piece of the staid and unprepared Gold Coast like a latter-day barbarian chief and draws Sutter and his regally beautiful wife, Susan, into his violent world. Told from Sutter's sardonic-and often hilarious-point of view, and laced with sexual passion and suspense, &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; is Nelson DeMille's acclaimed story of friendship and seduction, love and betrayal.\n\nNELSON DeMILLE is the author of fourteen acclaimed novels. including the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers &quot;Night Fall&quot;, &quot;Plum Island&quot;, &quot;Wild Fire&quot;, &quot;The Lion's Game&quot;, &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; and &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;.\n\nCHRISTIAN RUMMEL has recorded many audio books in a variety of genres. He has most recently worked with NYC companies Theatre For a New Audience and Clubbed Thumb. Christian has also appeared in several episodes of Law &amp; Order. He resides in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nApproximately 21 hours from 18 CDs at 128 kbps in MP3 format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8624d4db78b485c8a5a4af1a11067d04f40796","amp;dn":"Nelson+DeMille+-+The+Gold+Coast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb8624d4db78b485c8a5a4af1a11067d04f40796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,134,36,212,219,120,180,133,200,165,164,175,26,17,6,125,4,244,7,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
