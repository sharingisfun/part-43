Next, you take this newly-produced Arcane Ace, and easily split it into two Arcane aces.The third Arcane ace materializes right out of thin air, at your fingertips.\n\nFor the climax, with the cards held motionless, the fourth and final Arcane ace visually appears between the others.\n\nIn the end, four Arcane aces sit fanned at your fingertips. Thunderbird uses no gimmicks or trickery; just well-composed sleight of hand.\n\n\n\nmore info @\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ellusionist.com/thunderbird-arcane-lee-asher.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ellusionist.com/thunderbird-arcane-lee-asher.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0392d80761b8f2ba13d98907bd402372f18895a5","amp;dn":"thunderbird+arcane+edition.PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0392d80761b8f2ba13d98907bd402372f18895a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,146,216,7,97,184,242,186,19,217,137,7,189,64,35,114,241,136,149,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
