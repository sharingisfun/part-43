But this is not a warmed-up dish, nor simply a retro album, it's clearly a contemporary production, both in terms of instrumentation and singing styles, and a highly professional one at that. Songs with unusual progressions, harmony vocals, acoustic guitars, phased Fender-Rhodes e-piano, everything simmering at medium speed and volume. Though the power of invention lets up a bit here and there (tracks 6-8), the album walks the line between Pop and Soul with aplomb, and while the songs for the next release could be a bit more varied and perhaps even more daring, the basic formula is fine with me. A most welcome release.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/31/the-beauty-room/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/31/the-beauty-room/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24c14a23f2ad9bb79d7ad1bbea33439d3904cec","amp;dn":"The+Beauty+Room...The+Beauty+Room%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24c14a23f2ad9bb79d7ad1bbea33439d3904cec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,76,20,162,63,42,217,187,121,215,173,27,190,163,52,57,211,144,76,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
