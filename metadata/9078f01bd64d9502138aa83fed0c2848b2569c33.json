It is his second-biggest hit in the United States, reaching #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song was certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\n\nThe singer complains about the advice of friends, who seem to have made it &quot;their appointed duty&quot; to talk the singer out of a romantic relationship that they see as one-sided, and where the singer is &quot;used&quot;. But the singer has no doubt in wanting things to continue as they are, and implies that it is pleasurable enough to be &quot;used&quot; in that fashion that being &quot;used up&quot; completely would be welcome.\n\nThe singer goes on to describe telling a relative who urges resistance to being &quot;walked on&quot;, that envy for the singer's circumstances would follow from really comprehending them.\n\nThe singer admits that some of the lover's behavior is abusive -- for example, snubs when those of higher status, whom the lover apparently seeks to curry favor with, are present -- but &quot;when you love me&quot;, the singer &quot;can't get enough&quot;.\n\nFinally, as the song fades out, the singer admits to being used, but says that &quot;it aint too bad the way you're using me, 'cause I sure am using you to do the things you do.&quot;\n\n\nTime 4.47\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1024","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9078f01bd64d9502138aa83fed0c2848b2569c33","amp;dn":"Bill+Withers+-+Use+Me+%5B1972%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9078f01bd64d9502138aa83fed0c2848b2569c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,120,240,27,214,77,149,2,19,138,168,63,237,12,40,72,178,86,156,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
