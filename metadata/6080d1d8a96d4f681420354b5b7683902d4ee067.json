Where to begin ....alot of work and time went into this so thanks for all sources and to users who helped.\n\nRight first off our video source had some movement so we cut it up and rotated the videos and resized all to match up ...also there was two parts missing one when the camera got hidden and missed 1min of footage and the other was the after end credits. For these two parts we've used the video out of our first TS and also used spookys end credits video and audio...both needed work to match the main video eg resizing,framerates and what not.\n\nOnce we got all the video we had to added spookys cam audio to the end of our audio to make a complete audio file and then it was a case of syncing which was a bitch!!!....mainly due to different sources and video being cut, but we've got there in the end.\n\nNow a few things firstly yes the subtitles are all in english inc speaking parts and locations.\nSecondly due to the movement there is a few parts when the camera movement from left to right and vice versa.....we've done alot of work and made right of most be there is parts were you'll get a black border down the right hand side.\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6080d1d8a96d4f681420354b5b7683902d4ee067","amp;dn":"Iron+Man+2+TS+READNFO+V2+XViD+-+IMAGiNE%28ENG+SUBS+%2B+END+CREDITS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6080d1d8a96d4f681420354b5b7683902d4ee067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,128,209,216,169,109,79,104,20,32,53,75,91,118,131,144,45,78,224,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
