The Boss (May 1979) was a gold-selling album, followed by the platinum-selling Diana (May 1980), which featured the number one single &quot;Upside Down&quot; and the Top Ten hit &quot;I'm Coming Out.&quot;\n\nWikipedia bio:\n\n&quot;The Boss is a 1979 album released by Diana Ross on the Motown label. This album was written and produced by longtime Ross collaborators Nickolas Ashford &amp; Valerie Simpson and marked her return to Top 40 radio based on the strength of the title track, which peaked #19 on the pop singles chart, and #12 on the US R&amp;B Chart. The following singles &quot;No One Gets the Prize&quot; and &quot;It's My House&quot; became club and R&amp;B hits respectively. The album was subsequently certified gold by the RIAA and ultimately sold about 850,000 copies. The album was remastered and released on CD in 2001 with 12&quot; versions of &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;It's My House&quot; as extra tracks.&quot;\n\nAmazon.com bio:\n\n&quot;While hardly as superfine a Ross vehicle as the Chic-produced Diana of a year later, 1979's The Boss does offer a few tracks of prime Ashford and Simpson-helmed disco-pop. Foremost among them are the title track (also heard on this augmented CD reissue in an even better 12-inch remix), &quot;No One Gets the Prize,&quot; and &quot;I Ain't Been Licked.&quot; All three offer a mix of sass and vulnerability that's among the diva's most pleasing stances. &quot;All for One&quot; and &quot;I'm in the World&quot; try too hard in their ways to reinvent Ross's showbizzy anthem &quot;Reach Out and Touch,&quot; but neither truly offends.&quot;\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nThe Boss\n========\n\n01.
