Downloading also means uploading, and the amounts of each are linked, to ensure fairness and rapidity in the spread of the file at hand.\n\nTo be able to download a file, you first need to get the associated .torrent file. This file, usually a dozen KB in size, is the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsignatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the much bigger file to be downloaded, and it needs special software to be read properly. Azureus is one of those types of software.\n\nIf you want to host files yourself, you need a tracker, which is basically a central server coordinating the connections between peers.\nAzureus can provide a tracker too.\n\nYou will find, as you discover its functionality, that it is easy to customize your copy of Azureus to exactly fit your needs.\n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|Vuze_4.2.0.8_macosx.dmg|11497472|4C6DF0BF154685CEFCB6BEEE71A05F9C|h=K547OOM4AHC7Q36JUNMHCUQ2EFQVRKRS|/\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n   \n4.2.0.8 - August 26, 2009\n\nNew Features:\n\nCore | Drive Detection for Devices for OSX (for PSP devices) \n\nCore | Factory option to allow switchable unchoke algorithms \n\n\nChanges:\n\nUI | Less CPU usage for Seeding Rules \n\n\nCore | Only create the transcode directories when required \n\nCore | Allow OSX platform component to be updated properly \n\n\nCorrected bugs:\n\nUI | Fixed Speedtest not working \n\nUI | OSX 10.6 support (opening torrent from file) \n\n\nCore | OSX 10.6 support (not getting data from connected peers) \n\nCore | Fixed deadlock during UI initialisation \n\n\n4.2.0.6 - August 06, 2009\n\nNew Features:\n\nUI | Support delete key for deleting transcoded content \n\nUI | Added visual indication of buddy shares \n\nUI | Added toolbar enablers for deleting subscriptions and devices \n\n\nCore | Support for TiVo device \n\nCore | Support for PSP device \n\nCore | Added RSS feed generation for device's transcoded content \n\nCore | File-based RSS feeds \n\nCore | Added ability to set category for downloads from a subscription \n\n\nChanges:\n\nUI | Moved Column Setup and column related menu items to right click of column header \n\nUI | Made Library/My Torrents filter more visible \n\nUI | Moved &quot;Rename&quot; context menu in Library to context menu of Name column only \n\nUI | Gray out non-active devices \n\n\nCore | Added more meta data for devices RSS Feed \n\nPlug | Added lifetime controls to DHT puts \n\n\nCorrected bugs:\n\nCore | HTTP seeding was incorrectly handling byte range requests \n\nCore | Catch failed transcodes and prevent partial files from being produced \n\nCore | Fixed potential deadlock on startup with Device loading \n\nCore | Support UTF marker chars in RSS feeds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0862e1ee175fe724659394f59328bd251d46744","amp;dn":"Vuze+4.2.0.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0862e1ee175fe724659394f59328bd251d46744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,134,46,30,225,117,254,114,70,89,57,79,89,50,139,210,81,212,103,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
