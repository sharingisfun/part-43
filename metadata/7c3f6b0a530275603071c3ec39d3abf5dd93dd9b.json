That radical re-interpretation is based on the tenets offered in the secret teachings of Rosicrucians, esoteric Freemasonry, Sufism and Kabbalism, among others, with additional references to Eastern religions and Greek and Roman mythology. According to Booth, these teachings inspire the cosmic mind that brought into being the material universe. Booth's history incorporates so many disparate philosophies, many of them far, far away from the mainstream, that it lacks all coherence. And his universe is full of bizarre theories, entertaining primarily for their weirdness. For example, he posits that the angels in the ancient Hebrew Book of Enoch who became sexually attracted to human women are none other than the Gods of Olympus. It is hard to imagine that readers without Booth's predilections for the metaphysical will find this to be anything more than an earnest curiosity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c3f6b0a530275603071c3ec39d3abf5dd93dd9b","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Black+%2F+Mark+Booth+-+The+Secret+History+of+the+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c3f6b0a530275603071c3ec39d3abf5dd93dd9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,63,107,10,83,2,117,96,48,113,195,236,57,211,171,245,221,147,221,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
