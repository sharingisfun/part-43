One trainer moves into the house to try and \n\nget a contestant to open up, and later, one team wins the chance \n\nto block someone's weight on the scale at a wild physical and \n\nmental challenge that finds them pushing a train 800 feet while \n\nanswering food fact questions along the way. Then one player \n\nreaches a milestone at the weigh-in before another contestant is \n\neliminated and sent home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7089a45e73cd6934ba23bcc6b3f607978bc6519e","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.S11E07.HDTV.XviD-LW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7089a45e73cd6934ba23bcc6b3f607978bc6519e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,137,164,94,115,205,105,52,186,35,188,198,179,246,7,151,139,198,81,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
