It is the first game in the Empire Earth series. It has been described as very similar to the Age of Empires series,[2] and received positive reviews.[3]\n\nThe game requires players to use citizens to collect resources and construct buildings and produce military units to conquer opposing civilizations.[4][5] Empire Earth spans 500,000 years of world history, which is divided into 14 epochs, beginning with the prehistoric age, and ending with the nano age.[6]\n\nAn expansion pack was developed by Mad Doc Software called Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest, which was released on September 17, 2002. It added new features such as a special power for each civilization, and a new 15th epoch, entitled the Space Age, which focuses on the colonization of space planets.[7\n\nA little known fact about the game that it is one of the best games to hit the market, better than the series featuring EE1, 2, and 3.\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEmpire Earth averaged an 82% according to Game Rankings,[22] and earned GameSpy\\'s 2001 \\&quot;PC Game of the Year \\&quot; award.[23] It was rated 8.5/10 by IGN, who commented \\&quot;Anyone who\\'s familiar with Age of Empires is going to hit the ground running in Empire Earth. With a few additions and some small changes the economic model and interface is pretty much exactly like that in AoE2.\\&quot;[24] GameSpot was not as impressed, giving it 7.9/10, saying \\&quot;Empire Earth is best reserved for hard-core real-time strategy players who won\\'t mind the game\\'s less-than-stellar graphics and sound but will instead relish the ability to relive 14 different epochs of human warfare.\\&quot;.[2] Game Informer was disappointed and gave it a 6.25/10, saying \\&quot;Empire Earth couldn\\'t walk the walk like it talked the talk. Although no one patch can fix either of the aforementioned items, the latter will certainly see some type of quick adjustment in the near future.\\&quot;[25]\n\nEmpire Earth sold over 1 million units.[26] Empire Earth was re-released as Empire Earth Gold Edition on May 6, 2003. It contains both the original game and the expansion pack, manuals, and technology trees for both games, hotkey reference and the official strategy guide.\n\n[edit] LegacyEmpire Earth spawned several sequels, and eventually an expansion pack for Empire Earth, Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest was released in May 2002, and a sequel, Empire Earth II, was released in 2005. Empires: Dawn of the Modern World was considered to be a \\&quot;spiritual sequel\\&quot; to Empire Earth, since it was also made by Stainless Steel Studios and released between Empire Earth and Empire Earth II.[27] A cell phone version of Empire Earth, Empire Earth Mobile, was released in 2005. Another sequel, Empire Earth III was released November 6, 2007.[28]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51a5addd468df77e6373c9d342b1a72333e06d2","amp;dn":"%28FULL+PC+GAME%29+Empire+Earth+%28PC_SLLPER%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51a5addd468df77e6373c9d342b1a72333e06d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,26,90,221,212,104,223,119,230,55,60,157,52,43,26,114,51,62,6,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
