This place is been used now as a lovers lane by teens.\n\nSome kids playing a prank on some love-lorn teens are the first ones to face the wrath of the witch. Soon the Rev. David Thompson (James Houghton) is called in to investigate.\n\nBut will he be able to stop this evil? It is for you to find out.\n\nExcellent special effects and background music. The acting is adequate for a horror film. Those of you who are squeamish and faint of heart shouldn't watch this film alone.\n\nAn interesting film for your horror movies collection. \n\nPoster:\n\n\nThis file can be played with any DIVX/MP4 compatible DVD/VCD Player.
