This contains most of the songs from his and Garfunkel's ground-breaking album &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot; but in their original form with just Paul performing by himself. \n\nThey were relesed after S and G's first album &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3 AM&quot; flopped, even though it had the best acoustic ballad of all time. Paul went it alone in England with this Dylan-esque lament of the soulful Christian in the world of the neon satan. All your favorites in their naked form.\n\nPaul Simon is a great and poetic performer.\n\n  [1] I Am a Rock\n  [2] Leaves that are Green\n  [3] A Church is Burning\n  [4] April\n  [5] The Sound of Silence\n  [6] A Most Perculiar Man\n  [7] He Was My brother\n  [8] Kathys Song\n  [9] The Side of a Hill\n [10] A Simple Desultory Phillipic\n [11] Flowers Never Bend with the Rainfall\n [12] Patterns","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768c197137a03fd817e695d930e0f645b37c926b","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+Song+Book+%281964%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768c197137a03fd817e695d930e0f645b37c926b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,140,25,113,55,160,63,216,23,230,149,217,48,224,246,69,179,124,146,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
