Most of the numbers are standards, including &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; &quot;Lover Man,&quot; and &quot;Lush Life,&quot; and are performed by the saxophonist backed by a solid rhythm section.  Dave Burrell is wonderfully deft on piano, and he is given ample opportunity to interact with Shepp.  Annette Lowman sings on several numbers, and she adds just the right touch and phrasing.  Shepp is in somewhat less than perfect form, but he is clearly enjoying himself.  There is a touch of a blues and R&amp;B feel that adds to the ambiance.  Unlike some of Shepp's other ventures, there are no attempted serious statements made -- only relaxing, good, swinging jazz that lifts the spirits or touches the soul, if only just a bit. ~ Steven Loewy, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nArchie Shepp (Saxophone) \nAnnette Lowman (Vocals) \nDave Burrell (Piano) \nHerman Wright (Double Bass) \nSteve McRaven (Drums) \n\nArchie Shepp Quintet - Lover Man Tracks: \n01  Stars in Your Eyes (Lopez Mendez/Mort Green/Gabriel Ruiz) 7:20 \n02  Lover Man (Jimmy Davis/Roger &quot;Ram&quot; Ramirez/Jimmy Sherman) 6:05 \n03  Brandnew World/Breaking a New Day (Archie Shepp) 9:22 \n04  Yesterday's (Otto Harbach/Jerome Kern) 5:15 \n05  My Funny Valentine (Richard Rodgers/Lorentz Hart) 5:21 \n06  Lush Life (Billy Strayhorn) 6:48 \n07  Squeeze Me (Fats Waller/Clarence Williams) 6:17 \n08  Margy Pargy (Archie Shepp) 5:18 \n09  Tribute to Bessie Smith (Archie Shepp) 7:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c69f6a4ab55b61d7a303c332fa37b0d80901c63","amp;dn":"Archie+Shepp+Quintet+-+Lover+Man+%281988%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c69f6a4ab55b61d7a303c332fa37b0d80901c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,105,246,164,171,85,182,29,122,48,60,51,47,163,123,13,128,144,28,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
