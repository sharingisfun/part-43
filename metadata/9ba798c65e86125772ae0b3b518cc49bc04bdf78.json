Seals' slashing guitar work is all over this recording, which focuses on many of the best songs from his first two albums. During the fifth song of the set, Seals delights the audience by introducing legendary Texas guitar-slinger Johnny Winter to the stage. For the next half-hour, Winter joins the group, taking it to another level for the remainder of this blistering performance.\n\n01. Hot Sauce 5:00\n02. Sitting At My Window 7:05\n03.
