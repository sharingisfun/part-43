The official Vangelis version was not available until long after the release of the movie, and I suppose I've become rather accustomed to the this release, since when I finally got to hear the Vangelis album, I found I preferred the adaptation. If you are a Blade Runner fan and not hate classical music, then this will surely please you. \n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 4\nArtist: Vangelis - The New American Orchestra\nAlbum: Blade Runner\nYear: 1982\nGenre: Soundtrack\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5094d5bf25662cce20d704127c4d8ce78f783c0f","amp;dn":"Vangelis+-+Blade+Runner+%5BFLAC-1982%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5094d5bf25662cce20d704127c4d8ce78f783c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,148,213,191,37,102,44,206,32,215,4,18,124,77,140,231,143,120,60,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
