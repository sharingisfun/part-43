Much software now in use was developed with little input or beta testing from classroom teachers. Teacher Studio was designed by a working classroom teacher with 3 simple rules: the software should be elegant, powerful, and simple to use. \n\nElegant: all of the different modules are unified under one application and use the elegance of Apple's current software products. Our design helps minimize the learning curve for our end users. No more having to use multiple software from multiple developers. No more having to deal with all of those individual developers. One beautiful look in one place!\n\nPowerful: calculate and save changes behind the scenes, protect teachers from having to deal with grade averages, score calculations, finding out which assignments are missing from students, and so on.... Click, click, click and go! \n\nSimple: everything you need to do is 3 clicks or less away\n\nInstructions.\n1. Unzip all files\n2. Move .app to the Applications Folder\n3. Generate a Serial using the Keygen\n4. Register the App\n5. Enjoy!!!  \n\nBy AJhacks\n\nA Team ReApp Release\n\nFollow Me On Twitter\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5519af988d9fe04af062d477679fb871cfbe2d0d","amp;dn":"Teacher+Studio+%28Mac+App+Store%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5519af988d9fe04af062d477679fb871cfbe2d0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,25,175,152,141,159,224,74,240,98,212,119,103,159,184,113,207,190,45,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
