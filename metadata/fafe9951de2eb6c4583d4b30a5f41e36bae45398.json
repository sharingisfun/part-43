Other stars included Angie Dickinson, Cesar Romero, Richard Conte, Akim Tamiroff, Henry Silva, Ilka Chase, Norman Fell, Harry Wilson, and Buddy Lester, as well as uncredited cameo appearances by Shirley MacLaine, Red Skelton, and George Raft. The title of this film is also often presented as Ocean's 11.[/quote]\n\n[b]Imdb user Comment:[/b]\n[quote]Leave it to the Chairman of the Board to rope in a great director for the first Rat Pack movie. Lewis Milestone (All Quiet on the Western Front) indeed directed this 1960 caper movie starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop; but the results now seem like more of a historical artifact than a good time. The tone of the film is curiously serious--one somehow expected that the Rat Pack would have made a more buoyant first picture. But it is something to see these guys together, if largely for nostalgia reasons.[/quote]\n\n[b]File Info[/b]\n[b]Video Codec[/b]: XviD  /  [b]Video Bitrate[/b]: 714 Kbps\n[b]Audio Codec[/b]: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3  /  [b]Audio Bitrate[/b]: 32 Kbps\n[b]Resolution[/b]: 608 x 256  /  [b]Frame Rate[/b]: 23.976 fps  /  [b]Size[/b]: 699,69 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fafe9951de2eb6c4583d4b30a5f41e36bae45398","amp;dn":"OCEAN%5C%27S+11-1960-Kusuku+jiLAiaa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fafe9951de2eb6c4583d4b30a5f41e36bae45398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,254,153,81,222,46,182,196,88,61,75,48,165,244,30,54,186,228,83,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
