This is probably the only album where you'll hear stars like John Travolta sing about their religion, with lyrics like &quot;Take the route of auditing and once again be free.&quot;, or the &quot;lullaby&quot; &quot;The Worried Being&quot; that ends with &quot;And then they gave him Scientology&quot; to which the children's choir respond &quot;Hooray! He was free!&quot;. \n\nFrank Stallone gets a solo number, the catchy &quot;The Evil Purpose&quot;, with lyrics like &quot;In modern times the scientists / wag their heads disheveled / Wondering why psychiatrists / Leave the whole world bedeviled&quot;, and the nonsensical chorus &quot;Puzzle, puzzle, trouble, trouble / Arcane? Insane? Spirit? Brain?&quot;\n\nAnd once you've made it through the album none other than L. Ron Hubbard, who composed all the songs, sings &quot;Thank you for listening / I write just for you&quot; (This must be heard to be believed)\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;The Road to Freedom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34 performed by John Travolta, Leif Garrett, Frank Stallone, Lee Purcell.\n   2. &quot;The Way to Happiness&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:43 performed by Leif Garrett, Gayle Moran, Nicky Hopkins.\n   3. &quot;The Worried Being&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 performed by Amanda Ambrose.\n   4. &quot;The Evil Purpose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 performed by Frank Stallone.\n   5. &quot;Laugh a Little&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37 performed by Michael Roberts, Pam Roberts, Margie Nelson.\n   6. &quot;The Good Go Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 performed by David Pomerantz.\n   7. &quot;Why Worship Death?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16 performed by Chick Corea, Julia Migenes.\n   8. &quot;Make It Go Right&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59 performed by David Pomerantz.\n   9. &quot;The ARC Song&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:19 performed by John Travolta, Karen Black, Jeff Pomerantz, Frank Stallone, Lee Purcell, Gloria Rusch.\n  10. &quot;LÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢envoi, Thank You for Listening&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:25 performed by L.
