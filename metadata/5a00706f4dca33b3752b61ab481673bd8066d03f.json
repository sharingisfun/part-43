The crew consists of Letty, Rico, Tego and Han Lue. After a heist, Dominic believes that the trail is too hot and leaves Letty to go elsewhere. While he is in Panama City, Toretto gets a call from his sister Mia. She tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dom heads back to Los Angeles and examines the car crash that Letty was in and finds traces of nitromethane. Dom then goes to the only car mechanic that uses nitromethane and coerces him into giving him the name David Park, the man who ordered the fuel.\nMeanwhile, FBI agent Brian O'Conner is trying to track down a drug dealer named Arturo Braga. His search leads him to David Park. Dom arrives at Park's apartment first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before letting go. Brian, who was also on his way to Park's place, saves Park and Park becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian into a street race through Los Angeles; the winner will become the last driver on a team that traffics heroin between the United States-Mexico border for Braga. Dom also shows up to race. At the end, Dom and Brian are neck-and-neck, and Dom wins when he hits Brian's rear fender and causes him to spin out. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a00706f4dca33b3752b61ab481673bd8066d03f","amp;dn":"The+Fast+And+The+Furious+4+%282009%29+-+Paul+Walker+-+Vin+Diesel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a00706f4dca33b3752b61ab481673bd8066d03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,0,112,111,77,202,51,179,117,43,97,171,72,22,115,189,128,102,208,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
