Ignoring Sailor's probation, they set out for California. However their mother hires a killer to hunt down Sailor. Unaware of this, the two enjoy their journey and themselves being together... until they witness a young woman dying after a car accident - a bad omen.

During their journey, Lula and Sailor relate the events of their lives to date, while encountering a typical gallery of Lynch grotesques. After being stranded in a small town, Sailor agrees to join the loathsome Bobby Peru in a criminal venture.

Lula's mother sends out a private detective and a hitman after them. Sailor and Lula encounter an assortment of extremely bizarre &quot;people&quot; while discovering hidden secrets about one another. Full of lurid imagery and references to The Wizard of Oz. Written by Jennifer Harrison\n\nSailor and Lula are two rebelious kids. Lula's mother hates Sailor, and pays a man to attack him. Sailor kills the attacker, and ends up in jail. Lula waits for him to be released, teams up with him, and they both cross the country trying to stay one step ahead of the mother...

Sailor and Lula are amalgamations of distanciated American iconography. Their horizons are constituted by little more than TV; they think they're wild at heart; and their romance sets them off on a post industrial Odyssey. Written by Mark C.

Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; MALWARE!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents:\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n\nALWAYS SEED!\n\n\n\nQuicktime for iPod","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74853504975a1cbc8fb871095d0082c4c55413e","amp;dn":"Wild+at+Heart+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74853504975a1cbc8fb871095d0082c4c55413e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,72,83,80,73,117,161,203,200,251,135,16,149,208,8,44,76,85,65,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
