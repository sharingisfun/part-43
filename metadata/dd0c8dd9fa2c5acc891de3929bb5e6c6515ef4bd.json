As soon as the young rockers check in, they immediately begin seeing and hearing strange phenomenon. Mysteriously, the temperature in their hotel room escalates and they remove the ceiling tiles to let the heat out. One at time the people gaze into the ceiling duct, turn crazed, and flee the scene. It seems that each person witnessed the a ghostly entity who not only scared them to death but placed a curse on them as well. \n\nIt is soon revealed that the malevolent spirit belongs to a young prostitute who was brutally killed and in that same hotel room. The murderer decapitated the young prostitute, and placed her head up in the air conditioning system above that same ceiling vent. The cursed and scared musicians quickly meet their deaths in mysterious ways. When the remaining youths realize what is happening to them, they seek the aid of a wise monk at a nearby Buddhist temple. The Monk tells them the only way to break the curse is too desecrate the grave yards and dig up the coffins of those people who have died a violent death. \n\nFurthermore, they must sleep in the coffins of the people they dug up in order to completely break the spell. The remaining musicians must use all their resources to beat the curse and uncover the mystery behind the prostitutes death in order to survive.\n\n===========\n\nFirst time director Thiwa MeyathaisongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s low budget Thailand film THE SISTERS (original title Pee Chong Air), owes its very existence to the likes of superior Asian horror fare such as THE GRUDGE, JU-ON, and especially A TALE OF TWO SISTERS. Like many recent Thai/Korean horror efforts, THE SISTERS is supposedly based on a true incident (yeah right, and so was BLAIR WITCH PROJECT). \n\nThiwa Meyathaisong demonstrates his flair for the horror genre by taking an acid trip approach; tossing the logic out the window is fine with me. Asian genre films have a habit of over-explaining things to the point of tedium, and I find this approach adds a layer of mystery to the whole affair. Meyathaisong also tries hard to make the film grim and depressing without splashing blood everywhere. He ensures that there is some genuine creepy dread to THE SISTERS. The photography is also brilliantly done and the color schemes enhance the look of the film. Ditto the soundtrack contributed to the dark and trippy tone of THE SISTERS.\n\nMost Thai low budget features contain some truly horrid acting, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m happy to report that the cast of THE SISTERS is well above the usual standards. Like those others films mentioned earlier, THE SISTERS offers up most of its scares through jumps, cuts, and sound effects. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen all this before in many other Asian horror fare; you know the ones IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m talking aboutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½how many ghostly Asian female teenagers with long flowing hair and wearing white contact lenses do we have to endure? Okay, original THE SISTERS is not. \n\nBut despite all the redundancy, Meyathaisong manages to squeeze all the horror and intrigue from the elements weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve all seen before. And he keeps the narrative flowing by incorporating flashbacks and implementing oddly artistic camera angles and lighting. The director consistently controls the suspense and pacing by subtly dropping clues about what is going to happen, yet never revealing the major secrets of THE SISTERS.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd0c8dd9fa2c5acc891de3929bb5e6c6515ef4bd","amp;dn":"Thai+Movie+-+Pee+Chong+Air+%28aka+The+Sisters%29+-+Horror%2C+2004.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd0c8dd9fa2c5acc891de3929bb5e6c6515ef4bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,12,141,217,250,44,90,204,137,29,227,146,155,181,230,198,81,94,244,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
