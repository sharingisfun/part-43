The books can be enjoyed in any order as there is no series continuity in terms of plot or character/relationship development. Although this is the first of the series, I wouldn't advise basing the quality of the series as a whole on this first effort. It's not a bad book but the series does improve in later novels.\nBrief synopsis:\nPrivate detective Lou Archer is hired by the wife of a wealthy man to investigate her husband's  sudden disappearance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7d96f90f61c19c06fc5dcb37aa8b70ebf99d97","amp;dn":"Ross+MacDonald+-+The+Moving+Target+%28A+Lou+Archer+Novel+Unabridge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d7d96f90f61c19c06fc5dcb37aa8b70ebf99d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,125,150,249,15,97,193,156,6,252,93,203,55,170,139,112,235,249,157,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
