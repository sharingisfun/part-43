With thirteen new songs, Satriani completes\nhis transformation from stunning instrumentalist to fully-realized artist. Since\nthe late 80's, the guitar virtuoso has been winning over fans and musicians\nalike with his groundbreaking style and legendary sounds.\n\nCo-Produced by Satriani and Mike Fraser (AC/DC), Super Colossal features Satriani\nperforming on all of the guitar and bass parts. Live drums were cut on four\ntracks by session giant Simon Phillips, the rest were played by Satriani's\nlongtime collaborator Jeff Campitelli. The 13 diverse tracks on the album range\nfrom the title track's thundering, foot-stomp beat and intricately textured lead\nline, to the spiritual intensity of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Love EternalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the raucous, party-down\nexhilaration of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCrowd Chant.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOn the day of the album's release, Satriani will begin a west coast trek, making\nspecial in-store appearances. Soon after, he will launch a full U.S. tour\nbeginning on April 1st in Denver.\n\nQuite comfortable on the road, Satriani set out on his most ambitious worldwide\ntour yet in April 2004. Hitting 25 countries, playing 105 shows to over 500,000\npeople and logging in over 150,000 miles, Satriani wrapped up this worldwide trek\nin May 2005 by playing to over 20,000 people at three sold-out shows in India.\n\nThis year marks Satriani's 20-year anniversary as a solo artist, his first album,\nNot Of This Earth, was released in 1986. Over the course of his illustrious\ncareer, Satriani has achieved huge success, selling more than 10 million albums &amp;\nDVDs worldwide with 12 solo albums (2 platinum, 4 gold) and 3 platinum DVD's, as\nwell as garnering 13 Grammy nominations.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebcd2bebdae787e2ea9acd0739ac25012a285e65","amp;dn":"Joe+Satriani-Super_Colossal-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebcd2bebdae787e2ea9acd0739ac25012a285e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,205,43,235,218,231,135,226,234,154,205,7,57,172,37,1,42,40,94,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
