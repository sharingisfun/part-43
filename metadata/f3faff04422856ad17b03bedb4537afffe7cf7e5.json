The film chronicles the chaos that results when a prominent American Nobel Prize winner arrives in BahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a, with nothing but praise on his lips for a long-forgotten local writer-scientist named Pedro Archanjo. When the media finally discover who Archanjo was and what he espoused, they are completely horrified to discover that he was a man who believed that the way to improve the lot of humanity was for people of various races to marry and have children by one another in mixed-race marriages. Further, Archanjo clearly acted on his beliefs. The rampant racism of Brazilians, which is almost never discussed, is completely exposed. Flashbacks show Brazilians listening with approving interest to talks by Nazi race-theoreticians in the 1930s. In the present, the American is seen to be applying Archanjo's theories, by having an affair with a local mestizo woman. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Tenda dos Milagres - Nelson Pereira dos Santos (1977).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 699 MiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 710 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.0 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2117/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2117/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 577 Kbps\n      Width : 480 pixels\n      Height : 320 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.500\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.155\n      StreamSize : 563 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 2h 16mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 123 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.95 \n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nIMDB: tt0080004\n\nVHS Rip (Very good quality)\n\nPortuguese audio, no subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by borispetrov","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3faff04422856ad17b03bedb4537afffe7cf7e5","amp;dn":"Tenda+dos+Milagres+-+Nelson+Pereira+dos+Santos+%281977%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3faff04422856ad17b03bedb4537afffe7cf7e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,250,255,4,66,40,86,173,23,176,59,237,180,83,122,255,254,124,247,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
