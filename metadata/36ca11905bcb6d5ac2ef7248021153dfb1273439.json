There are two stand-out classics on this album.  The first is the live recording of &quot;Los Bandidos&quot; which is awesome and a reworking of &quot;Samba Do SueÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ho&quot; from the classic &quot;Bamboleate&quot; album with Eddie Palmieri.  This version of &quot;Samba Do SueÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ho&quot; is more uptempo with an incredibly tight and slamming rhythm section.  It also has a fantastic piano solo by Al Zulacia.  This version just keeps getting better and better so grab it because it's hot!\n\nDue to the popularity of 'Samba do Suenho', this was a very sought after album by 'rare groove' DJs in the 1990s.  But all tracks are great here.  It's surely one of the most consistent sessions Tjader did for Verve and it's one of his purest latin jazz sessions of the '60s, too.\n\nPersonnel for all tracks except B1, B4:\nCal Tjader (vib)\nChick Corea (p)\nDerek Smith (org)\nBobby Rodriguez (b)\nGrady Tate (d)\nRay Barretto, Armando Peraza (per)\nChico O'Farrill (arr, cond)\n\nPersonnel for B1, B4:\nCal Tjader (vib)\nAl Zulaica (p)\nStan Gilbert (b)\nCarl Burnett (d)\nArmando Peraza (cga)\n\nCal Tjader - Along Comes Cal Tracks:\nSide A\n01  Quando Quando Que Sera (Farrill/Marak)\n02  Round Midnight (Bernie Hanighen/Thelonious Monk/Cootie Williams)\n03  Trick Or Treat (Teddy Randazzo/Victoria Pike)\n04  Yellow Days (Alan Bernstein/Alvaro Carrillo)\n05  Our Day Will Come (Mort Garson/Bob Hilliard)\n06  Along Comes Marry (Tandyn Almer)\n\nSide B\n01  Los Bandidos (Cal Tjader)\n02  Similau (Arden Clar/Harry Coleman)\n03  Green Peppers (Sol Lake)\n04  Samba Do Suenho (Cal Tjader)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ca11905bcb6d5ac2ef7248021153dfb1273439","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Along+Comes+Cal+%281967%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ca11905bcb6d5ac2ef7248021153dfb1273439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,202,17,144,91,203,109,90,194,239,114,72,2,17,83,223,177,39,52,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
