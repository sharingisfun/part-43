Alongside the body is a series of baffling ciphers. Langdon and a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, are stunned to find a trail that leads to the works of Da Vinci - and further. The curator, part of a secret society named the Priory of Sion, may have sacrificed his life to keep secret the location of a vastly important religious relic hidden for centuries. It appears that the clandestine Vatican-sanctioned Catholic sect Opus Dei has now made its move. Unless Landon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine code and quickly assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the Priory's secret - and a stunning historical truth - will be lost forever.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b94f1f82b08773d2245da553b3a1689fc89a352c","amp;dn":"Dan+Brown+-+The+Da-Vinci+Code+%28Ebook%29+-+lg1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b94f1f82b08773d2245da553b3a1689fc89a352c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,79,31,130,176,135,115,210,36,93,165,83,179,161,104,159,200,154,53,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
