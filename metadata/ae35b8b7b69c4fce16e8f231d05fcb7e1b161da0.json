There is a 720p version of this but don't bother, it is upscaled and contains no more detail. This took me a very long time to obtain so I am going to repost the torrent I found elsewhere here and seed for the rest of this year. This version of Ergo Proxy is not excessively large, anamorphic, dual audio, and a full resolution capture. Only negative I can find is with the yellow boxy softsub text typically found on dvd's. \n\n------details--------------------------------\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 720x480 (853:480) 29.97fps - (Anamorphic)\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz 6ch - (Japanese/English)\nSubtitle: VobSub - (English)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nBefore any windows users complain about it being mkv's, wrong audio, or no picture do the following.\n\n1. Remove existing media players and codecs. (Divx, RealONE, Quicktime, etc etc.)\n2. Go to free-codecs.com and get the following:\n-Media Player Classic (Preferably not MPC-Home Cinema.) \n-Real Alternative \n-Quick Alternative (not lite)\n-Combined Community Codec Pack\n-Windows Media Format 11 Runtime (Windows Media support without installing WMP 11)\n\n\n\nInstall everything, fairly straight forward unless you're a moron. \nDon't bother installing the media players that come with Real, Quick, or CCCP. \nOmit WMF 11 runtime if you already have WMP 11 by default of your O/S (vista/7). \n\nPlace the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; executable in a folder of your choice on the C: drive.\n(e.g. c:/misc/mpc/mplayerc.exe) The exe is a self contained program. Double click to open it. \nIf you are using Vista or Win7 right click and open it as Administrator. (1 time)\n\nNext go to VIEW &gt; OPTIONS &gt; &quot;FORMATS&quot;\n\nPress the &quot;VIDEO&quot; button\n\nNow go to &quot;Audio Switcher&quot; and tick &quot;NORMALIZE&quot; on.\n\nPress the &quot;APPLY&quot; button.\n\nPress the &quot;OK&quot; button\n\nNow simply navigate to your files with Windows Explorer and double click any video file. They will then open with MPC and you will notice that they take a fraction of the time to open than they did with any bloated, inconsistent, &amp; confusing media player you have used before.\n\n(If you use CoreAVC Pro for hd movies omit h.264 support in CCCP.)\n\n------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae35b8b7b69c4fce16e8f231d05fcb7e1b161da0","amp;dn":"ERGO+PROXY+-+Dual+Audio+-+Anamorphic+-+%5BArigatou%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae35b8b7b69c4fce16e8f231d05fcb7e1b161da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,53,184,183,182,156,79,206,22,232,242,49,208,95,203,126,27,22,29,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
