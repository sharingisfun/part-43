In Toshio MatsumotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s controversial debut feature, seemingly nothing is taboo: neither the incorporation of visual flourishes straight from the worlds of contemporary graphic-design, painting, comic-books, and animation; nor the unflinching depiction of nudity, sex, drug-use, and public-toilets. But of all the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtransgressionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ here on display, perhaps one in particular stands out the most: the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking and unapologetic portrayal of Japanese gay subculture.\n\nCross-dressing club-kid Eddie (played by real-life transvestite entertainer extraordinaire Peter, famed for his role as Kyoami the Fool in Akira KurosawaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ran) vies with a rival drag-queen (Osamu Ogasawara) for the favours of drug-dealing cabaret-manager Gonda (Yoshio Tsuchiya, himself a Kurosawa player who appeared in such films as Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood, and High and Low). Passions escalate and blood begins to flow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ before all tensions are released in a jolting climax that prefigures by nearly thirty years Tsai Ming-liangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s similarly scandalous The River.\n\nWith its mixture of purely narrative sequences and documentary footage, Funeral Parade of Roses comes to us from a moment when cinema set itself to test, and even eradicate, the boundaries between fiction and reality, desire and experience; consequently, the film shares a kinship with such other 1969 works as Masahiro ShinodaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Double Suicide and Ingmar BergmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Passion [The Passion of Anna]. Yet Matsumoto achieves a zig-zag modulation between pathos and hilarity that makes his picture utterly unique: a filmic howl in the face of social, moral, and artistic convention.\n\n[ Video ]\nx264\nDuration 1h 44mn\nBit rate 1 950 Kbps\nNominal bit rate 2 000 Kbps\nWidth 720 pixels\nHeight 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio 4/3\nFrame rate 23.976 fps\n\n[ Audio - Track 1 ]\nFormat AC-3\nBit rate 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) 2 channels\nLanguage Japanese\nSubtitles English\n\n[ Audio - Track 2 (Director's Commentary) ]\nFormat AC-3\nBit rate 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) 2 channels\nLanguage Japanese\nSubtitles English\n\n[KARiNA]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e8dda87be769af816705dab8793522f957f26b","amp;dn":"Funeral.Parade.of.Roses.1969.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e8dda87be769af816705dab8793522f957f26b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,232,221,168,123,231,105,175,129,103,5,218,184,121,53,34,249,87,242,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
