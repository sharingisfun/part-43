Notably, he is one of only 19 people to be twice awarded the Medal of Honor, and one of only three to be awarded a Marine Corps Brevet Medal and a Medal of Honor, and the only person to be awarded a Marine Corps Brevet Medal and a Medal of Honor for two different actions.\n\nIn addition to his military career, Smedley Butler was noted for his outspoken anti-interventionist views, and his book War is a Racket. His book was one of the first works describing the workings of the military-industrial complex and after retiring from service, he became a popular speaker at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists and church groups in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1934, he informed the United States Congress that a group of wealthy industrialists had plotted a military coup known as the Business Plot to overthrow the government.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84c371cc826fd4f6829a8bff98000bb668e31f8a","amp;dn":"Smedley+Darlington+Butler+-+War+is+a+Racket+%281935%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84c371cc826fd4f6829a8bff98000bb668e31f8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,195,113,204,130,111,212,246,130,154,139,255,152,0,11,182,104,227,31,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
