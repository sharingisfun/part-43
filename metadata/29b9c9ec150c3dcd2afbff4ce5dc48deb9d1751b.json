In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack (reportedly his fifth) after overdosing on his muse at his studio.\n\n\nTracks Featured:\n\n\nPlayaz Nite CD DISC 1:\n1.\tIt's Real\n2.\tIce Cream Man, The\n3.\tIt's Going Down\n4.\tPlayaz Nite\n5.\tBad Ways\n6.\tYou Missed\n7.\tKeep It Together\n8.\tHigh Till I Die\n\nPlayaz Nite Songs DISC 2:\n1.\tCome On\n2.\tFlipped Up\n3.\tMake Money\n4.\tRide My Car\n5.\tBoom\n6.\tDedicated\n7.\tWhen We Come Through","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29b9c9ec150c3dcd2afbff4ce5dc48deb9d1751b","amp;dn":"DJ+Screw+-+Playaz+Nite+%5B2+Disc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29b9c9ec150c3dcd2afbff4ce5dc48deb9d1751b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,185,201,236,21,12,61,205,42,251,255,76,229,220,72,222,185,209,117,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
