The film centers on a psychopathic stunt man who stalks young women before murdering them in staged car accidents using his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeath-proofÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ stunt car. The film is a tribute to exploitation, muscle cars, and slasher film genres of the 1970s, and stars Kurt Russell, ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Bell, Rosario Dawson, Vanessa Ferlito, Jordan Ladd, Sydney Tamiia Poitier, Tracie Thoms, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rose McGowan.\n\nDeath Proof was released theatrically in the United States as part of a double feature with Robert RodriguezÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Planet Terror under the collective title Grindhouse in order to replicate the experience of viewing exploitation film double features in a &quot;grindhouse&quot; theater. The films were released separately outside the United States and on DVD, with Death Proof going on sale in the United States on September 18, 2007.\n\nDeath Proof was released in the United States and Canada alongside Planet Terror as part of a double feature under the title Grindhouse. Both films were released separately in extended versions internationally, approximately two months apart. The additional material includes scenes that were replaced in the American theatrical release version with a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmissing reelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ title card, such as the lap dance scene. A total of 27 minutes were added for this version. One of the first screenings of Death Proof was made at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on August 20, 2007, with star ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Bell attending the screenings. The Dutch poster artwork for Death Proof claimed that the film would feature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcoming attractionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Robert Rodriguez. In the United Kingdom, Death Proof was released on September 21, 2007, and in Australia on November 1, 2007. Explaining the split in foreign releases, Tarantino stated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEspecially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really have this tradition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ not only do they not really know what a grindhouse is, they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even have the double feature tradition. So you are kind of trying to teach us something else.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Death Proof (2007)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Death Proof (2007)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 1.11 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 406 Kbps\nMovie name                       : DEATH_PROOF.Title1.DVDRip\nWriting application              : Lavf52.78.4\nOriginal source form/Name        : DEATH_PROOF\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 2\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate                         : 172 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 310 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.032\nStream size                      : 139 MiB (12%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 53mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 24.7 MiB (2%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 37 ms (0.88 video frame)\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 6220\n3/30/2011 2:47:07 PM\nmbam-log-2011-03-30 (14-47-07).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 5\nTime elapsed: 43 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
