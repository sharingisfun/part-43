Whether he played with slides made from bottle necks, or the apocryphal steakbone, Fred's brand of Delta blues was delivered with a solid confidence and an honesty that cuts right into your soul. Fred taught the blues to a generation of rockers; Bonnie Raitt learned slide guitar from him and The Rolling Stones copped &quot;You Got To Move&quot; directly from his original. \n\nTracklist\n1. Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\n2. Big Fat Mama\n3. The Train I Ride\n4. Get Right Church \n5. You Ain't Gonna Worry My Life Anymore (Aka Fred's Worried Life Blues)\n6.
