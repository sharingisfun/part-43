It spells out the unique characteristics of skyscrapers from a security and fire life safety perspective, details the type of security and life safety systems commonly found in them, outlines how to conduct risk assessments, and explains security policies and procedures designed to protect life and property. Craighead also provides guidelines for managing security and life safety functions, including the development of response plans for building emergencies. This latest edition clearly separates out the different types of skyscrapers, from office buildings to hotels to condominiums to mixed-use buildings, and explains how different patterns of use and types of tenancy impact building security and life safety.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768fb0633f84151604c975e85aa71aa25ea88a7e","amp;dn":"High-Rise+Security+and+Fire+Life+Safety+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768fb0633f84151604c975e85aa71aa25ea88a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,143,176,99,63,132,21,22,4,201,117,232,90,167,26,162,94,168,138,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
