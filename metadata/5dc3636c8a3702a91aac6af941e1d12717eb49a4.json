The series was written by Si Spencer, with some script consultation done by Neil Gaiman, and illustrated by Dean Ormston.\n\nThe series depicts the events that take place on two fictional worlds, both of which are connected through an alternate version of the character Timothy Hunter.  When Timothy Hunter first appeared he was a young boy who had the potential to be the world's most powerful magic user. He starred in his own series titled The Books of Magic, written by Neil Gaiman. Over the course of the character's history he changed and aged.\n\nThe idea behind Books of Magick: Life During Wartime was to present a more mature version of The Books of Magic without the character's past continuity attached. During the planning stage a problem appeared. A series of books based on the comics and also titled The Books of Magic had been released and marketed in this form to children. Books of Magick: Life During Wartime depicts nudity and sex, as well as a higher degree of violence than The Books of Magic. Although tastefully depicted these things make it a series inappropriate for children and there were fears that the new series and the books could be confused in some sectors. The decision to change 'Magic' to 'Magick' and to add the words 'Life During Wartime' was made and the series went forward.\n\nThe true Earth of this series is a world upon which humans (known as the Bred) live side-by-side with members of the races of Faerie (known as the Born). It is a world torn by war. On one side is the ruling elite made exclusively of Born. On the other is the Coalition made up of both Born and Bred. The majority on both sides are members of the same religion. They worship Tim Hunter as a god under the name The Hunter.\n\nThe second Earth is known as Hunter's World and was created by Hunter as a means of protection and escape. The things he was running from were magic, war, and religion. As a result when he created Hunter's World none of those things existed there.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dc3636c8a3702a91aac6af941e1d12717eb49a4","amp;dn":"Books+of+Magick+-+Life+During+Wartime","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dc3636c8a3702a91aac6af941e1d12717eb49a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,195,99,108,138,55,2,169,26,172,106,249,65,225,209,39,23,235,73,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
