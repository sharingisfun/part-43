Winds of 130 miles per hour raged all night, and storm surge drowned much of the Irrawaddy Delta in over 12 feet of water. Whole villages vanished, at least 130,000 people died, and two million were left homeless, making Cyclone Nargis the worst natural disaster in BurmaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s history. Among the survivors were thousands of children orphaned or separated from their parents.\n\nEyes of the Storm tells the struggles of several orphaned children left to fend for themselves and rebuild their shattered lives in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis.  Among others we meet 10-year-old Ye Pyint who is now surrogate father to his younger brother and sister; they live in a makeshift hut in what remains of their village. We follow Min, the 16-year-old who is the sole survivor from his family and is now trying to live as a monk in a Buddhist monastery miles away from his devastated home.\n\nThrough the eyes of the Burmese filmmaking team who shot undercover for over 10 months in defiance of the ruling juntaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s media blackout, WIDE ANGLE provides a rare window into one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most secretive countries. The hour-long documentary also features American and British journalists who have reported from Burma and speak of its history and the hopes and fears for its future.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 24s 888ms\nCodec             : XviD\nsource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 003 Kbps\nAspect            : 592 x 320 (1.850) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 136 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolbcmhr7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4d9c536cdb13162920b70d4d2ea73cc917a8e88","amp;dn":"PBS+Wide+Angle-+Eyes+of+the+Storm+08.19.2009.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4d9c536cdb13162920b70d4d2ea73cc917a8e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,217,197,54,205,177,49,98,146,11,112,212,210,234,115,204,145,122,142,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
