Each player \n\nreturns home to emotional reunions with friends and family, \n\nafter which they navigate the challenges of being back in their \n\nreal lives, facing the same temptations that brought them to the \n\nranch and realizing all of the things they are capable of doing \n\nnow that they couldn't do before. When they come back to the \n\nranch, they'll compete in a 5K challenge on a treadmill just as \n\nthey did in the first episode of the season, but this time, \n\nthey're going to run the 5K all by themselves. And just as \n\nbefore, each will pick who they want to train them - Bob Harper \n\nand Jillian Michaels or Cara Castronuova and Brett Hoebel-in the \n\norder in which they finish the challenge. Then a few contestants \n\nreach milestones at the weigh-in, after which another player is \n\nsent packing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74c25c345df2eba1bd75a5e9a23362fbf94f4315","amp;dn":"The.Biggest.Loser.S11E09.HDTV.XviD-LW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74c25c345df2eba1bd75a5e9a23362fbf94f4315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,194,92,52,93,242,235,161,189,117,165,233,162,51,98,251,249,79,67,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
