The duo gets more than they bargained for on their first assignment, as Zach helps Rocky confront a deadly ghost from her I.O. past.  Future issues find the agents tackling biological and chemical weapons, genetic-engineering experiments gone terribly wrong, and a host of other I.O. projects that never should have seen the light of day.\n\nCo-written by Brandon Choi and Jonathan Peterson and pencilled by Michael Ryan.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05ad7ec167e04f3288911d394134ce4ce211102","amp;dn":"The+Patriots+%28Wildstorm%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05ad7ec167e04f3288911d394134ce4ce211102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,90,215,236,22,126,4,243,40,137,17,211,148,19,76,228,206,33,17,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
