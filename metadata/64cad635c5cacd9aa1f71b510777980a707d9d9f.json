An EP of the same name had been produced by the band themselves for sale at local shows, but was re-recorded and produced by Caleb James, a renowned Australian producer. This subsequent re-release saw the band get picked up by Dew Process. The band's first single, Polka, received regular airplay on alternative radio station Triple J, and was followed by the release of their second single, Silence is Distance. Videos were shot for both of these singles, as well as for The Streetlight, which was curiously left off the label re-release of the EP.[1]\n\n&quot;Polka&quot; also performed well in 2008 Triple J Hottest 100 voting, coming in at 76 in the overall list. \n\n   1. &quot;Blasphemy&quot;\n   2. &quot;Not What I Want&quot;\n   3. &quot;19&quot;\n   4. &quot;Silence is Distance&quot;\n   5. &quot;Polka&quot;\n   6. &quot;(A Bookend)&quot;\n\n\n320Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64cad635c5cacd9aa1f71b510777980a707d9d9f","amp;dn":"Yves+Klein+Blue+-+Draw+Attention+To+Themselves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64cad635c5cacd9aa1f71b510777980a707d9d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,202,214,53,197,202,205,154,161,247,27,81,7,119,152,10,112,125,157,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
