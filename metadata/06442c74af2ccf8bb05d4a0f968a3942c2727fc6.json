Thom was moved by an interview Patch gave a couple of years ago and was inspired to write a song.\n[taken from greenplastic.com]\n\nThom wrote on Dead Air Space:\n----------\nRecently the last remaining UK veteran of the 1st world war Harry Patch died at the age of 111. I had heard a very emotional interview with him a few years ago on the Today program on Radio4. The way he talked about war had a profound effect on me. It became the inspiration for a song that we happened to record a few weeks before his death. It was done live in an abbey. The strings were arranged by Jonny. I very much hope the song does justice to his memory as the last survivor.\n\nIt would be very easy for our generation to forget the true horror of war, without the likes of Harry to remind us. I hope we do not forget. As Harry himself said\n&quot;Irrespective of the uniforms we wore, we were all victims&quot;.\n----------\n\nYou can purchase the song at:\nhttp://download.waste.uk.com/Store/did.html\n\nIt's Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1 and goes to the Royal British Legion.\n\nIt's a very moving song that doesn't sound quite like anything Radiohead has done.  The string arrangement is spectacular!  I hope you all enjoy.\n\nNote: The artwork included is a picture taken from Thom's blog post on Dead Air Space.  I darkened it and fit it to 600x600 to use as cover art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06442c74af2ccf8bb05d4a0f968a3942c2727fc6","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+Harry+Patch+%28In+Memory+of%29+%282009%29%5BMP3+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06442c74af2ccf8bb05d4a0f968a3942c2727fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,68,44,116,175,44,207,139,176,93,74,15,150,138,57,66,194,114,127,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
