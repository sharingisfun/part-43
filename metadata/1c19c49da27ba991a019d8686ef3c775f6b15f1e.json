They also use piano, guitar, mandoline, bodhran etc. You also hear nice footwork, like irish dancing. The difference is that the acadian do it sitting down on a chair, because in old days they were not allowed to dance, the church leaders said so....And not to forget two twinsisters singing beautiful in french. What makes it very special.
