And most reviews will mention the quality of Ms. Mitchell's voice, roughened by thirty years of cigarette smoking. The first thing to emphasize is that the arrangements are not for strings, but for a full orchestra. (And what's wrong with strings? Charlie Parker at the height of his powers toured with a string section.) And the use of horns, along with Mitchell's trademark use of woodwinds (which goes back as far as Ladies of the Canyon), is particularly suitable to the mood of this record. But it is the voice on Travelogue that staggers me: It's true that the range is somewhat diminished, though her voice remains a fine instrument for carrying the burdens of her songs. Among the most remarkable things about this remarkable record is how Mitchell has slowed the tempo on almost every tune; combined with her deeper--&amp; to my ear more expressive--voice, this presents the songs in a completely new way. Listen to &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard&quot; &amp; &quot;Woodstock&quot; with this in mind. The original version of &quot;Richard&quot; was a superior brush off of someone who had sold out; the new version understands that none of us escape Richard's fate. There is a mournful, elegiac quality in Mitchell's voice that I have never heard before--and I've been listening to her records for thirty years. Compare, too, the original version of &quot;Cherokee Louise&quot; with the one on Travelogue. The first emphasized childhood nostalgia &amp; anger at injustice. (There is actually a lot of anger in Mitchell's work.) The new version of &quot;Cherokee Louise&quot; is a dirge, a requiem, a profound &amp; heartfelt eulogy for a lost soul. With the full knowledge that we are all lost souls....\n\nAn apology from the uploader:\n\nI first wanted to apologize for the upload:  several years ago, my retail copy of 'Travelogue' was stolen.  Fortunately, I had made copies of the discs using the drive to drive method.  When I ripped my copies to flac for this torrent, I couldn't find any matches in freedb.  That's probably because I was using a copy of a copy--if you get my drift.  But the rip sounds great and my test and copy CRCs do match.  So while this may not be an &quot;exact audio copy&quot; by definition, you wouldn't know it when you're listening.\n\n\n\nFor more on flac:\nxs.vc/eac/index.html\nsourceforge.net\ndbpoweramp.com\nexactaudiocopy.de\n \n\nTravelogue (CD 1)\n\n01.
