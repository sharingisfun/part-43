It attempts to be as realistic as possible: much of the dialog was taken from court transcripts and other official documents, and it was even filmed in the actual 10 Rillington Place itself, of which the entire neighborhood was demolished shortly thereafter. As such, this is a historically important film that should be viewed as widely as possible, especially in countries where capital punishment is still being debated (and maybe even access to legal abortion as well...)\n \n - Yes, this just got posted a couple of days before. I ordered it just because it's one of my favorite movies and I was very surprised it wasn't already here, and well... that's my timing. Not willing to let my investment go to waste, here it is anyways. I made this one larger for increased quality.\n\n- PAL DVD source, but of course plays like any other AVI file. Behold the power of tech!\n\n - I seed using &quot;Initial Seeding&quot; which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.\n\n - PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SEED as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03fc3b90e3113b50897b409162d770c9190b7d29","amp;dn":"10+Rillington+Place+%281973%29.DVDRip.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03fc3b90e3113b50897b409162d770c9190b7d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,252,59,144,227,17,59,80,137,123,64,145,98,215,112,201,25,11,125,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
