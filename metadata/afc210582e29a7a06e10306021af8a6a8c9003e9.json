These checks on the drive are open ended so as to make replay of the answers impossible. Will pass any check on any part of the drive\n* Hardware flash modification check - The 1335 chip performs a hardware check on powerup for modified firmware. Chip fooled into thinking firmware is stock\n* Slim drive locked to read pressed game discs only - Enabled reading of DVD+R DL media for game discs\n\nAll features of current LT+ also included\n- Optimised PFI code to accomodate AP25 SS data\n- Defeats current AP25 protection\n- Protects console from logging AP25 violation \n- Full disc stealth used by default\n- Waveless booting , disc images are assumed to be correct!\n- Split-Vid used as default\n\nIf booting an AP25 title without AP25 SS game will not boot but will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12625\nIf LT+ encounters an unknown AP25 challenge, game will not boot but console will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12625\n\nAP25 SS are region specific for region locked games\n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.\nThanks also go to Team Xecuter for their generous support to this project.
