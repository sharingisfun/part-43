From the rumbling first bars of her Sci-Fi Disco stormer single 'Bad Boys', to the Red One-fashioned Dancehall groove of 'Dumb', Alexandra's A-list produced &quot;Overcome&quot; is a party monster of a record, poised to knock the socks off even the most cynical Pop enthusiast.\n\nRecorded over six months, &quot;Overcome&quot; is a collection of club smashes ('All Night,' 'Dumb,' 'Broken Heals') peppered with astonishingly soul-bearing slow jams ('Silence,' 'Perfect.') Created with the help of perhaps the industries most in demand production houses (Roc Nation and Jay-Z, The Phantom Boyz, Red One, Stargate and The Freemasons) the album is a sonic manifestation of Alexandra's ballsy personality, with the lady herself describing the collection as 'a beast'.\n\nTracks:\n\n01 Bad Boys [Ft.
