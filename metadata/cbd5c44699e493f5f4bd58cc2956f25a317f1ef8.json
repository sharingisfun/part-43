This subtle form of political analysis is effective in changing opinions and attitudes on a large scale. Homer Simpson Marches on Washington explores the transformative power that enables popular culture to influence political agendas, frame the consciousness of audiences, and create profound shifts in values and ideals.\n\nTo investigate the full spectrum of popular culture in a democratic society, editors Timothy M. Dale and Joseph J. Foy gather a top-notch team of scholars who use television shows such as Star Trek, The X-Files, All in the Family, The View, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and The Colbert Report, as well as movies and popular music, to investigate contemporary issues in American popular culture.\n\nMarch 2010\nPublisher: University Press of Kentucky\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbd5c44699e493f5f4bd58cc2956f25a317f1ef8","amp;dn":"Homer+Simpson+Marches+on+Washington%3A+Dissent+through+American+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbd5c44699e493f5f4bd58cc2956f25a317f1ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,213,196,70,153,228,147,245,244,189,88,204,41,86,242,90,49,127,30,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
