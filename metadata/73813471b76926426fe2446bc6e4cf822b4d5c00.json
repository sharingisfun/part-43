Having been imprisoned as a result of drug peddling, Mika manages to escape from a prison train and hooks up with a man who does horse-riding tricks in small-town fairgrounds. When she spies the police on her trail, she hitches a ride into Belgrade with a boy on a motorcycle. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide\n\n\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
