A major figure with a local following in Atlanta from the 1920s onward, he recorded dozens of sides throughout the '30s under a multitude of names, all the better to juggle 'exclusive' relationships with many different record labels at once, including Blind Willie, Blind Sammie, Hot Shot Willie, and Georgia Bill.\n\n\n\nIn 1949, a brief flurry of interest in old-timey country blues resulted in this 15-song session by Blind Willie McTell for the newly formed Atlantic Records. Only two songs, 'Kill It Kid' and 'Broke Down Engine Blues,' were ever issued on a failed single, and the session was forgotten until almost 20 years later. McTell is mostly solo here, vividly captured on acoustic 12-string (his sometime partner Curley Weaver may have been present on some tracks), and in excellent form. The playing and the repertory are representative of McTell as he was at this point in his career, a blues veteran rolling through his paces without skipping a beat and quietly electrifying the listener. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da8c74f9b1afb4d096b41880965744fb1d4721b3","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Blind+Willie+McTell+-+Atlanta+Twelve+String","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da8c74f9b1afb4d096b41880965744fb1d4721b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,140,116,249,177,175,180,208,150,180,24,128,150,87,68,251,29,71,33,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
