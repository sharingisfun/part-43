Less than a month later they will play their &quot;Last Waltz&quot; at Winterland. The order of songs on &quot;The Band&quot; website shows &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; as the last song in the set. I would rate the quality of this video as an A considering its age. I do not know the genealogy as it came to me on a dvd coupled with the Woodstock 94' show. I would have to guess that the lineage is: TV/VHS/DVD/ (The Band website shows this as: TV/EX/20)then I used a stand alone Sony DVD Player and extracted the video with Powerdirector &gt; Mpeg 2 &gt; then to you. Enjoy!\n\n1. Life Is a Carnival \n\n2. Stage Fright \n\n3/4? The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down \n\n4/3?
