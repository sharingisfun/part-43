After the \nprogramÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, \nfolders and registry keys that are usually left over on your computer. Even if \nyou have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller scans for an applicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s data \non your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, \nfolders and registry keys so you can delete them.\n\nForced Uninstall \nUninstall even already uninstalled programs.

With a choice of views, as well as a context menu, information on \nprogram components is available: program properties, their registry entries and \nlinks to manufacturer's web site, for a start. The &quot;Search&quot; option finds installed \napplications just by typing the first few letters of their name. Revo Uninstaller \nscans before and after an uninstallation to find all files, folders and registry \nkeys left behind by the program's uninstaller. The primary feature of Revo \nUninstaller is Hunter Mode.\n\nForced Uninstall\nRevo Uninstaller Pro has a very powerful feature called Forced Uninstall. This \nfeature allows you to remove leftovers of programs that are already uninstalled, \nincomplete installations and uninstall remnants of programs! It does not matter \nif the program, you want to remove, is not listed in Revo Uninstaller Pro or in\nWindows Add/Remove Programs Control Panel applet. Forced Uninstall gives power to \nthe user but still keeps the safety and the accuracy of the results.\n\nReal-Time Installation Monitor\nRevo Uninstaller Pro has a feature that allows monitoring of installation of a \nprogram and detects system changes during that installation. The process is done \nin real time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ simultaneously!\nThis feature is very powerful because by monitoring system changes during the \ninstallation, we eliminate all the scanning algorithms when we need to uninstall \nthat program and nevertheless we can still use these algorithms but in another \nfeature called Forced Uninstall.\n\nMulti-Level Backup System\nRevo Uninstaller Pro creates backups of removed registry keys, values, files and \nfolders. Backup Manager is the main part of that system. It helps you to manage \nbackup information stored by Revo Uninstaller Pro after deletion registry entries,\nfiles and folders. The other levels of the backup system are: \n- Creating system restore point before each uninstall\n- Full Registry backup before each uninstall\n- Full Registry backup once each day Revo Uninstaller Pro is stared\n\nHunter Mode\nThis is a special, innovative feature of Revo uninstaller which indeed  has two \nsub modes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Hunter mode and Drag and drop mode. These modes are giving you a \nflexibility to uninstall applications with one click (stop or delete) by simply \ndragging and dropping program icons to the Hunter icon or selecting their icon \nwith the mouse cursor, whether it's on the desktop, quick launch toolbar, in the \nsystem tray or the program's window is open.\n\nJunk Files Cleaner\nJunk Files Cleaner allows you to find and remove various types of junk and \nunnecessary files from your computer. Junk files are created by many of the \nWindows applications. Normally, such files are deleted by the application that \ncreated them as soon as they do not need them, but they may remain permanently \non your hard drive if there is an unexpected termination of the parent application,\na system crash, etc. Cleaning junk temporary files will free a lot of hard disk \nspace. \n\nWindows Tools\nThere are a lot of handy and useful tools and components bundled with every \nWindows operating system. Unfortunately, some have complex command line options \nand others are just plain difficult to access. The Revo Uninstaller feature \nWindows Tools gives fast, one-click access to more than ten Windows utilities \nused in daily PC management. Available tools are: System Restore, Network \nDiagnostics, Network Information, Security Center, System Properties, System \nInformation, TCP/IP Netstat Command, On-Screen Keyboard, Disk Defragmenter, \nServices, Shared Folders, Group Policy.\n\nAutorun Manager\nAuto Run Manager allows you to manage programs which load automatically at Windows \nstartup. With this tool you can not only enable or disable applications from auto \nstarting at Windows startup, but you can also get more detailed information about \nthem, e.g. the programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s publisher, description, launch path (where it is saved on\nyour computer), status of the application (if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s running or not) and more. \nStopping programs from automatically starting will increase the speed of loading \nyour Windows.\n\nBrowsers Cleaner\nYour browser records detailed record of every web site youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever visited. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \neasily accessible from your browser window and by simply pressing a button, anyone \ncan see where youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been browsing on the web! Revo Uninstaller erases web site \nhistory of web browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, Netscape and Opera. \nWith Browsers Cleaner you can also delete temporary internet files which include \nall the images youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve viewed, all the online videos youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve watched and all the \nweb pages youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve visited. Deleting temporary internet files will free up a lot of \nvaluable hard disk space on your computer.\n\nMS Office Cleaner\nMS Office Cleaner allows you to remove history of most recently used files in \nMS Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint and Front Page. If you do not want somebody \nelse to see your last opened or edited spreadsheets, documents or other files \ncreated using MS Office just select those you do not want and click Clear. \nYour most recently used files will no more be listed.\n\nWindows Cleaner\nMicrosoft Windows keeps tracks of many things that you do with your computer like \nfile search history when you search for file and folders; recently opened document \nhistory; open/save history used in standard open/save dialogs from different \napplications installed on your computer; start menu clicks history; last opened \nregistry key history and more. \n\nEvidence Remover\nDeleting your files and folders does not mean that they are gone forever.

Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security \n2- Avira AntiVir Premium \n3- avast! Pro Antivirus\n4- Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected \nby other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at June 11, 2010 - 23.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba83ce1de7ba1e2fd77cfe01125e5a256adffba","amp;dn":"Revo+Uninstaller+Pro+2.2.3+%2B+Crack+%28x86-x64%29+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba83ce1de7ba1e2fd77cfe01125e5a256adffba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,168,60,225,222,123,161,226,253,119,207,224,17,37,229,162,86,173,255,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
