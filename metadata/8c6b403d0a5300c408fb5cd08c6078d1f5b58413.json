Chaka Khan's popularity had decreased, but she was better off than some ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at least she still had a record deal. And from an A&amp;R standpoint, Warner Bros. did right by her with The Woman I Am. Although not quite in a class with What Cha' Gonna Do for Me or I Feel for You, this is a solid and commendable offering that fans of the singer shouldn't overlook. The production ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ handled by Marcus Miller, Arif Mardin and the late Wayne Braithwaite, among others ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ is high-tech, yet warm instead of mechanical. And on songs ranging from the melancholy &quot;Telephone&quot; to the introspective title song and the appealing single &quot;Love You All My Lifetime,&quot; it's clear that Khan was given strong material to work with.&quot;\n\nWikipedia:\n\n&quot;The Woman I Am is the ninth studio album by American R&amp;B/funk singer Chaka Khan, released on Warner Bros. Records in 1992. It was Khan's first studio album since 1988's C.K. and due to artistic differences between Khan and Warner Bros. Records it was also to be her final full-length release for the label.\n\nThe Woman I Am which won Khan a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female in 1993 included no less than six single releases; &quot;Love You All My Lifetime&quot; which became a number one on Billboard's Dance Singles chart as well as #2 on R&amp;B (Pop #68, UK #49), &quot;You Can Make the Story Right&quot; (US R&amp;B #8), &quot;I Want&quot; (US R&amp;B #62), &quot;Give Me All&quot;, &quot;Facts Of Love&quot; and the Diane Warren-penned ballad &quot;Don't Look At Me That Way&quot; (UK #73). Both lead single &quot;Love You All My Lifetime&quot; and &quot;Give Me All&quot; were issued in a wide variety of dance remixes by among others Frankie Knuckles. The Woman I Am became Khan's highest-charting album on the US R&amp;B Albums chart since 1984's I Feel for You, peaking at #9.\n\nThe album mainly focussed on material from the genres contemporary R&amp;B, soul and funk and was Khan's debut as executive producer in charge of production. The main producer on the album was the Grammy Award winning jazz multi-instrumentalist Marcus Miller but it also included Khan's first collaborations with Arif Mardin since 1986's Destiny; &quot;This Time&quot; and the closing track &quot;Don't Look At Me That Way&quot;, both co-produced by Mardin's son Joe Mardin. &quot;Love You All My Lifetime&quot; saw Khan teaming up with Scritti Politti's David Gamson - who incidentally also had produced the opening track on Destiny with its confusingly similar title; &quot;Love of a Lifetime&quot;. The single track &quot;I Want&quot; again featured a guest appearance by Stevie Wonder on harmonica and the suggestive ballad &quot;You Can Make The Story Right&quot; was recorded with the late bassist and producer Wayne Braithwaite, best known for his work with Will Downing and Kenny G..\n\nSince Khan's 1995 album Dare You To Love Me was shelved by the Warner Bros. Records label and instead only partly made available on greatest hits compilations and movie soundtracks it was to be six years before she released another full-length album, the Prince co-produced Come 2 My House on his label NPG Records.&quot;\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nThe Woman In Me\n===============\n01.
