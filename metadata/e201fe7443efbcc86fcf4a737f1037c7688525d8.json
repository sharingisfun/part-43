She has a lot of help from her Sparrow Quartet, which features none other than master picker Bela Fleck, as well as avant-pop cellist Ben Sollee and notable five-string fiddler Casey Driessen. It's hard to wrong with a lineup like this, especially with Washburn's many talents. She and her boys play complex and well-composed jazz-grass reminiscent of Fleck's acoustic albums (no surprise there), and she also turns out some lovely ballads, mining Alison Krauss territory, but with less schlock. Whatever the style, Abigail Washburn and the Sparrow Quartet is strong throughout.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e201fe7443efbcc86fcf4a737f1037c7688525d8","amp;dn":"Abigail+Washburn+%26+the+Sparrow+Quartet%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e201fe7443efbcc86fcf4a737f1037c7688525d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,1,254,116,67,239,188,200,111,207,74,115,127,16,55,199,104,133,37,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
