Geiger tells Winslow about his wife's schizophrenia and the death of their son. One of Shutt's former patients reveals his bigotry when he refuses to allow a black doctor to remove his gall bladder and insists that he, or another Jewish surgeon, perform the procedure. Jeffrey exhibits signs of a meltdown when he vandalizes the car of a man for taking his parking space. Aaron and Camille grieve about their impending divorce. Jeffrey's outrageous conduct in a restaurant gets him arrested mistakenly for soliciting a prostitute. Phillip incorrectly attributes Aaron's angry outburst at one patient, minutes after losing another young patient, to tensions with Camille; and threatens to fire Camille if there's a recurrence. \n\n\nMore to follow, please give back as much as you take.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bab11b0520cd6b3df96c22f1814ee721ad759ba","amp;dn":"Chicago+Hope+S01E04+-+With+The+Greatest+Of+Ease.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bab11b0520cd6b3df96c22f1814ee721ad759ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,171,17,176,82,12,214,179,223,150,194,47,24,20,238,114,26,215,89,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
