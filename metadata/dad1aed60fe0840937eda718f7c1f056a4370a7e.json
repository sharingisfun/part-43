\n     \n\n        Since the Age of Enlightenment, the gap between the known  and\n        the  unknown has  shrunk considerably.  We have  mapped every\n        corner of our  planet and explored  our universe, but  despite\n        this countless phenomena still remain unexplained.\n\n        The Unexplained is a breathtaking new series from The  History\n        Channel  that  probes the  mysteries  of the  world.  From the\n        shocking voodoo rituals of  the Caribbean to the  secret alien\n        research centre  at Area  51, from  the shadowy  doings of the\n        Skull &amp;  Bones to  terrifying vampire  myths, The  Unexplained\n        will separate fact from fiction.\n\n        Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into The Unexplained.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        For years, people have claimed that the government has covered\n        up proof of the existence  of UFOs. For years, the  government\n        has denied the rumors as groundless. Spaceships versus weather\n        balloons. Aliens versus mannequins. Both sides claim the other\n        is  lying  or  misguided;  both  sides  present   considerable\n        evidence. Examine  some of  the most  famous UFO  cases of all\n        time  in an  attempt to  get to  the bottom  of this  ongoing\n        debate. Does the secret military base in Nevada known as  Area\n        51 house the  bodies and vessel  of aliens who  crashed in the\n        desert 50  years ago?  What happened  in the  night skies over\n        Rendlesham Forest, near London? Numerous interviews provide  a\n        balanced  look  at  these and  other  famous  cases. Witnesses\n        including  highly  decorated  military  pilots  tell  of their\n        encounters with craft that they could not identify, while  the\n        world  s  most  experienced  UFO  investigators  offer  their\n        opinions of what really happened.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * Also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n        * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs.\n        * Winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n        * dont forget to tag your work\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5e18312c3d3b1e362b2d36703f37&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad1aed60fe0840937eda718f7c1f056a4370a7e","amp;dn":"The.Unexplained.UFO.vs.The.Government.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad1aed60fe0840937eda718f7c1f056a4370a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,209,174,214,15,224,132,9,55,237,167,24,247,193,240,86,164,55,10,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
