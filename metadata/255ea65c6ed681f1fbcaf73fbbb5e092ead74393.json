The album was released on 12 December  2006 in the United States by Arista Records in association with 19 Recordings Limited, nearly seven months after Hicks won the reality-talent competition in May. Hicks coined the phrase &quot;modern whomp&quot; to describe the album's soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an amalgam of soul, blues, funk, and Cajun influences with a contemporary twist. The first single from the album was the ballad &quot;Just to Feel That Way&quot;.\n\nThe album debuted at the number two spot on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 298,000 copies in its first week. Within one month of its release, Taylor Hicks was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping over one million copies. However, over a year later it had reached sales of only about 700,000 copies, making it the lowest selling debut album by an American Idol winner. The album has sold approximately 809,000 copies worldwide\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n\n[01] The Runaround\n[02] Dream Myself Awake\n[03] Heaven Knows\n[04] Gonna Move\n[05] Wherever I Lay My Hat (That's My Home)\n[06] Give Me Tonight\n[07] Just To Feel That Way\n[08] The Maze\n[09] Places I've Been\n[10] Soul Thing\n[11] The Deal\n[12] The Right Place\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:41m:06s\n\t\nTotal File Size \t\t- 107mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v8.0.2.20 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t\t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Rock\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 12 December 2006\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Arista BMG\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.taylorhicks.com/ \n\t\t\t- \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255ea65c6ed681f1fbcaf73fbbb5e092ead74393","amp;dn":"%5B2006%5D+Taylor+Hicks+-+Taylor+Hicks+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255ea65c6ed681f1fbcaf73fbbb5e092ead74393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,94,166,92,110,214,129,241,251,202,247,63,187,181,224,146,234,215,67,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
