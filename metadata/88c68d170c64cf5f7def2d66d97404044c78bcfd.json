She is the eldest daughter of the late country music singer Johnny Cash and his first wife, Vivian Liberto Cash Distin.\n\nAlthough she is often classified as a country artist, her music draws on many genres, including folk, pop, rock and blues. In the 1980s, she had a string of chart-topping singles, which crossed musical genres and landed on both C&amp;W and Top 100 charts, the most commercially successful being her 1981 breakthrough hit &quot;Seven Year Ache&quot;, which topped the U.S. country singles charts and reached the Top 30 on the U.S. pop singles charts. In 1990, Cash released Interiors, a spare, introspective album which signaled a break from her pop country past. The following year Cash ended her marriage and moved from Nashville to New York City, where she continues to write, record and perform. Since 1991 she has released four albums, written two books and edited a collection of short stories. Her fiction and essays have been published in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Oxford-American, New York Magazine, and various other periodicals and collections.\n\nShe won a Grammy in 1985 for &quot;I Don't Know Why You Don't Want Me,&quot; and has received eight other Grammy nominations. She has had 11 #1 country hit singles, 21 Top 40 country singles and two gold records.\n                                                                                                          (text from wikipedia)\n\nAll tracks composed by Rosanne Cash; except where indicated\n\n\n1.&quot;The Wheel&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:20\n2.&quot;The Way We Make a Broken Heart&quot; (John Hiatt) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:54\n3.&quot;Seven Year Ache&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:16\n4.&quot;Hold On&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:38\n5.&quot;On the Surface&quot; (Rosanne Cash, Jimmy Tittle) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 2:57\n6.&quot;No Memories Hangin' Around&quot; (Rodney Crowell) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:26\n7.&quot;My Baby Thinks He's a Train&quot; (Preston) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:14\n8.&quot;I Don't Know Why You Don't Want Me&quot; (Rosanne Cash, Rodney Crowell) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:19\n9.&quot;Blue Moon with Heartache&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:28\n10.&quot;Western Wall&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:02\n11.&quot;Tennessee Flat Top Box&quot; (Johnny Cash) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:16\n12.&quot;September When It Comes&quot; (Rosanne Cash, John Leventhal) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:41\n13.&quot;Sleeping in Paris&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 4:07\n14.&quot;Never Be You&quot; (Tom Petty, Benmont Tench) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:38\n15.&quot;What We Really Want&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 3:31\n16.&quot;Seventh Avenue&quot; (Rosanne Cash, John Leventhal) ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 5:11\n\n\nThank you for seeding  :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88c68d170c64cf5f7def2d66d97404044c78bcfd","amp;dn":"Rosanne+Cash+-+The+Very+Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88c68d170c64cf5f7def2d66d97404044c78bcfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,198,141,23,12,100,207,95,125,239,45,102,217,116,4,4,76,120,188,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
