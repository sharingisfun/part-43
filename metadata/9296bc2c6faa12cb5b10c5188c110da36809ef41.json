You start the game by choosing from a small collection of basic vehicles and machinery to explore your fairly sparce farmland which measures a mere 4 km2.\n\nPlaying in Career Mode, your aim is to whip the farm into shape, expand your fleet of farm machinery and become as successful a farmer as possible. As you progress through the game you ll need to visit the local agricultural machinery store to trade in your old vehicles and equipment for newer kit. You can choose between seven beautifully detailed tractors, four combine harvesters and over 20 tools such as a plough, seeder, baler and a self loading wagon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9296bc2c6faa12cb5b10c5188c110da36809ef41","amp;dn":"Farming+Simulator+%5BEnglish%5D%5BPC%5Dgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9296bc2c6faa12cb5b10c5188c110da36809ef41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,150,188,44,111,170,18,203,91,16,197,24,140,17,13,163,104,9,239,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
