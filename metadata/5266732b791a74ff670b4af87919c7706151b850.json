This is wild stuff, so check it out if you've never heard this sort of music before. The analog rig used to extract the sound from the grooves is near state-of-the-art, producing almost none of the tracking distortion or surface noise normally associated with LPs.\n\nAGP1-157 are available for direct download in the archive at the AGP mirror site:\n\nAGP163-168 will hopefully be available soon at a location to be named later.\n\nAGP169-170 are available at http://thepiratebay.se/user/human2011\n\n=======================================\n\nAGP171 is the second of two devoted to the music of the Croatian composer Ivo Malec, who was one of the founding members of the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM) in Paris. This and AGP170 comprise a transcription of a long out-of-print 2LP set on INA-GRM records (9105 MA): \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Ivo-Malec-Sigma/release/320882&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Ivo-Malec-Sigma/release/320882&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe works on these LPs were composed between 1963 and 1981, and range from orchestra to vocal to computer. They make up a nice cross-section of this remarkable composer's work. The installment includes a PDF with scans of the LP inner covers and the accompanying eight-page booklet with extensive notes and commentary in French. Other works by Ivo Malec were included in AGP148. If you like these tracks, many more works by GRM composers can be found at electrocd.com or at ina.fr.
