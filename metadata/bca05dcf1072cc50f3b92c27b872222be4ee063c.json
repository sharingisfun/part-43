It is the perfect tool for making images for web pages, newspapers and magazines or simply for your own creations. Extracted objects are saved as a TIFF file with transparency. Decompose also corrects colors to remove all traces of the previous background, thus generating perfect mattes.\n\n\n\nThe best way to find out if Decompose suits your needs is to download the latest version and try the demonstration mode. Also, make sure you read the Decompose tutorial to learn about all the amazing features.\n\nThe Decompose advantage\n\nTraditional extraction of objects with a lasso tool typically takes time and the results are far from perfect. The extracted objects have rough edges that are often tinted with the color of the previous background. Decompose produces smooth edges and completely removes the background color.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.6 or higher\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bca05dcf1072cc50f3b92c27b872222be4ee063c","amp;dn":"Decompose+1.2+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bca05dcf1072cc50f3b92c27b872222be4ee063c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,160,93,207,16,114,204,80,243,185,44,39,184,114,34,43,228,238,6,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
