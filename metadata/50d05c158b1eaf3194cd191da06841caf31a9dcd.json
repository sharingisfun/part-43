However, he soon finds out how real that dream was when a giant serpentine monster attacks him and his sister. Tsumura Tokiko, the girl from his dream, explains that the monster is a homunculus. Kazuki had been attacked and killed by it when rescuing Tokiko, however the girl revived him by placing a kakugane medal in his chest.\n\nThe kakugane, Tokiko explains, is an alchemical device that when activated can give him the power to fight the homunculus monster. Using this, Kazuki creates his own buso renkin, an alchemic weapon in the form of a huge lance. Along with Tokiko and her own buso renkin, Kazuki joins the fight against the homunculus and their master.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are not able to open files or want to watch in better quality.\nUse KMPlayer     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4595030/The_KMPlayer_2.9.4.1434&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4595030/The_KMPlayer_2.9.4.1434&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nand use CCCP codec pack    &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3664665/CCCP_(Combined_Community_Codec_Pack)_2007.02.22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3664665/CCCP_(Combined_Community_Codec_Pack)_2007.02.22&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFor blu-rays and high quality videos     &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4403094/CoreAVC_H.264_Video_Codec_Professional_v1.8.0.0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4403094/CoreAVC_H.264_Video_Codec_Professional_v1.8.0.0&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you have any anime request, you can make it.
