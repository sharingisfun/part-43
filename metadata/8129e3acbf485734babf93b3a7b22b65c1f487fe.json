Humans are not his target. It is the other monsters who walk this world-the wendigo, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, and vampires-who live in fear of his enormous and terrifying powers. And what those powers are setting into motion is a horror beyond your deepest, darkest nightmares.\n\nWritten and illustrated by Kelley Jones (Batman).\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8129e3acbf485734babf93b3a7b22b65c1f487fe","amp;dn":"The+13th+Son+%28Dark+Horse%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8129e3acbf485734babf93b3a7b22b65c1f487fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,41,227,172,191,72,87,52,186,191,147,179,167,178,43,101,193,244,135,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
