He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n--Wikipedia\n\n  In Aground, a yacht, the Dragoon, is stolen, and its owner, Rae Osborne, hires sailor John Ingram to help her get it back. Finding the yacht beached on a sandbar near the Bahamas, they board it only to be attacked by the thugs, Morrison and Ruiz, who stole it. The thugs force Ingram to try to get it under sail again so that they can deliver their cargo of guns and munitions to revolutionaries in Latin America. \n  While scheming to get free of their captors, Ingram and Osborne fall in love, and in Dead Calm, one Williams' later novels, they sail the Pacific on their honeymoon cruise.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d1d5b3421a13d6b3f18acc2573d511f61f5b283","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+Aground+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d1d5b3421a13d6b3f18acc2573d511f61f5b283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,29,91,52,33,161,61,107,63,24,172,194,87,61,81,31,97,245,178,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
