The plot then follows the life of a simple farmboy, Luke Skywalker, as he and his newly met allies (Han Solo, Chewbacca, Ben Kenobi, C-3PO, R2-D2) attempt to rescue a rebel leader, Princess Leia, from the clutches of the Empire. The conclusion is culminated as the Rebels, including Skywalker and flying ace Wedge Antilles make an attack on the Empires most powerful and ominous weapon, the Death Star.\n\nPlease seed after downloading...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74049aed4a1bc7a44d23a260a450ddc68ccb7e9a","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+%281977%29+DVDrip.+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74049aed4a1bc7a44d23a260a450ddc68ccb7e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,4,154,237,74,27,199,164,77,35,162,96,164,80,221,198,140,203,126,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
