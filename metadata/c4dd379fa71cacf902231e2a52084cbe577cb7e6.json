Maurice Jarre's famous theme is now synomous with anything dry and deserty. David Lean spent several years in Jordan and Morocco making the film and is said to have spent days waiting for the &quot;right&quot; sunrise. However his perfectionism paid off and the shots are fantastic with wonderful pieces of editing.\n\nHowever Lawrence of Arabia is not just a sandy visual feast. The performances are also superb. Claude Rains is suitably suave as the diplomat and Jack Hawkins appropriately brusque as General Allenby. Alec Guiness is almost unrecognisible in his amazing turn as Prince Feisal. However it is the performances of the two young leads (Omar Sharif as Ali and Peter O'Toole as Lawrence himself) which deserve the most credit. Neither actor had starred in an international film before Lawrence of Arabia but they proved themselves worthy of their casting and, of course, went on to have very successful careers.\n\nThrough their subtle performances, O'Toole and Sharif make one of the most interesting aspects of the film the interaction of the two main characters. When Lawrence first meets Ali, the latter guns down a fellow Arab for drinking at a well belonging to Ali. Lawrence accuses Ali of being &quot;silly, barbarous and cruel&quot; and yet ultimately as the plot unfolds it is shown that it is Ali who is the more humane and rational of the two for, as his career takes off, Lawrence becomes caught up in his own glory that increasingly brings out his sadism and near insanity. Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies Lean's amazing eye for beautiful shots and brilliant editing, but is also a sensitive study of an enigmatic and tragic figure.\n\n&quot;A truly majestic piece of cinema *****&quot; - Empire \n\nMedia Info, (Sample Disc 1),:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Lawrence of Arabia (1962)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Disc 1.AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.78 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 829 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nBit rate                         : 1 496 Kbps\nWidth                            : 706 pixels\nHeight                           : 376 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.225\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.235\nStream size                      : 1.46 GiB (82%)\nWriting library                  : XviD \n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 19mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 319 MiB (17%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 407 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5958\n3/4/2011 8:24:23 PM\nmbam-log-2011-03-04 (20-24-23).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 10 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
