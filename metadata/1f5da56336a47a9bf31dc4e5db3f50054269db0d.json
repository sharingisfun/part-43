These concepts underlie the musical skills of listening, performance, and composition. Like humans, computer music programs can benefit from a systematic foundation of musical knowledge. This book explores the technology of implementing musical processes such as segmentation, pattern processing, and interactive improvisation in computer programs. It shows how the resulting applications can be used to accomplish tasks ranging from the solution of simple musical problems to the live performance of interactive compositions and the design of musically responsive installations and Web sites.\n\nMachine Musicianship is both a programming tutorial and an exploration of the foundational concepts of musical analysis, performance, and composition. The theoretical foundations are derived from the fields of music theory, computer music, music cognition, and artificial intelligence. The book will be of interest to practitioners of those fields, as well as to performers and composers.\n\nThe concepts are programmed using C++ and Max. The accompanying CD-ROM includes working versions of the examples, as well as source code and a hypertext document showing how the code leads to the program's musical functionality.\n\nRobert Rowe is Associate Professor of Music at New York University. \n\n\tAcknowledgments\tix\n1\tMachine Musicianship\n2\tSymbolic Processes\t17\n3\tSub-symbolic Processes\t93\n4\tSegments and Patterns\t145\n5\tCompositional Techniques\t201\n6\tAlgorithmic Expression and Music Cognition\t235\n7\tInteractive Improvisation\t277\n8\tInteractive Multimedia\t317\n9\tInstallations\t355\n10\tDirections\t377\n\tReferences\t381\n\tIndex \n\n======&gt; Technical data &lt;======\n\nTitle: Machine Musicianship\nAuthor: Robert Rowe\nEditore: MIT Press\nYears: 2001\nLanguage: inglese\nFormato file: pdf\nGrandezza del file: 99,1 MB\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f5da56336a47a9bf31dc4e5db3f50054269db0d","amp;dn":"Machine+Musicianship+%282001%29+MIT+Press.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f5da56336a47a9bf31dc4e5db3f50054269db0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,93,165,99,54,164,122,155,243,29,196,229,219,63,80,5,66,105,219,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
