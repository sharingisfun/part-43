As the Swell Season, the two have played sold-out shows all over the world. Despite all their successes, Hansard admits that he and Irglova are recognized on the street more but make sure to be true to themselves. &quot;When you're shocked to your core with the success of an award like that, I think you have to really look into yourself and look into your roots and look at how grounded you are,&quot; Hansard tells Spinner. &quot;And don't resist [success]. Just go with it.&quot;\n\nAnd now the Swell Season is back with 'Strict Joy' -- a new collection of crooning ballads and heart-melting love songs. &quot;For me, it's just an audio diary,&quot; Hansard admits. &quot;It's just another installment of the life we lead.&quot;\n\nHansard reveals 'In These Arms' -- today's featured track -- stemmed from a small idea that just walked into the studio one day and grew into love song about trust and faith in another person. &quot;Sometimes you're just meant to commit to someone's life, and you're meant to go through all these experiences,&quot; Hansard says. &quot;But it's all good because it's all part of something that's already been written.&quot;\n\n'Strict Joy' releases on October 27.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:288449dfbec35200314cf06a362fa635d4efd8a8","amp;dn":"The+Swell+Season+-+In+These+Arms+-+MP3+-+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"288449dfbec35200314cf06a362fa635d4efd8a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,132,73,223,190,195,82,0,49,76,240,106,54,47,166,53,212,239,216,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
