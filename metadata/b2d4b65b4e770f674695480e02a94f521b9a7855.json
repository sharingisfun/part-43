Musically, they include James Otto's country effort &quot;Sunset Man&quot; and Craig David's R&amp;B tune &quot;Friday Night.&quot; But for the most part, this is a miscellany of mediocre pop music of the early 21st century, presumably the kind of thing one or more of the four late-teen principals in the picture might be expected to have on her iPod. The selection and sequencing seem to owe something to the compilers of the Now That's What I Call Music! series, as the musical styles switch from pop to country to R&amp;B to punk pop and back to pop/rock. But none of this is memorable, and some of it doesn't make sense. Why is Eric Hutchinson's leadoff song called &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot; when it's set to a simplified ska beat? While the album isn't quite dismissible as a Warner Bros. Records label sampler designed more to do favors to friends than to assemble music of any quality, it's a close call. ~ William Ruhlmann, All Music Guide\n\nTrack listing (artistdirect.com):\n\n1Rock &amp; RollHutchinson, Eric4:03\n\n2TogetherBranch, Michelle4:07\n\n3Sunset ManOtto, James3:31\n\n4No One's AwareSavoretti, Jack3:28\n\n5Warm WhispersHiggins, Missy3:15\n\n6Friday NightDavid, Craig3:34\n\n7Sister Rosetta (Capture the Spirit)Noisettes [2]3:00\n\n85 Times out of 100Hot Hot Heat3:02\n\n9Girls Just Want to Have FunLauper, Cyndi3:56\n\n10You Are MineMute Math4:46\n\n11Strange &amp; Beautiful (I'll Put a Spell on You)Aqualung3:49\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d4b65b4e770f674695480e02a94f521b9a7855","amp;dn":"The+Sisterhood+of+the+Traveling+Pants+2+%282008%29+OST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d4b65b4e770f674695480e02a94f521b9a7855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,212,182,91,78,119,15,103,70,149,72,14,2,169,79,82,27,154,120,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
