Cinematographer Bruce Seven deserves a lot of credit for adding some punch to sex scenes that could not stand on their own. Most scenes are so joyless, jaded and programmed, they look like what you might find if you put a hidden camera on the scene of a gathering of Young Republicans on drugs. There's no worthwhile action until almost an hour into the film when a solid three-way scene takes place between a photographer of dildo ads and two of his randy female models. This scene has a lot of sex that seems spontaneous and fun.\nBare Elegance studies the exploits of a young starlet who wants to come on to a film director who wants no parts of her. You see, he has kinky desires of his own and they don't synch with hers. The main thing hurting this film is that it doesn't really know where it wants to go. It starts off feeling like a mid-priced &quot;made for cable&quot; quickie, but stumbles over its own budgetary limitations. Add to this a lot of talk and a lead actress that thinks she's Teri Garr whenever she gets to open her mouth for words, and you wonder where all the kinky action promised on the back of the box went. Well, just after you decide to keep watching this just until Love Boat comes on, the film bops into its last half hour and along comes scenes with everybody's favorite alphabet soup, S &amp; M and B &amp; D. There's some creativity shown here but not enough to make me take notes and use it at the staff New Year's party.\n\n\nVideo: 576x432 (1.33:1), 25 fps, XviD MPEG-4 ~1529 kbps avg, 0.25 bit/pixel\nAudio: 44.100 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~128.00 kbps avg\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAlimAAcN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAlimAAcN&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6b839d17a07c2a1b1d1ae9eb579392bd00992d","amp;dn":"Bare+Elegance+%281984%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6b839d17a07c2a1b1d1ae9eb579392bd00992d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,107,131,157,23,160,124,42,27,29,26,233,235,87,147,146,189,0,153,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
