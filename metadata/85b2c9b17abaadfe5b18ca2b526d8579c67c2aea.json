Caldera Systems OpenLinux 1.3 uses a standard 2.0.35\nLinux kernel. It also includes other unique features, making OpenLinux\nthe most reliable and easy-to-use Linux available.\n\nCaldera has taken important steps toward cleaning up this rogue OS for \nthe buttoned-down crowd.\n\nCaldera has managed to make the installation process tolerable for the \nrelative Linux neophyte, but again, we wouldn't call it easy. \n\nThe installation utility isn't as pretty or as intuitive as the one \nprovided by Red Hat Software, but it gets the job done as long as you've \nchecked your hardware in advance.\n\nFor the client, the CD contains the graphical user interface system \nX-Window, K Desktop Environment, Netscape Communicator 4.06, and the \nproductivity suite StarOffice. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b2c9b17abaadfe5b18ca2b526d8579c67c2aea","amp;dn":"CALDERA+SYSTEMS+OPENLINUX+1.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b2c9b17abaadfe5b18ca2b526d8579c67c2aea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,178,201,177,122,186,173,254,91,24,202,43,82,109,133,121,198,124,42,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
