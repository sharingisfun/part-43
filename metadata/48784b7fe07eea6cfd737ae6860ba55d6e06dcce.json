Whether fictionalizing his dramatic exploits as a Royal Air \nForce pilot during World War II or concocting the ingeniously plotted \nfables that were dramatized on television as Tales of the Unexpected, \nDahl was brilliant at provoking in his readers the overwhelming desire \nto know what happens nextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and at satisfying that desire in ways that \nfeel both surprising and inevitable.\n\nFilled with devilish plot twists, his tales display a tantalizing blend \nof macabre humor and the absurdly grotesque. From ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Landlady,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ about \nan unusual boardinghouse that features a small but very permanent clientele, \nto ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPig,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a brutally funny look at vegetarianism, to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMan from the South,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nin which a fanatical gambler does his betting with hammer, nails, and \na butcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knife, DahlÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creations amuse and shock us in equal measure, \ngleefully reminding us of what might lurk beneath the surface of the \nordinary. \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIntroduction by Jeremy Treglown\nSelect Bibliography\nChronology\n\n1.\tAn African Story\n2.\tOnly This\n3.\tKatina\n4.\tBeware of the Dog\n5.\tThey Shall Not Grow Old\n6.\tSomeone Like You\n7.\tDeath of an Old Old Man\n8.\tMadame Rosette\n9.\tA Piece of Cake\n10.\tYesterday Was Beautiful\n11.\tNunc Dimittis\n12.\tSkin\n13.\tMan from the South\n14.\tThe Soldier\n15.\tThe Sound Machine\n16.\tMr Botibol\n17.\tVengeance Is Mine Inc.\n18.\tThe Wish\n19.\tPoison\n20.\tTaste\n21.\tDip in the Pond\n22.\tThe Great Automatic Grammatizator\n23.\tClaudÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dog:\n24.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Ratcatcher\n25.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Rummins\n26.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mr Hoddy\n27.\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mr Feasey\n28.\tMy Lady Love, My Dove\n29.\tNeck\n30.\tLamb to Slaughter\n31.\tGallopin Foxley\n32.\tEdward the Conqueror\n33.\tThe Way Up to Heaven\n34.\tWilliam and Mary\n35.\tParsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Pleasure\n36.\tGeorgy Porgy\n37.\tMrs Bixby and the ColonelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Coat\n38.\tRoyal Jelly\n39.\tThe Champion of the World\n40.\tGenesis and Catastrophe\n41.\tPig\n42.\tThe Landlady\n43.\tThe Visitor\n44.\tThe Last Act\n45.\tThe Great Switcheroo\n46.\tThe Butler\n47.\tBitch\n48.\tAh, Sweet Mystery of Life\n49.\tThe Hitchhiker\n50.\tThe Umbrella Man\n51.\tThe Bookseller\n52.\tThe Surgeon\n\nAppendix: Dates of Composition and First Publication.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember if everyone seeds 1 : 1 then this torrent will never die!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48784b7fe07eea6cfd737ae6860ba55d6e06dcce","amp;dn":"The+Collected+Stories+of+Roald+Dahl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48784b7fe07eea6cfd737ae6860ba55d6e06dcce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,120,75,127,224,126,234,108,253,115,122,230,134,11,165,93,110,6,220,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
