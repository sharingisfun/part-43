This begins with saving the remains of the unit, abandoned by its headquarters after being ambushed during a mission in Angola. You must finish the mission and get your handful of survivors out of the country to start rebuilding the unit, find out what happened and eventually take revenge on those that abandoned your men. Manage a mercenary company, from supplies to recruitment, and rebuild your unit into a force worthy of respect. Nine different campaigns with up to ten objectives are featured.\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To CD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255516326b001aa32081fa2c250cf85b4978dbe9","amp;dn":"Shadow.Company.Left.For.Dead.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255516326b001aa32081fa2c250cf85b4978dbe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,85,22,50,107,0,26,163,32,129,250,44,37,12,248,91,73,120,219,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
