Technically, the film's merits include an evocative score, the subtle use of visual clues, and unmelodramatic acting. But perhaps the strongest aspect of the movie is the way it allows the viewer to see events from different perspectives, and thereby not only drives the evolution of the story, but also gives it a truly three-dimensional quality. The film begins with a segment which, nearing its end, savagely reverses the audience's expectations and sympathies; and thereafter, the story is told in achronological, overlapping fragments, each one offering a different perspective on events. And because of its technical merits, the film's use of this device never damages the naturalistic mood. As events reach their conclusion, you find yourself really caring about the characters, even the ostensibly unattractive ones. 'The Night of the Sunflowers' is a fine film, that never tries to pretend to be more than it is, but which offers rewards through the care with which it portrays its world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456111&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456111&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\nGeneral:\n\nComplete name                    : The Night of the Sunflowers.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.81 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 187 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate                         : 1 730 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 396 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.248\nStream size                      : 1.43 GiB (79%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 58mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 379 MiB (20%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee6a8809688614ba910f44be24a1d4a3bd4b014","amp;dn":"The+Night+of+the+Sunflowers+2006+DVD9rip+Spanish%2FEnglish+Klam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee6a8809688614ba910f44be24a1d4a3bd4b014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,230,168,128,150,136,97,75,169,16,244,75,226,74,29,74,59,212,176,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
