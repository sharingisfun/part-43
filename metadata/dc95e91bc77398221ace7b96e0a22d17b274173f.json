Julian 4:26 \n\nSinger-songwriter Kevin Brown hails from rural Eastern Washington, where the arid Columbia Basin Plateau meets the Ponderosa Pine forests of the Selkirk Mountains. His songs explore the lives and thoughts of the folks that live in this region, people who enjoy being close to the earth and living close to home. And like the rough and raw landscape, BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs have many layers underneath. For a songwriter coming into a solo career in his late 40s, BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut album is surprisingly self-assured.\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/03/27/kevin-brown/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc95e91bc77398221ace7b96e0a22d17b274173f","amp;dn":"Kevin+Brown...The+County+Primaries%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc95e91bc77398221ace7b96e0a22d17b274173f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,149,233,27,199,115,152,34,26,206,123,150,224,162,45,23,178,116,23,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
