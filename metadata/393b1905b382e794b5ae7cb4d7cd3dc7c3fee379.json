Unfortunately only one (Ballad Zulu: a trained solicitor) out of the twelve artistes is alive and well. The rest have either passed (individuals) or disbanded (as a band). I have uploaded this as another sample of the cream of Zambian Music.\n\nThis volume covers music from the 70's to the early 90's. Enjoy and remember to seed. You can obtain full copies of these albums from retail outlets.\n\n\nThe mark of the Tooth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393b1905b382e794b5ae7cb4d7cd3dc7c3fee379","amp;dn":"Sounds+of+Zambia+-+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393b1905b382e794b5ae7cb4d7cd3dc7c3fee379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,59,25,5,179,130,231,148,181,174,124,180,215,205,61,199,195,254,227,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
