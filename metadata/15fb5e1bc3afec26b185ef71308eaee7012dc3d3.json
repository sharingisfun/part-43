It's got everything: Biblical, Special effects, Drama, Hope.. Great flick for anyone..\n\nIt's a ISO-image, which means it's just click on the finished download, and it'll mount and burn in what ever program you've got assigned for this. All you need is a DVDburner and a Blanc DVDR.. :-)\n\n&quot;Set in 90 AD, this film gives us insight into the lives of Christians who lived under the domination of Roman rule. Emperor Domitian is in power (played with ample dementia by Bruce Payne), and his goal is to kill every living Christian who does not denounce God and give allegiance to Domitian alone, who has claimed himself god over all things.\nThe imagery in this film is fantastic; Giovanni Galasso's cinematography is full of rich color, and a feast for the eyes; there are portions that are like liquid works of art, and I never tire of watching them, in fact, several viewings are needed to fully appreciate the creative magic of the photography. The brilliance of the palette reminds me of the heyday of Technicolor, with its opulent reds, greens and blues.\n\nThe great Richard Harris is the apostle John, and it is one of his last appearances on film. Harris, who was so terrific starring in the cable television Bible Series production of &quot;Abraham&quot; [Great movie. Think I'll upload it later.. V.]in 1994, has less to do in this film, but with his weathered face and fabulous voice is wonderful. The attractive cast that surrounds him is excellent, with Vittoria Belvedere, Benjamin Sadler and Ian Duncan in the leads. Christian Kohlund is also impressive as Quintus Maximus.\n\nThe lavish sets and authentic looking costumes lend credibility to a film that is largely about John's visions, and are a good contrast to the &quot;New heaven and new earth&quot; of the beautiful, light-filled revelations given to the apostle.\n\nKudos to director Raffaele Mertes who directs with the eye of an artist (he was cinematographer for seven of the other Bible Series productions and director for &quot;Esther&quot;), and another great talent from the same series of films is the award-winning composer Monsignor Marco Frisina, who for this production was also Biblical Consultant, as well as giving us an atmospheric, lovely soundtrack.\nTotal running time is 96 minutes, for this marvelous telling of the apostle John's final days on the island of Patmos.&quot;\n\n\nLove from Verifire.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95e3f0e7fcf3fce7f0f8f4fcf9d5f2f8f4fcf9bbf6faf8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15fb5e1bc3afec26b185ef71308eaee7012dc3d3","amp;dn":"The+Apocalypse+%5BNordic+%2B+English+Subs%5D%5B2002%5D%5BISO%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15fb5e1bc3afec26b185ef71308eaee7012dc3d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,251,94,27,195,175,236,38,177,133,239,113,48,142,174,231,1,45,195,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
