And who better to navigate these hypothetical versions of the &quot;multiverse&quot; than Brian Greene? Normally an unflinching apologist for string theory, the bestselling author of The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos here treats all viable alternate realities to a laudably fair shake. For a book exploring the most far-reaching implications of bleeding-edge mathematics, The Hidden Reality is surprisingly light on math, written as it is &quot;for a broad audience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ its only prerequisite the will to persevere.&quot; Such perseverance pays off with a motley cast of potential universes featuring doppelgÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ngers, strings, branes, quantum probabilities, holographs, and simulated worlds. The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated.
