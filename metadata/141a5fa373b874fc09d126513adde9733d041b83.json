Immediately occurrences begin he cannot explain. And beyond the occurrences there is something about the house which gnaws at Becket - some strange connection he senses he has with the house's past. Soon, the haunting turns personal, he hears voices suggesting clues to a deep mystery. He questions his sanity, seeks medical help, but instead finds assistance in a young psychic who immediately declares, &quot;There's a very bad secret in this house.&quot; Together they embark on a terrifying journey to uncover the secret - a journey which leads them deep into the recesses of The Skeptic's own troubled mind\n\n\nRelease Date: 2011.02.08\n\n\nThe.Haunting.Of.Bryan.Becket.2009.720p.BluRay.x264-aAF -Thanks\n\n\nGreetz to Imagine ,Flawl3ss ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom,BDK,DiGiTALiNK,LEGION,Classified,iLLUSiON ,THC,WBZ,Rx,iLLUSiON","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:141a5fa373b874fc09d126513adde9733d041b83","amp;dn":"The+Haunting+Of+Bryan+Becket+2009+SAFCuk009+%7BDragonTrG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"141a5fa373b874fc09d126513adde9733d041b83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,26,95,163,115,184,116,252,9,209,38,81,58,221,233,115,61,4,27,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
