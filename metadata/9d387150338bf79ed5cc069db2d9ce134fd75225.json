It originated during the late 1980s and early 1990s in the Indian state of Goa. Essentially, Trance music was pop culture's answer to the Goa Trance music scene on the beaches of Goa where the traveller's music scene has been famous since the time of the Beatles. Goa Trance enjoyed the greater part of its success from around 1994ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1998, and since then has dwindled significantly both in production and consumption, being replaced by its successor, Psychedelic Trance (aka psytrance). Many of the original Goa Trance artists: Simon Posford, Slinky Wizard, and Total Eclipse are still making music, but refer to their style of music simply as &quot;PSY&quot;. TIP Records, Flying Rhino Records, Dragonfly Records, Transient Records, Phantasm Records, Symbiosis Records, Blue Room Released were all key players on the beach and in the scene.\n\nGoa Trance is closely related to the emergence of Psytrance during the latter half of the 1990s and early 2000s, where the two genres mixed together. In popular culture, the distinction between the two genres often remains largely a matter of opinion (they are considered by some to be synonymous; others say that Psytrance is more &quot;psychedelic/cybernetic&quot; and that Goa Trance is more &quot;organic&quot;, and still others maintain that there is a clear difference between the two). If anything, the styles are easier to differentiate in Central and Eastern Europe (e.g. Austria, Hungary, Romania) where Goa Trance parties are more popular than Psy-Trance parties - the opposite being true in the UK, Belgium and Germany. Psy Trance has a noticeably more aggressive bassline and goa tends to avoid the triplet-style bass lines. Between them however, both psy- and goa trance are sonically distinct from other forms of trance in both tonal quality, structure and feel. In many countries they are generally more underground and less commercial than other forms of trance, except for Brazil and Israel, which since the year of 2000 it became both countries most popular type of music for the general party scene. Top DJ's from the UK and other parts of Western Europe regularly fly to Goa for special parties, often on the beaches or in rice paddies. &quot;Shorebar&quot; in Anjuna Beach is traditionally seen as the birthplace and center of the Goan trance scene.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist - VA\n\nGenre - Psychedelic\n\nType - Compilation\n\nRelease Date - Jan-29-2011\n\nTracks - cd1: 9  | cd2: 9\n\nLength - cd1: 76:25 | cd2: 73:01\n\nSize - 213,4 MB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD1\n\n\n\n 01  Egorythmia - Beyond Gravity        07:37\n\n 02  Loopstep - Step In Dive            07:25\n\n 03  Invisible Reality - Invisible      09:12\n\n     Reality (Sunstryk Remix)\n\n 04  Klopfgeister - Ashpipe            09:24\n\n 05  Ritmo - Declare                    08:23\n\n 06  Terahert &amp; Sideform - Spiritual    06:49\n\n     Community\n\n 07  Ace Ventura - Connected            10:15\n\n 08  Progenitor - Typical Human        07:43\n\n     Behaviour (Hi-Profile Remix)\n\n 09  Solano - Qvist                    09:37\n\n\n\n     CD2\n\n\n\n 01  Sunstryk - See Natures Kindness    10:14\n\n 02  Hi-Profile - Don't Forget Me      08:27\n\n 03  E-Clip - Indian Spirit            07:28\n\n 04  Terahert - Wake Up                07:02\n\n 05  Plastic Vibe - Drops              08:54\n\n 06  Mad Actors - Oje De Aqua          07:52\n\n 07  DNA - Signal 5                    07:08\n\n 08  Noises With Amplitudes - Disco    08:53\n\n     Queen\n\n 09  Phanatic - Guarana Remix          07:03\n\n\nSEED and SHAre!!\n\nClick on my username for more!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d387150338bf79ed5cc069db2d9ce134fd75225","amp;dn":"VA_-_Goa+2011+Vol.1-2CD+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d387150338bf79ed5cc069db2d9ce134fd75225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,56,113,80,51,139,247,158,213,204,6,157,178,217,206,19,79,215,82,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
