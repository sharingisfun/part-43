It is the ninth film in the Star Trek franchise, and the third to feature the cast from the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation. It revolves around the insurrection of the USS Enterprise-E as they discover that Starfleet has been conspiring with a species known as the Son'a to steal the planet of the peaceful Ba'ku for themselves.\n\n\nJerry Goldsmith originally intended to become a concert hall composer, but soon realized that the infrequency of concert hall commissions would never satisfy his hunger to write music (much less pay the bills). He began studying piano at the age of six, and was studying composition at age fourteen. He became acquainted with the legendary composer MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³zsa, and attended his classes in film composition at the University of Southern California.\n\n\n\nIn 1950, he was employed as a clerk typist in the music department at CBS. It was there that he was given his first assignments as a composer for radio shows, such as Romance and CBS Radio Workshop. He would stay with CBS until 1960, having already scored some episodes of The Twilight Zone. He was hired by Revue Studios to score their Thriller series, which lead to further television commissions. He composed his first film score for the 1957 western Black Patch, which featured TOS guest actors Stanley Adams and Peter Brocco.\n\n\n\nIn 1962, Goldsmith was awarded his first Oscar nomination for his acclaimed score to the poorly-received John Huston picture Freud. At the same time, he became acquainted with influential film composer Alfred Newman, who, recognizing Goldsmith's talents, influenced Universal into hiring him to score the film Lonely Are The Brave in 1963. From then on, Goldsmith established himself as a leading name in American film music.\n\n\n\nJerry Goldsmith died of cancer on 21 July 2004 in Beverly Hills, California. He was 75 years old.\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST\n\n\n\nStar Trek: Insurrection 1998\n\nby Jerry Goldsmith\n\n\n\n01 Ba'Ku Village\n\n02 In Custody\n\n03 Childrens' Story\n\n04 Not Functioning\n\n05 New Sight\n\n06 The Drones Attack\n\n07 The Riker Maneuver\n\n08 The Same Race\n\n09 No Threat  \n\n10 The Healing Process\n\n11 End Credits   9.79 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3bd050edb752f12e60d87ab18529bd02797427a","amp;dn":"Star+Trek+9-Insurrection+%28OST%29-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3bd050edb752f12e60d87ab18529bd02797427a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,189,5,14,219,117,47,18,230,13,135,171,24,82,155,208,39,151,66,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
