It is her fourth album released after going solo.\nAfter fifteen successful years in the music industry and numerous hit singles, Estefan released a Greatest hits album that includes many of her successful singles from throughout the first part of her career. To date, the album has sold 5.5 million copies.\n\nMost of the singles released prior to 1992, both as a solo artist and along with her previous band, the Miami Sound Machine, are included on this compilation. However, fans were disappointed in the albums lack of ALL of Gloria and the Miami Sound Machine's hits. The US version ignores &quot;Dr. Beat&quot;, &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, &quot;Cuts Both Ways&quot; and &quot;Live For Loving You.&quot; The international versions included &quot;Dr. Beat&quot; and &quot;Bad Boy&quot; in the compilation. \n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Dr. Beat\n[02] Conga\n[03] Words Get In The Way\n[04] Can't Stay Away From You\n[05] Bad Boy\n[06] 1-2-3 (Remix)\n[07] Anything For You\n[08] Here We Are\n[09] Rhythm Is Gonna Get You\n[10] Get On Your Feet\n[11] Don't Wanna Lose You\n[12] Coming Out Of The Dark\n[13] Christmas Through Your Eyes\n[14] I See Your Smile\n[15] Go Away\n[16] Always Tomorrow\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 01h:06m:48s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 163mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Dance\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 03 November 1992\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Epic Sony Music\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.gloriaestefan.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/gloriaestefan\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41667539c0c48841dff5cbbb919294b93a5a3c37","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Gloria+Estefan+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41667539c0c48841dff5cbbb919294b93a5a3c37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,102,117,57,192,196,136,65,223,245,203,187,145,146,148,185,58,90,60,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
