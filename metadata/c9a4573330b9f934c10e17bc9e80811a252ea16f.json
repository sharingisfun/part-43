This project started out as a gift. It also turned into a nightmare, as a poster promised it would on the other Sinatra torrent. Most of Sinatra's torrents are not broken up into albums and are poorly (if at all) tagged. I started the project using the flac torrent someone uploaded of Reprise Complete Recordings. I had to convert it into a wave and then break it up into songs using the program Audacity and tag the songs. That proved to be too time consuming. So I downloaded the other torrent of his songs and had to tag them. I used the program MP3 Tag v2.43. \n\nThese files are at 192 kps. Those are the ones I converted from the flac files. the others are 320 kps. Why someone would make 320 kps from recordings from the 1960's is beyond me and a waste of space.\n\nThe other problem I ran into is multiple versions of the same song recorded at different stages of his career. I tried my best to do that right but I am sure a few wrong ones slipped through. Please post any errors.\n\nI did my best. There are 44 albums here. These are from his Capitol and Reprise years. I also included his last proper album L.A. is My Lady. I am missing &quot;Close To You and More,&quot; &quot;Sinatra's Swingin Sessions&quot; &amp; More.&quot;his soundtracks and maybe one or two others. You can check against All Music Guides page:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3iftxqw5ldhe~T2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3iftxqw5ldhe~T2&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI listened to most of the Capitol recordings but not much else. I will do this in the next few weeks. If anyone can fill in missing songs (there are a few here and there) and add missing albums it would be appreciated. I couldn't find any complete Columbia torrents. \n\nMy goal is to eventually have his entire catalog in this torrent. If anyone can add to this and upload it, I will gladly delete this. Any comments are welcome.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a4573330b9f934c10e17bc9e80811a252ea16f","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+Discography+Capitol%2FReprise+Fully+Tagged+Organiz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a4573330b9f934c10e17bc9e80811a252ea16f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,164,87,51,48,185,249,52,193,14,23,188,158,128,129,26,37,46,161,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
