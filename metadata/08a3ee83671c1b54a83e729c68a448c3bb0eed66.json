It gave the crowd something completely unique and very special for the celebration of 10 years of EXIT. I had an amazing time and thought it was absolutely exceptional the way the crowd stayed with us until the morning and had a celebration. I felt honored and proud to be asked to do this and I hope that I can get to play at EXIT a few more times in the years to come.&quot; \nCarl Cox\n\n&quot;FUCK! That was fun...&quot;  \nLee Burridge\n\n&quot;Exit was a pleasure as always, also this year they really pushed the production of the dance stage which was great as it looked amazing, long live EXIT Festival&quot; \nSteve Lawler\n\n&quot;Once again Exit proves to be one of the best festivals in the world!!!&quot; \nNic Fancuilli\n\n&quot;Playing the Exit Festival's 10th Birthday was an honour, especially given the social background of the event. I've always loved Exit and I had so much fun, much of which was provided by once more playing back to back with my close friend Yousef. Bravo!&quot;\nPaul Woolford\n\n&quot;Exit Festival has to be one of the most special festivals we have ever played. Just staring out from the stage to over 20,000 ravers was one of the pinnacle moments of our career.  The atmosphere was amazing and the festival organizers were the best yet! Its going to be hard to beat!!&quot;\nJapanese Popstars \n\nCOME IN SERBIA NEXT YEAR AND VISIT EXIT FESTIVAL,IT'S FUCKING AWESOME!!!:D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08a3ee83671c1b54a83e729c68a448c3bb0eed66","amp;dn":"The+Prodigy+Live%40EXIT+FESTIVAL+2009%5Bmp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08a3ee83671c1b54a83e729c68a448c3bb0eed66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,163,238,131,103,28,27,84,168,62,114,156,104,164,72,195,187,14,237,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
