He was also one of the most identifiable and misunderstood pop icons of the 20th century. This engrossing British documentary shows the complex layers of this magnificent and mercurial artist. Through rare footage and interviews, we learn of Davis's middle-class upbringing and his early days with bop legends Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. The documentary bluntly deals with Davis's narcotic nadir and his rise from the depths to become a bona fide jazz icon in the mid-'50s to late '60s. But the most penetrating and poignant portraits of Davis come from musicians who played with and were influenced by him, including Shirley Horn, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, and Keith Jarrett.\nOutstanding musical selections include modal masterpieces &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;Blue in Green,&quot; the haunting soundtrack to the 1957 French film Ascenseur pour l'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©chafaud, his romantic rendition of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Time After Time,&quot; and his collaborations with arranger Gil Evans. The most surprising aspects of Davis's personality that emerge from this film are his shyness, vulnerability, and, yes, humility. As he said himself, &quot;Don't call me a legend. Call me Miles Davis.&quot; --Eugene Holley Jr. \n\n\n\nThe Miles Davis Story explores the music &amp; the man behind the public image from Miles middle class upbringing in racially segregated East St. Louis to the last years when he travelled the world like a rock star. \n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : F:\\DVD\\Miles Davis Story.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 1.19 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 3mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 376 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (MPEG)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 2h 3mn\nBit rate                         : 1 174 Kbps\nWidth  x Height           : 624  x 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.214\nStream size                      : 1.01 GiB (85%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio Version 1 Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 3mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 170 MiB (14%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97b\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 18.6 -b 192\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3d3efa728da6eab8782bbcd234c580c69dc8e0","amp;dn":"Miles+Davis+The+Miles+Davis+Story%28musi+doc%29%28avi%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3d3efa728da6eab8782bbcd234c580c69dc8e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,61,62,250,114,141,166,234,184,120,43,188,210,52,197,128,198,157,200,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
