Its affect on the heart is direct and swift due to the intricate connection between our souls and the roots of the notes. Hearing Kabbalistic melodies over and over again allows the listener to feel the music penetrating deep within the soul, completely unobstructed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2674999f0d455bb2a0eeeccf3216d32c32cadbfa","amp;dn":"Kabbalah+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2674999f0d455bb2a0eeeccf3216d32c32cadbfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,116,153,159,13,69,91,178,160,238,236,207,50,22,211,44,50,202,219,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
