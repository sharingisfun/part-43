From a theme aspect we can intrepidly consider it as a concept album, dedicated to the 'big figures' of the polish and world cinema.\n\nWhat comes to the music - the CD is very compact, enriched with dynamic patterns, creating a self-collage. Like a picture of a good director. Lebowski holds listeners in tension, changing the moods, playing according to emotions. Complex and multidimensional compositions, are enabling a surprising and dynamic plot. The entirety is completed with rich instrumental use and the whole ensemble is an interesting arrangement, where the music isn't held from being in some cases ascetic, modest and soft.\nLyrics for the &quot;Cinematic&quot; are original quotes adopted from the classical polish and international movies.\n\nLebowski:\nmarcin grzegorczyk - guitars \nmarcin luczaj - synths \nmarek zak ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nkrzysztof pakula ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\nTracklist:\n1.
