Now if the launcher doesn't detect an active internet connection or detects that the server is offline, it will launch a server locally so that you can still play.\n\nQ: Ubisoft Game Launcher asks for a username and password. What do I do?\nA: You can login with any username/password combination.\n\nQ: What if you release a newer version of your application? Do I have to download it again?\nA: No, the application features an update function which is accessible through the About window.\n\nQ: But what if I launch AC2 without your Launcher? Will it update to the latest legit version - making it unplayable?\nA: No, as soon as my launcher is launched one time with an active internet connection it will download a modified version of UGL, which will only auto-update from my server.\n\nQ: What if my internet disconnects while I'm in-game?\nA: The game will display a &quot;Lost Network Connection&quot; message. As soon as internet connection is regained the game will reconnect to the server and will let you continue the game.\n\nQ: It says that I don't have Assassin's Creed II installed while I have it.\nA: First of all make sure that it is INSTALLED and not copied from another computer. Also if you are under Windows 7 or Vista try running the launcher as an Administrator.\n\nQ: While I was in-game a &quot;Lost Network Connection&quot; message appeared while I still had internet. What now?\nA: This usually happens when the server restarts (every 2-6 hours). The game should automatically reconnect after 2-10 seconds. If it hasn't reconnected after 30 seconds it means that the server is offline, in which case you must close the game and restart the launcher (sad I know).\n\nQ: Ok, the game disconnected and then reconnected but the message appeared for about 5 more times. Should I worry about it?\nA: No. This usually happens when the server restarts and more that 100 clients are connecting at the same time. These messages should disappear after 10-30 seconds.\n\nQ: Are you freaking stupid? We don't need a replacement to ubisoft's servers. We need an one-click offline crack!@%^!\nA: First of all, a central server that a lot users can connect and play at the same time is more convenient to almost everyone. Secondly, this is why the app has an offline/local mode. Thirdly, if you don't like it don't use it...\n\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen3.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://n0.pointlimit.com/images/ac2screen4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \nCredits:\nNoFaTe - Application Creator, Server Modification, Server Hosting\nDomine - Server Creator\nCS.RIN.RU Community - Latest Values\n\nPlease report any bugs at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1977767f786d7c59697670776d757074706d377a7674&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThanks to my friend NoFaTe from the rzking forum, go there for support:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rzking.co.cc/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=761&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rzking.co.cc/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=761&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab469f740229c19a74dc5d969270fb06e7d930ea","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+2+Launcher+-+Play+AC2+The+Easy+Way+V1.15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab469f740229c19a74dc5d969270fb06e7d930ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,70,159,116,2,41,193,154,116,220,93,150,146,112,251,6,231,217,48,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
