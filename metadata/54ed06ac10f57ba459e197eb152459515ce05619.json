Many of the characters are based on ruses developed by real Cannonball racers over the several years that the event was run.\n\n\nCannonball Run II\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087032/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087032/&lt;/a&gt;\nOur racers are back for a second cannonball run - the illegal race that takes place all over the country...
