Faking like you made it all alone but you were legally with Regal, part of Parlophone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ oh yes. So when you lectured me, I thought IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d fileshare my thoughts on your mp3, Lily.\n\nNow first I must sing your praises ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I love your singing but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll just say this: I saw on your MySpace pages saying filesharingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a new ice age, but the industryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a recent innovation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been alive, thriving since cavemen. Folk songs so long have had a place in communities that you should be amazed at it. Then one day came intellectual property, meaning if I think a thought, you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t copy me. And if honestyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the best policy, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d say songs are better off without this monopoly. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d blatantly be a major fail if theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d patented the major scale. And downloads donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t equate to sales, so taking them away wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make me pay up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just procludes me from sending your tunes to my friends, so we all lose in the end. You lose potential fans and we lose respect for the fact that youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re desperate for cash. But what do you expect from the lass whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s collecting a fat bank cheque from the man, while her fans are collecting the glasses for minimum wage theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll spend on her tracks?\n\nNow please donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be offended, Lily; I think your new CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s splendid, Lily. EverybodyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s at It and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Not Fair, I Could Say, The Fear was Him but He wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t There so letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s go Back to the Start, before 22 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in the public domain, so Fuck You.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never the amateurs thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reckon itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s damaging us, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the major labels saying itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fatal; like when Napster had to pack up, wrecked by Metallica. The tableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s turned now ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the labels churn out a new Jezebelinternetelevangelist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fit ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with a manuscript that was actually written by Mr. Michael Masnick. Can you get the irony? And by the by, Lily, I like this beat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I hope you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mind me thieving, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢cause even doing a cover songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decried as stealing. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alright, still, for you to plagiarise, and preach it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t you believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s maybe time to rethink, Lily?\n\nPut music back in the hands of the people; make the majors and amateurs equal. If anything labels strangle the freedom you claim theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re saving by banning this evil. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the actual reason, you see; and please donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t compare sharing to stealing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve not took anything off you, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m just spreading love for what you do. Downloaded your songs for free, then I bought my mom your CD. She likes it too, she keeps telling me, all because I pirated an mp3. Now IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got Matt Bellamy belling me, telling me IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a fan, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m the enemy. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s amusing, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve paid enough to see Muse in my time I could buy them a museum. Did you see them on that programme miming? Yeah, the pirates are killing live gigs. Maybe we should have a ban CDs appeal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ then people would pay to see bands for real. Dear Lily, why are you being this silly?\n\nYours sincerely,\nDan Bull\n\nP.S. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ And I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean any offence or anything, Lily. I just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think the issueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as clear cut as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re making out. And I know youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to carry on making music really. But when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re between the devil and the deep blue sea, you need to stop worrying about pirates, and adjust your sails.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e14dbd077c920875be4c15971b23b609ad6716a","amp;dn":"Dan+Bull+-+Dear+Lily+%5Ban+open+letter+to+Lily+Allen%5D+-+2009%5BMP3+%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e14dbd077c920875be4c15971b23b609ad6716a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,20,219,208,119,201,32,135,91,228,193,89,113,178,59,96,154,214,113,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
