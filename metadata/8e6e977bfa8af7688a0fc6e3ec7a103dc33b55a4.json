These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.\n\nEpisode Info: Frontline policing is the heart and soul of what the RCMP does every day and every night. From their home bases in over 750 detachments, they hit the streets in cruisers or on foot in an effort to maintain peace and order across the country. Round the clock, meet the officers who call the streets their home.\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. \n\nThe website for this show is here: http://courageinred.ca/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6e977bfa8af7688a0fc6e3ec7a103dc33b55a4","amp;dn":"Courage.in.Red.S01E09.Frontline.Policing.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6e977bfa8af7688a0fc6e3ec7a103dc33b55a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,110,151,123,250,138,247,104,138,15,198,227,236,122,16,61,195,59,85,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
