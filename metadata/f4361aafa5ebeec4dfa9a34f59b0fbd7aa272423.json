The band's musical style incorporates classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into hard rock and heavy metal. The orchestra is most famous for their Christmas-themed series of rock operas (Christmas Eve and Other Stories, The Christmas Attic, and The Lost Christmas Eve), for which they do an annual winter tour. Their other releases are based on historical themes (Beethoven's Last Night and Night Castle). Trans-Siberian Orchestra is also known for their extensive charity work and elaborate concerts, which are complete with a full orchestra, a massive light show, lasers, dozens of pyrotechnics, moving trusses, video screens, and other effects that are synchronized to the actual music.\n\nThe Trans-Siberian Orchestra is known for their incorporation of classical, orchestral, symphonic, and progressive elements into rock and heavy metal music. They are listed under many genres, but mostly symphonic rock, progressive rock, neo-classical metal, and classical music. Three of their albums ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Christmas Eve and Other Stories (1996), The Christmas Attic (1998 ), The Lost Christmas Eve (2004) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are based around Christmas themes. These rock operas, collectively known as the &quot;Christmas trilogy,&quot; remain their best-selling and most famous works.\n\nBoth in the recording studio and live, Trans-Siberian Orchestra uses a full orchestra, choirs, and a constantly growing and changing group of singers and musicians. It was founded and is produced and led by head composer and lyricist Paul O'Neill, alongside composer and vocalist Jon Oliva and guitarist and music director Al Pitrelli (both members of the progressive metal band Savatage), with co-producer, composer, and keyboardist Robert Kinkel.\n\nChristmas Eve and Other Stories is an album of Christmas carols by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. This album, a rock opera, takes familiar carols and adds to them the rock influence for which the Trans-Siberian Orchestra is known. The album contains a mix of vocal and instrumental songs. The primary musicians on the album are from the heavy metal band Savatage, and the producer of the album, Paul O'Neill, is Savatage's long-time producer. Jon Oliva, one of the principle songwriters on the album, is a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and original vocalist in Savatage.\n\nAs of December 5, 2008, Christmas Eve and Other Stores was the tenth best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the Nielsen/SoundScan era of music sales tracking (1991-present), with sales of at least 2,821,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nOn November 18, 2004, Christmas Eve and Other Stores was certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of two million copies in the United States.[/spoiler]\n\n\nTrackList\n\n01 - An Angel Came Down\n02 - O Come All Ye Faithful/O Holy Night\n03 - A Star To Follow\n04 - First Snow\n05 - The Silent Nutcracker\n06 - A Mad Russian's Christmas\n07 - The Prince Of Peace\n08 - Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\n09 - Good King Joy\n10 - Ornament\n11 - The First Noel\n12 - Old City Bar\n13 - Promises To Keep\n14 - This Christmas Day\n15 - An Angel Returned\n16 - O Holy Night\n17 - God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nFormato                          : MPEG Audio\nVersione del formato             : Version 1\nProfilo del formato              : Layer 3\nModalitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â                          : Costante\nBitRate                          : 320 Kbps\nCanali                           : 2 canali\nSamplingRate                     : 44,1 KHz\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nJoin www.nautilus-bt.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4361aafa5ebeec4dfa9a34f59b0fbd7aa272423","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+Christmas+Eve+and+Other+Stories+%5BMP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4361aafa5ebeec4dfa9a34f59b0fbd7aa272423","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,54,26,175,165,235,238,196,223,169,163,79,89,176,251,215,170,39,36,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
