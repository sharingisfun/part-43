German adults are portrayed in classic Disney &quot;sinister bulldog&quot; style: barrel chest, small rear end, bowed legs, and no neck. The bellowing, red-faced instructor's jowls flop around like coattails as he berates a kindergarten classroom full of Bambi-eyed waifs in lederhosen, whose pluckish heads are delightfully oversized.
