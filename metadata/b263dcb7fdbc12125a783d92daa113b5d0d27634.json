The track was produced by Tony Kanal and Jimmy Harry. Pink explained that this song is, &quot;about when the box you're in doesn't fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one.&quot; \n\nThe music video was directed by Dave Meyers and premiered on June 20, 2009 in the United Kingdom on 4music at 11:00am. Tony Kanal of No Doubt, also the co-writer and the producer of the song, appears in the music video, playing a piano. References to the lyrics are made, like &quot;I'm gonna burn it down&quot; and &quot;But now it's full of evil clowns&quot;, showing a burning set and &quot;Evil Clowns&quot;, respectively.\n\nThe video takes place in an barren lot that is later shown to be what's left of a house that is still burning. There are 'evil clowns' throughout the area who are picking though the rubble and playing the instruments as the band.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nVideo\n-----\nDVD Rip from the official music video 'Pink - Fun House'...\n\n\nVideo Format     - AVI (container) / XviD (codec)\nVideo Quality    - ~2100kbps\nVideo Resolution - 1008 x 448\nFrame Rate       - 30 fps\n   \nSound Quality    - 192kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\n\nSeed, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b263dcb7fdbc12125a783d92daa113b5d0d27634","amp;dn":"Pink+-+Fun+House+%5B2009%5D%5BGOLDFiSH_XviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b263dcb7fdbc12125a783d92daa113b5d0d27634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,99,220,183,253,188,18,18,90,120,61,146,218,161,19,181,208,210,118,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
