Based on Autopano Pro software and including all its featues, Autopano Giga goes far beyond the creation of panoramas : stitch your images in 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°, export them into Flash virtual tours, link the tours together... so many possibilities to present in a new way all the photos and places you want to share. Resolution matters? Autopano Giga also enables you to stitch in a record time several hundred or thousand images to create photos of several gigapixels.\n\nWebsite:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.kolor.com/v3/en/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.kolor.com/v3/en/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMain features:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Automatic picture retrieval\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Color correction\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Smartblend ghost-remover\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Support of motorized panoramic heads\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Export in Flash, creation of virtual tours\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fisheye lens\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Clean and easy interface\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Fully automatic stitching\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full HDR stitching support\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Support for hundred of file formats\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Batch rendering manager\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Multiple processor support\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Control Point Editor to manage complicated case\n\nChangelog\nMain changes\n- FIX : Multiband rendering engine improvement to get better blended result in all modes.\n- NEW : Russian translation integration\n- FIX : PSD / PSB output layers order\n\nFixes :\n- 0000564: [Cortex ( rendu )] Blue Patches on HDR rendering - resolved.\n- 0000565: [Cortex ( rendu )] Crash when rendering a panorama with empty layer - resolved.\n- 0000560: [Image I/O] Tiff loading crash - resolved.\n- 0000559: [Cortex ( rendu )] Rendering in mercator doesn't work - resolved.\n- 0000556: [Cortex ( rendu )] One line of pixels can sometimes appears in the middle of the rendering - resolved.\n- 0000537: [Shell Integration] Shell explorer doesn't display thumb from RC2 - resolved.\n- 0000551: [Unclassified] Fuji s5 not supported anymore ( cameras.txt database issue ) - resolved.\n- 0000552: [Cortex ( rendu )] Crash rendering during projection - resolved.\n- 0000521: [Cortex ( rendu )] PSD : embed all removes exifs - resolved.\n- 0000542: [Cortex ( rendu )] HDR output not really working - resolved.\n- 0000544: [Cortex ( rendu )] HDR consistency (rcoudray) - resolved.\n- 0000536: [translation] Editeur de groupe =&gt; editeur de couche - resolved.\n- 0000495: [translation] mac : general menu entries not translated - resolved.\n- 0000548: [Shell Integration] Keys update ( APG retrieved an old 1.4 keys for autopano pro only ) - resolved.\n- 0000535: [Synapse ( detection )] Cancelling detection on group leads to hang - resolved.\n- 0000411: [Cortex ( rendu )] Blending quality : new engine versus smartblend - resolved.\n\nCompatibility\n\nAutopano Giga runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\nMinimal configuration\n\n    * Operating system:\n          o Microsoft Windows 7, Vista, XP or 2000\n          o or Apple Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, 10.5 Leopard or 10.4 Tiger running on an Intel-based Mac only\n          o or Linux kernel 2.6 or superior\n    * Processor: 1 GHz\n    * RAM: 2 Gb\n    * Display: resolution of 1024x768 minimum\n    * A sufficient hard disk space depending on the size of the panoramas you process\n\nRecommended configuration\n\n    * The 64-bit version of your operating system if your hardware can handle it (eg.
