Rather than confuse you with tons of commands, Blitz3D's command set has been carefully designed to provide maximum flexibility for minimum effort.\n\nCan you write commercial quality games in Blitz3D? Why not - others are! Great titles such as Best Friends, Wonderland and Juno Nemesis were written in Blitz. In fact, many shareware authors are moving to Blitz from languages such as C++ due to the faster development time.\n\nBe courtious, seed this torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfcdb99b7a335a5a1b922b988822cb54abc31330","amp;dn":"Blitz3D+-+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfcdb99b7a335a5a1b922b988822cb54abc31330","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,205,185,155,122,51,90,90,27,146,43,152,136,34,203,84,171,195,19,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
