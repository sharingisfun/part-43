Whether he's self-effacing, full of himself, or both is up for debate, and we can't gather much of why he's in the poetry biz besides for the purpose of meeting girls. (There's a wonderful CanCon moment where, on some stereotypical CBC panel discussion program, Pierre Burton grills him on this point, and Cohen refuses to play along).\n\nWhile it is a nice time capsule of Montreal in the early '60s, whether or not you enjoy this depends on how you feel about L.C., and about the possibility of poetry embiggining the human spirit. Myself, I'm a bit of a sucker for it.\n\nimdb link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126376/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afb7571a34ec525f237ef125caf7bfda3d897976","amp;dn":"Ladies+And+Gentlemen%2C+Mr.+Leonard+Cohen+-+Donald+Brittain+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afb7571a34ec525f237ef125caf7bfda3d897976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,183,87,26,52,236,82,95,35,126,241,37,202,247,191,218,61,137,121,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
