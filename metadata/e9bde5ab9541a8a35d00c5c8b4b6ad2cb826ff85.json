Written by Simon Passmore; Directed by Sasha Yevtushenko.\n\nDavid and Helen, a professional couple in their mid-twenties, are shocked when Jamie, an old friend from university, dies unexpectedly. At the funeral, they meet Mark, another mutual friend. Mark implies that he works for Special Services, and tells them that Jamie, a high-flying investment banker, may have killed himself - and that his bank has been under investigation. Did Jamie contact the couple before he died? As Mark teases out information, Helen begins to suspect he is not entirely innocent. Mark's questions turn into threats, and people start getting hurt. David and Helen find they must expose a murder before it's too late.\n\nHelen . . . . . Claire Foy\nDavid . . . . . Blake Ritson\nMark . . . . . Charlie Cox\nKendra . . . . .
