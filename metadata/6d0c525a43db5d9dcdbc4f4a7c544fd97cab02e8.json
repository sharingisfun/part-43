Due to problems within the band, Richie Havens became the first performer. One of their best known songs is Motherless Child.\n\nSweetwater pioneered the psychedelic rock/classical fusion style that was popularized by Jefferson Airplane to be regarded as the archetype &quot;60s Sound&quot;. In 1968-69, the band often toured with The Doors. They were also one of the opening acts for Eric Burdon &amp; The Animals in 1968.\n\nThe original members of the band were Nancy Nevins (lead vocals), August Burns (cello), Albert Moore (flute/backing vocals), Alan Malarowitz (drums), Elpidio Cobian (conga drums), Alex Del Zoppo (keyboards) and Fred Herrera (bass).\n\nThree days after Sweetwater performed on The Red Skelton Show (December 1969), singer Nancy Nevins was severely injured in a car accident, which stopped the progress of the band. Due to the accident, Nancy experienced brain damage for a number of years following the collision, and permanent damage to one of her vocal cords.\n\nThe group reunited for Woodstock '94 in 1994 with three original members - Nevins, Herrera and Del Zoppo. August Burns died in the 80s, Alan Malarowitz was killed in a car crash near 1981, Albert Moore died of pneumonia in the 1994. Elpedio Cobian works as a film statist. In 1999, the story of the band was depicted in a VH1 TV-movie called Sweetwater: A True Rock Story. Amy Jo Johnson portrayed Nancy Nevins, while Michelle Phillips portrayed a much older Nancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23. January 2008\n\nEAC extraction logfile from 6.
