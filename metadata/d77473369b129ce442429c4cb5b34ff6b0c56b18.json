His ballet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Great MassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the most impressive works of this important neoclassical Choreographer - a requiem, a choreographic revelation and certainly his grand legacy to the Leipzig ballet. \n\nThe full length Choreography, here recorded at the Leipzig Opera in a performance in June 2005, takes its name from Mozart's famous unfinished Mass in C minor. It absorbs the structure of the liturgy of the mass and adds other works by Mozart as well as passages of Gregorian chant, and sequences from contemporary music by GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy KurtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡g, Thomas Jahn and Arvo PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rt and readings of poems by Paul Celan. \n\nInternationally famous soloists from the Leipzig Ballet, among them Kiyoko Kimura, Christoph BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶hm and Oksana Kulchytska, take on the leading roles and the staging proves the ensemble to be one of the best ballet companies worldwide.\n\n\n\nREPERTOIRE:\nW.A.
