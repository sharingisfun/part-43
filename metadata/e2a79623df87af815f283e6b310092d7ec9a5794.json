In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack (reportedly his fifth) after overdosing on his muse at his studio.\n\n\n\nDescription:\nIf you only own one DJ Screw CD, this should be the one, a classic of the chopped &amp; screwed remix. Track two on disc one, &quot;We Got The Hook Up,&quot; is one of the best examples of chopping, Disc two and three feature freestyles over excellent original rhythm tracks and last for most of each disc. This is a must-buy for the curious, as well as the longtime DJ Screw fan.\n\n\nDISC 1: \n 1. Never Trust 12:11 \n 2. We Got The Hook Up 8:33 \n 3. Ghetto 8:43 \n 4. Bounce With Me 9:19 \n 5.
