Common manutacturing defects make these hard to find in Mint/Near Mint grades. Most Giant-Sized books contained an original story, plus a reprinted follow-up story.\n\nRepacked: Changed all names of images contained in CBR archives to be consistent, to make sure all readers will get them all in the correct order. Removed duplicate double pages. Combined split 2-page spreads. All files packed in CBR format. Ads removed. \n\nAll files sourced from the Complete Marvel Chronology Project, courtesy of PeteThePIPster.\n\nAll files are named with year and month of release, if you put my packs in the same folder you will automatically have a chronological collection.\n\nTAKING REQUESTS: PM your Marvel requests to drknark at\n\nFormat: CBR\nPublisher: Marvel\nRelease Dates: Jul 1974 - Oct 1975\nIssues: #1-#6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeab0193e804c8e0eb2093bd632d9d6d1f093391","amp;dn":"Giant-Size+Spider-Man+Complete+Repacked+No+Ads+%5Bdrknark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeab0193e804c8e0eb2093bd632d9d6d1f093391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,171,1,147,232,4,200,224,235,32,147,189,99,45,157,109,31,9,51,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
