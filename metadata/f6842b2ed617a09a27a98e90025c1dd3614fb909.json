Dr. Phil sits down with couples struggling to figure out their next step after learning a deep, dark secret. Joseph and Natalie have been married less than six months and both say theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re very much in love, but a playful game of dress up awakened repressed feelings from JosephÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s childhood, and now he questions his sexual identity. Are his cross-dressing desires just a phase or indicative of lifelong transgender identity? Is Natalie prepared to hear the truth, and can their marriage survive? And, Carrie caught her husband, Ed, in not just one huge lie, but many! Ed has so many secret ex-wives, children and grandchildren that Dr. Phil has to use a dry erase board to sketch out the new family tree! Are his lies marriage deal-breakers, or can this couple start over from scratch? And, does Ed have more to confess? DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t miss this compelling show!
