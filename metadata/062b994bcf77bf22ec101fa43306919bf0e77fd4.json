ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite a few different sides to FSOL, there is the very, very abstract, what we term the more male, machine music. We tried to not go too extreme into that but keep it melodic, experimental, involving, yes the hits, but in maybe edited or slightly remixed form ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an edit of the Liz Fraser (Cocteau Twins) single on there. But actually, from our point of view, what we consider to be the most long-standing tracks, and try to get the balance right, which I think weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve done quite well.\n                         \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062b994bcf77bf22ec101fa43306919bf0e77fd4","amp;dn":"The+Future+Sound+of+London+-+Teachings+From+the+Electronic+Brain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062b994bcf77bf22ec101fa43306919bf0e77fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,43,153,75,207,119,191,34,236,16,31,164,51,6,145,155,240,231,127,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
