All profits from the album will go to benefit the Susan G. Komen For The Cure breast cancer foundation. So, buy a copy if you want to support this cause!! The project was organized and put together by an independent compilation company, On Joyful Wings. They got 15 different and unique artists, ranging from Bonnie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PrinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Billy to Joshua James to The David Crowder Band, to deliver their own re-working of one of the Swans songs. I think the song I am most looking forward to hearing is Derek WebbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interpretation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the DevilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Territory.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mog.com/blog_posts/2902912/mogbar?a=mn51719&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mog.com/blog_posts/2902912/mogbar?a=mn51719&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
