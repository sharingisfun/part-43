But on the  \n                    island, the only person who is happy to listen  \n                    to him banging on about disability politics is  \n                    Dan, and he's starting to lose interest. It was  \n                    the same story at home - ignored by most  \n                    people, apart from his son Jake and he doesn't  \n                    count. Right now the food is running out for  \n                    the Cast Offs, but Will is insistent that they  \n                    shouldn't ask for help. This is about proving a  \n                    point that disabled people don't need    \n                    assistance. Why can't the others agree with  \n                    him? Elsewhere, romance may be blossoming  \n                    between Dan and Carrie.
