He creates and plays music using authentic and modernized Lithuanian folk as well as electronic instruments; sessional musicians are also invited to cooperate. The project is distinguished for its solid, subtle and mature sound of modern music with Baltic touch. The debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeinainaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released in a tape format in 1998, it was followed by a CD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBaltos Juodos KlajosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhite Black WandersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ , Dangus prod . 2002), the famous work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â vilpiaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhistlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, 2003), a joint project of DONIS with KÃƒâ€¦Ã‚ÂªLGRINDA ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSotvarasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Dangus prod.), an ambient album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVacuumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Autarkeia, 2004), a post-folklore album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBite LingoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and antic &quot;Alexandreia&quot; (Autarkeia, 2007).\nFrom 1994 until now, DONIS collaborates with various projects: Wejdas, Notanga, KÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«lgrinda, etc. Lately, Donatas pays much attention to electronic and experimental music. A wish and potentiality to experiment not only with ambient/folk music reveals itself in a project d.n.s.\n\n*About Donis*\n\n||| Giedrius KupreviÃƒâ€žÃ‚ï¿½ius (composer, dean of the Faculty of Humanities at Kaunas University of Technology):\nAt these disturbing times of cultural transformation there are people that strive to preserve the cells of fundamental feelings and senses. DonisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ progression returning to the section of antediluvian cultural mentality is a successful attempt to convey to us the sounds of that section. Donis' ability to play with modern and archaic expression delights and comforts: his albums are an attestation of these abilities.\n\n*Official Website of the Artist*\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.donis.lt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.donis.lt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nDonis - &quot;Vacuum&quot; CD - 2004 (mp3; CBR; 320 kb/s)\n\nAutarkeia\n\nThis is not the latest Donis' record. It was recorded in 1997, when Lithuania was still in deepest electronic music crisis. &quot;Vacuum&quot; had waited seven years for his real live in personal Donis' archive. The album consists of only one long track, that could be ascribed to &quot;ambient' stylistics. Tough the sound of album proposes feeling of dark emptiness, it can not be described as &quot;dark ambient&quot;. By it's influence &quot;Vacuum&quot; reminds &quot;Coil's&quot; ambient works that take you to the psychedelic trip. Extremely low generator vibration in record doesn't allow the feeling that you're high in the mountains to go out. The air is being crossed by toneless and icy sound, music motives are deep and sharp. Every stream of sound will work out as if you, the listener, are in a trip of deep emptiness.\n\n \n\nAlbum lasts for 65 minutes. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s packed in a special black DVD box. We recommend you to listen to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVacuumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ only on Hi-fi stereo. Limited edition 499 copies.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
