In terms of the internal chronology, it falls near the end of the war of independence. It is set in the Seattle area, and a large portion of the book is devoted to the Longview Conference in which the United States and the Northwest Volunteer Army negotiate an end to the war....\n\nA Mighty Fortress is the first novel of the Quartet that I read, and I lucked out, because I think it is the best place to start. Literarily, it is one of the best written and most moving. In these terms, it is second only to The Brigade, which is my favorite.

The NAR comprises the present US states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, plus parts of Northern California, Montana, and Wyoming. These states secede from the United States through a bitter five-year guerrilla war fought by the Northwest Volunteer Army. The NVA is an armed political party. Its ideology owes much to German National Socialism, but its tactics are modeled on the Irish Republican Army and the mafia, as well as Muslim organizations like Hamas in Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the insurgents who have stymied the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan...'\ncont. online \n\n\nAlso includes \n44 ways to support jihad\nand\nthe NS Brotherhood also by Covington","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f3d0109173752931ce6440b089a1acbe5c6d5b5","amp;dn":"A+Mighty+Fortress+by+Harold+Covington","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f3d0109173752931ce6440b089a1acbe5c6d5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,61,1,9,23,55,82,147,28,230,68,11,8,154,26,203,229,198,213,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
