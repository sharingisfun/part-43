In it, he uses the camera as an all-seeing eye witnessing the divine mystery of creationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the soulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movement into matter and the first glimpse of Eden.\nDin of Celestial Birds, visually takes us on a journey into the darkness, mystery and struggle of origin and will be a living statement and invitation to consider an alternative model for the purpose and function of art and creativity.\n\nDin of Celestial Birds is a fantastic barrage of a film, and a riveting view of creation. Director E. Elias Merhige (best known for Begotten) takes the helm of a great collection of video artists, musicians, painters, and philosophers in a 14 minute experimental film. The music by Ben Gellespie is stark at times, with many interesting movements of tribal percussion and processed voices. The general fuzziness has a interesting hypnotic effect and makes the sharper imagery more effective.
