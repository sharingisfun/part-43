Amanda Zimm is Jewish. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her mother, but still sees her father. She is an only child. She is a pretty young girl who is interested in boys, drama, poetry and shopping. Elizabeth Ramone or Busy as everyone calls her is Italian. She is a tomboy who is interested in sports and playing the drums. She comes from a big family and lives with her parents who own a meat shop. She has three older brothers. Laura Bertram and Lani Billard play Amanda and Busy. They both give great performances in each episode. Ready or Not is a brilliant teen show from the 90's which is still great to watch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:074bfc3406610a3443b9f9250df4893b67367de3","amp;dn":"Ready+or+Not+%281993-1997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"074bfc3406610a3443b9f9250df4893b67367de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,75,252,52,6,97,10,52,67,185,249,37,13,244,137,59,103,54,125,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
