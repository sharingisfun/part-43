Pioneers with proven staying power, Christafari has been going strong for two decades now, from the time of founder Mark Mohr s saving encounter with Christ at a youth camp. Mohr has not wavered from his initial dream of bringing gospel reggae to America, a counter-cultural drug-aversion ministry to win the lost, especially those lost in the drug culture, as he had been. The band has also performed at two Olympics, as well as before an American president, and To The Foundation is still going strong with the same message, serving up fifteen tracks of joyous, organic reggae. \n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84fca83c013e1022d7e126cb21f5ff9906534865","amp;dn":"Christafari+-+2007+-+To+The+Foundation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84fca83c013e1022d7e126cb21f5ff9906534865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,252,168,60,1,62,16,34,215,225,38,203,33,245,255,153,6,83,72,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
