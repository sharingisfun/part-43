Most accidents happen at home.&quot; Zevon's own demon-infested past, still-mordant humor, and post-midlife peace of mind meet on Life'll Kill Ya, his finest effort in more than a decade. From visions of decay (&quot;I Was in the House When the House Burned Down&quot;) to hopes of deliverance (&quot;Don't Let Us Get Sick&quot; and a cover of Steve Winwood's &quot;Back in the High Life&quot;), Zevon makes a compelling statement of strength and cockeyed wisdom.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWarren Zevon - percussion, keyboards, piccolo, theremin, vocals, penny whistle, harmonica\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n - bass, guitar, percussion, vocals\nDennis Collins - vocals on &quot;Fistful of Rain&quot;\nBabi Floyd - vocals on &quot;Fistful of Rain&quot;\nCurtis King - vocals on &quot;Fistful of Rain&quot;\nChuck Prophet - guitar on &quot;For My Next Trick I'll Need a Volunteer&quot;\nJim Ryan - mandolin on &quot;Ourselves to Know&quot;\nWinston Watson - percussion, snare drums\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;I Was in the House When the House Burned Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n2.&quot;Life'll Kill Ya&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:47\n3.&quot;Porcelain Monkey&quot; (Jorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.&quot;For My Next Trick I'll Need a Volunteer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n5.&quot;I'll Slow You Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n6.&quot;Hostage-O&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n7.&quot;Dirty Little Religion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n8.&quot;Back in the High Life Again&quot; (Will Jennings, Steve Winwood) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n9.&quot;My Shit's Fucked Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n10.&quot;Fistful of Rain&quot; (Jorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n, Zevon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n11.&quot;Ourselves to Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n12.&quot;Don't Let Us Get Sick&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29de6771c70a914ab27cbb0e45b15097a7a8e58e","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+Life%5C%27ll+Kill+Ya++%5B2000%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29de6771c70a914ab27cbb0e45b15097a7a8e58e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,222,103,113,199,10,145,74,178,124,187,14,69,177,80,151,167,168,229,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
