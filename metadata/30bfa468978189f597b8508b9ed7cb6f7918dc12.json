This encyclopedia is a gem! This is one of the most important works of social history of our time.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Cornel West, Princeton University\n\n\n\n&quot;This eight-volume encyclopedia is an indispensable reference tool for scholars, students, and activists seeking information about revolutionary social movements, left-politics, and radical leaders. Immanuel Ness has put together a very impressive team of international scholars, many of whom have defined their fields. The result is a comprehensive compilation that reflects the most recent scholarly interpretations. \n\nWhat distinguishes this encyclopedia is the way it incorporates the social history literature of the past two generations with its focus on protest movements, ordinary working people, and the how the struggle for social justice was defined by class, race, gender, and ethnicity. This encyclopedia provides a window into the process of revolutionary social change, the relationships between leaders and rank and file, workers, peasants, and state power. Its transnational perspective clarifies the role that revolutionary nationalism and the struggles against European colonialism played in the world-wide movement for social change. This is the definitive reference work in its area.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Michael Nash, Director, Tamiment Library, New York University\n\n\n\n&quot;This voluminous encyclopedia is a timely and wonderful thematic compilation of peer-reviewed reference material that will contribute significantly to a broad range of social science disciplines.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Diana Lachatanere, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library\n\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFor this work Immanuel Ness has assembled an impressive team of international scholarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Undoubtedly, this will become an essential reference on world revolutionary and protest movements, and an important addition to the collections of academic and larger public libraries. I know I will recommend it to our students and faculty, and will consult it frequently for my own research.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Thomas Twiss, Government Information Librarian, University of Pittsburgh\n\n\n\n&quot;An indispensable tool for social scientists and historians who wish to be aware of their rich and colourful past. The scope is breathtaking - with a wealth of engagingly presented detail gathered by an army of researchers under the sure guidance of Immanuel Ness. Wiley is to be congratulated.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Raymond Markey, Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand\n\n\n\n&quot;Finally a scholarly reference work that provides a substantive approach to world history that accounts for the essential role played by popular movements in the processes of revolution, social change and progress. The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest traces the efforts of peasants and workers in the global South and North as they struggle for justice and power from the emergence of European colonialism to the present.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Gary Younge, The Guardian and The Nation\n\n\n\n&quot;This compilation of historical essays provides a unique contribution to the study of social radicalism.
