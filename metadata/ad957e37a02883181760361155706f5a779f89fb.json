Otherwise the server emulator can't work. \n\nThanks to rapscallion from piratebay who notified me about this\n\nKindly seed to keep the torrent alive.\n\nNKP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad957e37a02883181760361155706f5a779f89fb","amp;dn":"Assassins+Creed+2-NKP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad957e37a02883181760361155706f5a779f89fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,149,126,55,160,40,131,24,23,96,54,17,85,112,111,90,119,159,137,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
