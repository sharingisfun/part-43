Covering everything from SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concept of human freedom to his espousal of Marxism and his impact on twentieth-century thought, this is an authoritative work that will challenge undergraduates and general readers alike to think again about human freedom and moral choice.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.oneworld-publications.com/cgi-bin/cart/commerce.cgi?pid=252&amp;&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.oneworld-publications.com/cgi-bin/cart/commerce.cgi?pid=252&amp;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContent:\n\n\nPART I: THE EXISTENTIALIST SARTRE\n   \n1 Sartre and phenomenology 3\n     Intentionality 5\n     The priority of lived experience over the objective viewpoint 6\n     Sartre and objectivism 10\n     A human world 16\n     Quality as the revelation of being 24\n\n2 In-itself, for-itself and for-others: \n     SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ontology 29\n     The in-itself and the for-itself 29\n     Being for others 37\n\n3 From ontology to anti-essentialism: \n     SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attack on human nature 41\n     Existentialism and human nature 41\n     Assessing the arguments 45\n     Consequences of anti-essentialism 49\n     The temporality of the for-itself 55\n\n4 From ontology to ethics 59\n     The ethics of authenticity 59\n\n5 Authenticity and bad faith 75\n\n6 Freedom 87\n     The original project 93\n     How free is the for-itself? 99\n\n\nPART II: THE LATER SARTRE\n\n7 Existentialism and Marxism 119\n     The structure of the Critique of Dialectical Reason 125\n\n8 SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s second philosophy of freedom 133\n\n\n\n\nDr Neil Levy is Lecturer in philosophy, School of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences. \n\nDr Neil Levy is still alive, which I can't say for Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre, so if you want to support him buy a papperback at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sartre-Oneworld-Philosophers-Neil-Levy/dp/1851682902&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Sartre-Oneworld-Philosophers-Neil-Levy/dp/1851682902&lt;/a&gt;\n\n(You can find them for $0.99 in very good condition and for $1.99 as new print)\n\n\nMore on book, read in this review: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://atheism.about.com/od/existentialism/fr/Sartre.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://atheism.about.com/od/existentialism/fr/Sartre.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdd1904b367534f5fb1f8333a43016c77234982f","amp;dn":"Sartre+-+Neil+Levy+%28Oneworld+philosophers%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdd1904b367534f5fb1f8333a43016c77234982f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,209,144,75,54,117,52,245,251,31,131,51,164,48,22,199,114,52,152,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
