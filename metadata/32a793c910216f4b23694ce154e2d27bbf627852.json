In my fantasy, I was singin my musical swan song.&quot;\n\nThe improvisations in this concert are really amazing and moving. \n\nIn march 1991, after combating illness for many years, he came back to say goodbye. This time he tries even harder. Knowing that he wont come back, he gives his best performances ever - and performs some of the songs like no one have ever done before and nobody will ever do again.\n\nI hereby present to you Stan Getz in his very best moments.\n\nTrack # 2, 4, 6, and 8 are recorded live at CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Montmartre, cophagen on july 6th 1987\nStan Getz - tenor saxophone\nKenny Barron - piano\nRufus Reid - double bass\nVictor Lewis - drums\n\nTrack # 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 are recorded live at CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Montmartre, cophagen between march 3rd and 6th 1991\nStan Getz - tenor saxophone\nKenny Barron - piano\n\n\n---\n\nEnjoy and please seed by leaving the torrent active in your torrent-program for at least twice the time it took you to download it.
