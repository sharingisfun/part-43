The show's central character is Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional and misanthropic medical genius who heads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ËœPlainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The show's premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character. The show's executive producers include Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio's business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It is largely filmed in Century City.\n\nHouse often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently runs him afoul of his boss (and, later, girlfriend), hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). House's only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology. During the first three seasons, House's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy &quot;Thirteen&quot; Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Kutner was written out of the series toward the end of season five, due to Penn's overriding political commitments. Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six. Cameron then leaves the show, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team.\n\nHouse is critically acclaimed and has high viewer ratings. It was among the top-ten rated shows in the United States from its second through its fourth season; in the 2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“09 season, it fell to nineteenth overall. Distributed to 66 countries, House was the most watched television program in the world in 2008. The show has received several awards, including 9 People's Choice Awards, a Peabody Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and four Primetime Emmy Awards. House's seventh season premiered on September 20, 2010.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4151f6f8a03e27763749c1ea0518174e82c55d87","amp;dn":"House+MD+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3%2C+4%2C+5+%26+6+%2B+Extras+%28Deleted+Scenes%2C+Inte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4151f6f8a03e27763749c1ea0518174e82c55d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,81,246,248,160,62,39,118,55,73,193,234,5,24,23,78,130,197,93,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
