Most of the material is in the form of video tutorials (.ram, Real Media format, playable by VLC). There are also PDF tutorials. Some tutorials are accompanied by images and blender files, which are most often provided in .zip files (also included here).\n\nI downloaded these from www.tufts.edu before it was taken down (the page it used to be on is a 404 now, it might be due to a restructuring of the website) using Opera's batch download feature. I have not checked all the files myself, though I have encountered at least one PDF that Foxit Reader complains about and is unable to open.\n\nThe uncompressed collection is approximately 490 MB large.\n\nI hope this -- my first torrent actually -- will be of use to some of you!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826f47ff88ef305fd2d3b12ac06c2e94eb09d3d9","amp;dn":"Tufts+Blender+3D+Course+Material","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826f47ff88ef305fd2d3b12ac06c2e94eb09d3d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,111,71,255,136,239,48,95,210,211,177,42,192,108,46,148,235,9,211,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
