Secret Messages \n\nElectric Light Orchestra, commonly abbreviated ELO, were a symphonic rock group from Birmingham, England, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern pop songs with heavily classical overtones, but falling under a light rock category. However, the band's direction for most of their existence was set by Lynne who, after the band's debut record, wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\n\nThe Definitive Collection is a compilation album recorded and produced by Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra. It was released on April 13, 1999.\n\nAll my uploads are ripped by me Abrasax\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f553fcf64d9e1c02a7743d59183d54a815d8ed12","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Definitive+Collection-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f553fcf64d9e1c02a7743d59183d54a815d8ed12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,83,252,246,77,158,28,2,167,116,61,89,24,61,84,168,21,216,237,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
