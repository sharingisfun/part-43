Worth sharing.\n\nTimothy Leary - Turn On Tune In Drop Out\n\nTimothy Leary was an early advocate of LSD experimentation. Leary taught psychology at Harvard and by 1960 was doing experiments with LSD and other hallucinogens, first on prison inmates and then on himself and his friends. LSD was not illegal at the time. In 1960, Allen Ginsberg, supervised by Leary, ingested psilocybin mushrooms, (under the influence of the drug, he phoned Jack Kerouac, identifying himself as God to the telephone operator), and began to spread the word about the new powerful psychedelic drugs. When Harvard dismissed Leary in 1963, he set up the Castalia Institute in Millbrook, New York, to continue his studies. Leary's approach to taking LSD was the opposite of Ken Kesey'sÃƒÆ’Ã‚ï¿½Leary believed in &quot;set and setting,&quot; a practice of taking the drug in a controlled environment, as a safeguard against bad trips. He coined the phrase &quot;Turn On, Tune In, and Drop Out,&quot; and formed the &quot;League of Spiritual Discovery,&quot; an LSD advocacy group. In the mid sixties, he began attending numerous musical events and public forums that promoted the use of LSD. Leary spent a number of years in prison for various charges related to drug possession\n\nFrom the website","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf88f293ac02a194c23372b279c9a81ea3fa48d4","amp;dn":"Dr.+Timothy+Leary-Turn+On%2C+Tune+In%2C+Drop+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf88f293ac02a194c23372b279c9a81ea3fa48d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,136,242,147,172,2,161,148,194,51,114,178,121,201,168,30,163,250,72,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
