The tune was written by Mick Jones and reached number 26 in the U.S. charts where the album, &quot;4&quot;, had already gone to number 1, eventually selling more than six-times platinum.\n\nForeigner are a British-American rock band, originally formed in 1976 by veteran English musicians Mick Jones, ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald along with American vocalist Lou Gramm. Foreigner have sold more than 70 million albums worldwide (including over 37.5 million in the United States alone).\n\nIn June 2011, Foreigner (again along with Styx) will be supporting Journey in their UK tour.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;festival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_It_Up_(Foreigner_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Break_It_Up_(Foreigner_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LaEeJaadI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LaEeJaadI&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:19\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
