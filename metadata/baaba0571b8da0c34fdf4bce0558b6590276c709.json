Lynne has produced recordings for artists such as The Beatles, Roy Orbison, Del Shannon and Tom Petty. He has co-written songs with Petty and also with George Harrison whose 1987 album Cloud Nine was co-produced by Lynne and Harrison. His compositions include &quot;Evil Woman&quot;, &quot;Telephone Line&quot;, &quot;Livin' Thing&quot;, &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Don't Bring Me Down&quot; and &quot;Sweet Talkin' Woman&quot;.\nIn 2008, The Washington Times named Lynne the fourth greatest record producer in music history.\n\nArmchair Theatre is the first solo album by Jeff Lynne, released in 1990.\n&quot;Every little Thing&quot; and &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; were released as singles. The album also features two classic cover versions &quot;September Song&quot; and &quot;Stormy Weather&quot; the latter recorded as a tribute to his late mother. The album re-united Lynne with Electric Light Orchestra's keyboard player Richard Tandy and fellow Traveling Wilburys member George Harrison. Despite positive reviews the album became only a minor hit.\n\nAll my uploads are ripped by me Abrasax\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baaba0571b8da0c34fdf4bce0558b6590276c709","amp;dn":"Jeff+Lynne+-+Armchair+Theater+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baaba0571b8da0c34fdf4bce0558b6590276c709","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,171,160,87,27,141,160,195,79,223,75,206,5,88,182,89,2,118,199,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
