Actually, although Bags is in fine form (and contributed four of the seven selections), he is often overshadowed by rather inspired solos from his sidemen. The first side of Plenty, Plenty Soul, which features a nine-piece group, is highlighted by the contributions of the exuberant altoist Cannonball Adderley, while the flip side has a sextet that is not hurt by the solos of tenor-saxophonist Lucky Thompson. With pianist Horace Silver helping out on both sessions, these all-star dates still sound fresh and enthusiastic decades later.\n\nPersonel : Milt Jackson (vibraphone); Cannonball Adderley (alto saxophone); Frank Foster, Lucky Thompson (tenor saxophone); Sahib Shihab (baritone saxophone); Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Cleveland (trombone); Horace Silver (piano); Percy Heath, Oscar Pettiford (bass); Art Blakey, Connie Kay (drums).\n\nProducer: Nesuhi Ertegun. Reissue producer: Bob Porter. Recorded at Coastal Studios, New York, New York on January 5, 1957 and Capitol Studios, New York, New York on January 7, 1957. Includes liner notes by Nat Hentoff. Digitally remastered by George Piros (Atlantic Studios, New York, New York).\n\n\nTracklist: \n1. Plenty, Plenty Soul\n2. Boogity Boogity\n3. Heartstrings\n4. Sermonette\n5. Spirit-Feel, The\n6.
