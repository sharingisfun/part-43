Includes liner notes!\n\n1973's Inside Straight is one of Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley's last studio recordings - he was dead within two years of its release.  But unlike some recordings made toward the end of a jazz innovator's career, it's as exciting and impassioned as most of the albums that precede it.  Despite a somewhat suite-like structure - the first and last tracks are called &quot;Introduction&quot; and &quot;The End,&quot; and themes recur throughout the eight tracks - this is a relaxed, swinging album.\n\nInside Straight features some outstanding solos, not only from Adderley and his cornetist brother Nat, but also from every member of the quintet.  The title track and &quot;Five of a Kind&quot; are particular highlights of the group's improvisation, but the more structured, Brazilian-tinged &quot;Saudade&quot; is the album's highest point.  This gentle, groove-oriented tune recalls the best work of Antonio Carlos Jobim - no small praise.\n\nPersonnel:\nCannonball Adderley - alto saxophone\nNat Adderley - cornet\nHal Galper - electric piano\nWalter Booker - bass\nRoy McCurdy - drums\nKing Errisson - percussion\n\nCannonball Adderley - Inside Straight Tracks:\n01  Introduction by Bill Hall, KDIA (San Francisco) - 0:19\n02  Inside Straight - 3:19\n03  Saudade - 7:47\n04  Inner Journey - 8:28\n05  SnakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the Grass - 6:24\n06  Five of a Kind - 5:27\n07  Second Son - 6:26\n08  The End - 1:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f5ad6275f168ed3923304909518f937e7110131","amp;dn":"Cannonball+Adderley+-+Inside+Straight+%281973%29+%5Bjazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f5ad6275f168ed3923304909518f937e7110131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,90,214,39,95,22,142,211,146,51,4,144,149,24,249,55,231,17,1,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
