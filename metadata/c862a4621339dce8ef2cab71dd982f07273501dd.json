And on top of that it's using a much newer GRLDR with some bug's fixed\n\nAbout:\nThis application started off as a proof of concept. Everyone at the time I made this was using batch scripts as the back end to their activation techniques and although batch file installation worked it's success rate was poor when compared to my demo application.\n\nThe goal of my program at the time was simple, prove that an application can do everything the batch file can do but in a controlled easy to use way with little to no errors. Not only that though but to show that you can display useful system information and options to the user which a batch file simply can't do.\n\nThis program to this very day is still the only fully coded API driven application that handles it's own errors and depends on itself. It's the original program based loader and it's arguably the best loader based program to get you activated out right now with over 10,000 downloads and counting and a strong fanbase behind it.\n\n\nWhats the goal of this program?\nTo activate you in a clean and simple way without putting a load of buttons and checkboxes on your screen and expecting you to know what to do. It's all about keeping it simple!\n\nWhat makes this different from every other loader out at the moment?\nIt's the only fully coded API based loader application, this means it cuts out the middle man (.NET framework) and can handle everything on it's own. This increases reliability and is considered the professional coder approach.\n\nSo whats the advantages and why should you care?\nWith me building this loader as an application I can access system details and create declares for many of the functions. This means anyone that uses this loader should have a greater chance of success!\n\nWhats the differences between each loader option?\nEach option uses a slightly different method to get you activated, of course the custom menu.lst option should be ignored unless you know what you're doing.\n\nOK so how do I run it?\nIn general you simply press Install!\n\nI activated Windows 7 and now I want to activate Windows Vista, why isn't it working?\nUse the uninstall option while on Windows 7 and reboot into Windows Vista. Next install your selected cert/slic in Windows Vista and then reboot back to Windows 7 and click install.\n\nActivation failed, now what?\nTry again with one of the other loader options, maybe one of them might just work for you.\n\nApplication integrity checking?\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon towards the bottom right of the window to see the information.\n\nI should note that even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around it so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from where you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nChanges since 1.6.9\n\n    * 1.7.0 -- Removed the older loader\n    * 1.7.0 -- Added loader mode options\n    * 1.7.0 -- Changed the UI so that it's now slightly transparent as well as resized to suit the new options\n    * 1.7.0 -- Added Samsung support for Windows 7 Ultimate, Professional &amp; Home Premium editions\n    * 1.7.0 -- Improved internal resources security\n    * 1.7.1 -- Removed window transparency to fix a Windows 7 artifacts bug and improve responsiveness on older systems using onboard graphics\n    * 1.7.1 -- Improved the &quot;Custom menu.lst&quot; loader option.
