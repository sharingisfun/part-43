The tough blues-rockers &quot;You Lie Too Much&quot;, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;, &quot;You're Humbuggin' Me&quot; and &quot;Illustrated Man&quot;, and the catchy old-time rock 'n' roll of &quot;Barefootin'&quot;, are among the highlights, as is the excellent, Elmore James-like slide guitar-workout &quot;If You Got A Good Woman&quot;. Winter also does a good rendition of Jimmy Reed's classic &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot;, and he plays some smouldering electric guitar on &quot;Life Is Hard&quot;. And don't forget the magnificent acoustic blues &quot;Let Me In&quot;, a soulful, Son House-like slide guitar blues. Johnny Winter is by far the best white musician I have ever heard play the acoustic slide guitar...this song brings back memories of his masterful playing on Muddy Waters' &quot;Hard Again&quot; album. There are a couple of minor songs here, but most of &quot;Let Me In&quot; is very solid, making it one of Winter's best latter-day albums. Definitely worth a listen, even if you're not a hardcore fan.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohnny Winter (vocals, guitar); \nBilly Branch (harmonica); \nDr. John (piano);\nKen Saydak (piano);\nJeff Ganz (bass); \nTom Compton (drums).\n\n\nThe WhoMe's Vocal Ensemble: \n\nDennis Drugan, \nMargaret Drugan, \nJohnny Drugan, \nBrian Drugan, \nDave Brickson, \nJohn Gabrysiak, \nDick Shurman.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 Illustrated Man \n02 Barefootin' \n03 Life Is Hard \n04 Hey You \n05 Blue Mood \n06 Sugaree \n07 Medicine Man \n08 You're Humbuggin' Me \n09 If You Got a Good Woman \n10 Got to Find My Baby \n11 Shame, Shame, Shame \n12 Let Me In \n13 You Lie Too Much \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1de87b94b4810298cfe49a1b22ea0f886a7800c6","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter+-+Let+Me+In++%5B1993%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1de87b94b4810298cfe49a1b22ea0f886a7800c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,232,123,148,180,129,2,152,207,228,154,27,34,234,15,136,106,120,0,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
