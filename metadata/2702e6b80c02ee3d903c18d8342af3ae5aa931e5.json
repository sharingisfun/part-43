His father was from the Belgian Congo and his mother was part African American and Cherokee. He was orphaned at the age of 2 and sent to the New Orleans Home for Colored Waifs (also the alma mater of Louis Armstrong).\nHe taught himself piano there and later apprenticed with Tuts Washington and Willie Hall, whom he called his 'father' and from whom he learned &quot;Junker's Blues&quot;. He was also &quot;spy boy&quot; for the Yellow Pochahantas tribe of Mardi Gras Indians and soon began playing in barrelhouses and other drinking establishments.\nAs a young man he began his life of travelling, living in Chicago, where he worked with Georgia Tom, and in Indianapolis, Indiana, where he met Scrapper Blackwell and Leroy Carr. Whilst he was always playing piano, he also worked as a cook, and in Detroit he met Joe Louis, who encouraged him to become a boxer. He ultimately fought in 107 bouts, winning Golden Gloves and other championships and picking up the nickname 'Champion Jack', which he used the rest of his life.[/color][/quote]\n\n\n\nTracklist\n1   I Want to Be a Hippy \n2   Grandma \n3   Puff Puff \n4   Blues Before Sunrise \n5   I'l Try \n6   Going Back to Louisiana \n7   Ain't That a Shame \n8   Stumbling Block \n9   Old and Grey \n10  Who Threw the Whiskey in Well \n11  Postman Blues \n12  Lawdy, Lawdy\n\nPersonel:\nChampion Jack Dupree, voc, piano\n Mick Taylor, guitar; \nRichard Studt, Reg Cole, Barry Wilde, Peter Oxer, violins; \nTerry Noonan, Bud Parks, trumpet, flugelhorn, \nAlan Skidmore, Les Wigfiels, tenor sax\nJim Chester, bass, \nWallace Tring [= Gary Thain], b; \nEduardo Givezano [= Alex Dmochowski], b;\n Mike Vernon, perc; \nHarris Dundee [= Aynsley Dunbar], drums\n Big Chief Drumstick [= Keef Hartley], drums, perc\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2702e6b80c02ee3d903c18d8342af3ae5aa931e5","amp;dn":"Champion+Jack+Dupree+Scooby+Dooby+Doo%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2702e6b80c02ee3d903c18d8342af3ae5aa931e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,2,230,184,12,2,238,61,144,60,24,216,52,42,243,174,90,169,49,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
