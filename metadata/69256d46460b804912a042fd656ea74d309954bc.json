I have scanned the cover which is the same for\nfront and back of the box and this is contained in the first disc torrent. I have omitted the 80 page\nbook that is included with the set because it would take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad\nenough then buy the box set. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the\nexception Ten Years After.\n\nPease note that some of these tracks were unissued and some are complete and original versions that\nwere unissued. Some of the tracks on the movie soundtrack are not original. Some of the bands that\nplayed Woodstock refused to allow their music to be included in the collection. I hope in the future\nthese groups will issue their own Woodstock Experience album.\n\n\nThe Woodstock Project torrent is a collection of all the released original material as well as bootleg material but it has not been\nupdated as best as I can tell. In my spare time, I will try to update the set with the new material and\nput it in proper chronological order.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.\n\nPlease help seed these torrents.
