She was commercially active from 1980 to 1990, 2000 to 2001 and is active again from 2007 to present.[1] She was initially the vocalist for a band named Luba before signing as a solo artist under the one-name moniker. She has released a total of six albums as a solo artist. (A pre-solo album released under the name Luba was done as a member of a band.) Two of her albums are certified platinum by the Canadian music industry (sales in excess of 100,000 units). She has nine top-40 hits on the Canadian pop charts. Her signature song is &quot;Everytime I See Your Picture&quot; (1983). Her most successful song is a cover of Percy Sledge's &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; which reached #6 on the Canadian pop chart and #3 on the Canadian adult contemporary chart (1987). She is a three-time winner of the Canadian music industry Juno Award for Female Vocalist of the Year (1985ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1987). Her success is limited to her native Canada as she has never charted in the US or elsewhere. She continues to record music under her own independent label.\n\nLuba Kowalchyk was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 1958 to Ukrainian immigrant parents. Growing up she studied piano, guitar, flute and voice. During her teens she traveled across Canada to perform traditional Ukrainian folk songs at weddings and festivals.\n\nIn 1978 she formed a band under her first name Luba. Their debut album Chain Reaction was released on an independent label and received only minimal interest outside of their native Montreal.\n\nLuba enjoyed her greatest success in Canada between 1983 and 1987. Capitol-EMI of Canada signed Luba Kowalchyk as a solo artist under the one name moniker Luba in 1982. A self-titled EP followed in late 1982 and the top 40 hit &quot;Everytime I See Your Picture&quot; in early 1983. In 1984 Luba released her first full-length album called Secrets And Sins. It issued the singles &quot;Let It Go&quot; and &quot;Storm Before The Calm&quot; both reaching the Canadian top-40 charts. Luba earned her first Canadian music industry Juno Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1985. Later the same year, she recorded several songs written by Stephen Lunt, Jon Stroll and Kevin Gillis for the first season of the Canadian cartoon series The Raccoons. Several of these songs were later re-recorded by Lisa Lougheed for use in later seasons. Two of LubaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs are featured on the 1986 movie soundtrack 9 1/2 Weeks starring Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke. Let It Go from her Secrets and Sins album and one not previously released by Luba, The Best is Yet to Come. In 1986 Luba released Between The Earth &amp; Sky, which included the single &quot;How Many (Rivers To Cross)&quot;. This top 20 Canadian hit had represented Canada at the 1985 World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan and made the finals. Also in 1986, Luba won her second straight Juno as Canada's best female vocalist. Shortly after the album release, Luba's band was involved in a serious bus accident, although Luba herself was not on board the bus at the time. Luba and her band took some time off, returning in 1987 with Over 60 Minutes With Luba, a compilation of her hits with one new track, a live recording of &quot;When A Man Loves A Woman&quot;. This track would become her biggest Canadian hit, peaking at #6 on the RPM top 100. She would cap the year with her third straight &quot;Best Female Vocalist&quot; Juno.\n\nBy 1988 Luba still had not broken into the US market despite all her success at home the previous 5 years. Her label decided changes were needed and new management was brought in. Her next album, All Or Nothing, was recorded over a year and half across 7 studios using more than a dozen session musicians. Released in the fall of 1989, the album included the singles &quot;Giving Away A Miracle,&quot; &quot;No More Words&quot;, and &quot;Little Salvation&quot;. The band recorded an acoustic, live-in-the-studio show in Toronto and released as Live on Tour in 1990. Although All Or Nothing reached platinum status in Canada, it did nothing in the US. Her label then dropped her before the end of the year.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Luba experienced both professional and personal issues that resulted in her withdrawing from the music industry. In 1990, her marriage to band drummer and manager Peter Marunzak ended in divorce. Following her release from Capitol Records, she struggled to land a contract with another major record label. Her grandmother and then her mother both died. Finally, her sister, and lone relative left in Canada, developed multiple sclerosis that required intensive care. Finally, Luba felt she was missing out on a &quot;regular&quot; life from years of long hours in the music industry. Altogether, Luba decided to put her career on hold and focus on other priorities.\n\nThe latest album by Luba, From The Bitter To The Sweet, was released in 2000 on her own label Azure Music. While the album won some critical acclaim, and produced the Top 30 single &quot;Is She A Lot Like Me?&quot;, it did not match the sales or radio airplay as her earlier albums. At year's end, she was featured in a concert performance on a Canadian program entitled An Evening With The Stars, which included both new and old material.\n\nIn addition to her Juno Awards, Luba has also received CASBY and FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lix Awards, and a Black Music Association Award for &quot;Female Entertainer of the Year&quot;. Most recently, her music has been featured on Canadian Idol.\n\nTwo new songs by Luba have recently appeared on a member music page of the popular social networking site MySpace. One is a ballad called &quot;Heaven,&quot; and the other more upbeat called &quot;Time.&quot; These are possibly singles for an upcoming album release, which is mentioned on both this Luba MySpace page and Luba's official website. An April 18, 2007 update on Luba's official website states that Luba chose to use MySpace in order to connect with her fans as well as for posting her music. Additional information is included on there, as well as a link to her MySpace page. Both new singles are available for adding to other MySpace members' music profiles.\n\nLuba has recently moved from Canada as of mid-2007 and now lives in the Caribbean Islands. She is still very focused on her passion, writing and singing, and is working on a new album which will highlight her roots in Soul/R&amp;B music. As well, she is pursuing another passion in the way of photography. Her work has already garnered tremendous critical acclaim, due to her distinct compositional style and innovative approach. Luba is also closely involved with animal causes, working with various animal shelters in providing service dogs to people suffering from physical and psychological trauma.\n\nLuba remains one of the more successful female artists in Canadian music history despite never charting in the US. Her 3 consecutive Juno awards for Female Vocalist of the Year puts her in select company. Only Anne Murray (9) and Celine Dion (6) have more. What sets Luba apart from Murray and Dion is that she principally writes her own material. She is regarded as one of Canada's most successful singer-songwriters to date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChain Reaction 1980\n\n\nChain Reaction is the only album by canadian band Luba featuring Luba Kowalchyk as vocalist. It was produced by Tony Green for his own label. The album contains songs in the early New Wave music style. It was made available on compact disc in 1996.\n\nNote that initially Luba was the name of the band and not Luba Kowalchyk's stage name. In 1982, Luba Kowalchyk was signed by Capitol Records as the artist Luba and the remaining members served as her backup band.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tChain Reaction ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n2.\tRunaround ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n3.\tI Stand Alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n4.\tHeaven In Your Eyes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n5.\tStay - 5:03\n6.\tHave A Heart - 3:29\n7.\tLovers In The Night - 3:42\n8.\tSeems Like A Dream - 6:04\n9.\tBlack &amp; White - 3:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween the Earth &amp; Sky 1986\n\n\nBetween the Earth &amp; Sky is a follow-up release to the breakout album Secrets And Sins by Canadian singer, Luba and band. A powerful and emotional album which helped her win a second Juno Award for &quot;Female Vocalist of the Year.&quot; It was also her first album to go platinum in Canada. Various musical artists appear on Between the Earth &amp; Sky, including a saxophone solo by jazz musician Kenny G on the hit single &quot;How Many&quot; (produced by Narada Michael Walden). Other popular singles on the album include &quot;Strength In Numbers,&quot; &quot;Act of Mercy&quot; and &quot;Innocent (With an Explanation).&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n2.\t&quot;How Many&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n3.\t&quot;What You Believe&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n4.\t&quot;Even in the Darkest Moments&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n5.\t&quot;Back to Emotion&quot; - 4:09\n6.\t&quot;Act of Mercy&quot; - 5:29\n7.\t&quot;Innocent (With an Explanation)&quot; - 3:41\n8.\t&quot;Take It Like a Woman&quot; - 4:35\n9.\t&quot;Lay Down Your Love&quot; - 4:23\n10.\t&quot;Between the Earth and Sky&quot; - 4:41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 60 Minutes with Luba 1987\n\n\nOver 60 Minutes With Luba is a compilation of popular songs from the first three albums on Capitol-EMI of Canada by Canadian singer, Luba and band. Two additional songs appear on this release, including the hit single &quot;The Best Is Yet To Come&quot; which is featured on the motion picture soundtrack for 9Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ Weeks and a live version of the Percy Sledge classic &quot;When A Man Loves A Woman.&quot; A 12&quot; club mix of the Canadian gold smash &quot;Let It Go&quot; is also included on this album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\tThe Best Is Yet To Come ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54 (from the soundtrack 9Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ Weeks, 1986)\n2.\tWhen A Man Loves A Woman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 (previously unreleased)\n3.\tLet It Go [Extended Club Mix] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11 (previously unreleased)\n4.\tInnocent (With An Explanation) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n5.\tAct Of Mercy - 5:31 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n6.\tSecrets And Sins - 3:41 (from Secrets And Sins, 1984)\n7.\tEven In The Darkest Moments - 3:52 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n8.\tHow Many - 4:14 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n9.\tSacrificial Heart - 3:31 (from Secrets And Sins, 1984)\n10.\tStorm Before The Calm - 3:28 (from Secrets And Sins, 1984)\n11.\tEverytime I See Your Picture - 4:01 (from Secrets And Sins, 1984)\n12.\tStrength In Numbers - 4:29 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n13.\tWhat You Believe - 4:26 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n14.\tRaven's Eyes - 3:22 (from Luba (EP), 1982)\n15.\tBack To Emotion - 4:07 (from Between The Earth &amp; Sky, 1986)\n16.\tResurrect The Love - 4:24 (from Secrets And Sins, 1984)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Bitter To The Sweet 2000\n\n\nFrom The Bitter To The Sweet is the latest release by Canadian singer, Luba. A primarily solo work on her own label and her first in more than a decade, it did not produce as much sales or radio airplay as her previous albums.
