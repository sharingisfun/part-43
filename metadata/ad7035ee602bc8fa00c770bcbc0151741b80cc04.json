We understand that\nthey are the only artists here doing this\novertly, although we have been told that there\nare others working for them covertly, and yet\nstill more whose minds have been programmed by\nthe masters and are doing their bidding without\neven being aware of it. They came from the\nstars, i saw them have ebbed and flowed along\ntheir merry stream since 1999 in all manner of\nincarnations from the sublime to the ridiculous,\nand are currently honed down to a 4-piece rock\nand rock outfit. The album is a glorious mash up\nstyles and you can hear hot chip, !!!, the\nrapture, exotica, 80's pop and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad7035ee602bc8fa00c770bcbc0151741b80cc04","amp;dn":"They+Came+From+The+Stars+I+Saw+Them+-+We+are+all+in+the+gutter%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad7035ee602bc8fa00c770bcbc0151741b80cc04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,112,53,238,96,43,200,250,0,199,112,188,188,1,81,116,27,128,204,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
