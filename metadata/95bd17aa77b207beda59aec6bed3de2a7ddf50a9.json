Most of '21' was produced by Rick Rubin, who has worked with some of the biggest acts of the last 20 years, and Florence &amp; The Machine producer Paul Epworth. Lyrically the album reflects Adele's increased maturity since '19', although it explores many of the same themes. \n\nTrack Listings\n1. Rolling In The Deep  \n2. Rumour Has It  \n3.

I re-encoded them because ipod doesnt support FLAC and the file sizes are rather large. \n\nDownload and check out the quality. You wont be able to tell the difference between these and the originals unless you're a serious audiophile.\n \nEnjoy!!
