Three of the four singles from the album went to number one in the United Kingdom, while the debut single made number two. The album was a commercial success and actually sold better than Forever, the Spice Girls album that was released after Halliwell's departure from the group.\nThe album debuted at no.4 in the United Kingdom, selling 31,274 in its first week, and 483,419 in total, being certified 2x Platinum for shipments of 600,000 copies.\nIn the United States, the album faced medium success, selling 40,000 copies in its first week debuting and peaking at no.42 on the Billboard Hot 200 (still the strongest Spice Girls solo showing on the chart). Eventually, the album was certified Gold in 2001 with shipments of 500,000 copies.\n\nSchizophonic was released with 2 different covers, representing an angel (white), and a devil (red); both covers are the same edition of the album. On the first O on Schizophonic there is an angel halo on the white cover and horns on the red cover. On the back cover, the song titles are written on both red and white, relating the theme of the song to one of the personalities. The booklet of the album features both covers on all editions, and the lyrics of the songs are included on the side that they are marked on the back cover.\nTrack Listings\n\n\n[01] Look At Me\n[02] Lift Me Up\n[03] Walkaway\n[04] Mi Chico Latino\n[05] Goodnight Kiss\n[06] Bag It Up\n[07] Sometime\n[08] Let Me Love You\n[09] Someone's Watching Over Me\n[10] You're In Trouble\n\n\n\n \nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:40m:52s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 99.2mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v7.5.0.20 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 07 June 1999\n\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook At Me - Geri Halliwell [1999]\n\n\n\t\nLook at Me&quot; was released as the first single from Geri HalliwellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut solo album Schizophonic.\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Look At Me\n[02] Look At Me [Mark!s Big Vocal Mix Surgery Edit]\n[03] Look At Me (Terminalhead Remix)\n\n\nMusic Video\n\n[01] Look At Me [122mb]\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:19m:39s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 168mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- Mpeg\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginally Released\t- 10 May 1999\n\nRecord Company\t\t- EMI Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.gerihalliwellofficial.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c436e02d05ecebb77334c061a07ab24511ecb9","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Schizophonic+-+Geri+Halliwell+-+98.3mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c436e02d05ecebb77334c061a07ab24511ecb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,196,54,224,45,5,236,235,183,115,52,192,97,160,122,178,69,17,236,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
