Now spectacular footage reveals another side to this hunters killing power.\n\nWe follow a family of lion cubs as they start out in life. Seven out of the eight cubs are male - for them the clock is ticking, within two years they need to learn to hunt before setting out and finding new territories of their own, to avoid treading on the toes of the dominant pride male.\n\nThe cubs hunting lessons are perhaps not what you might expect; instead of ambushing their prey and quickly despatching with a clean bite to the throat, these lions wrestle their victim to the ground and tuck in before the hapless beast is dead. When the prey is a young elephant, it means a slow and painful death. Are these lions behaving badly or is it simply that this is what lions do?\n\nSCREEN SHOTS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.g4vault.com/images/w6b3ctwhe7aapd8unqh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.g4vault.com/images/w6b3ctwhe7aapd8unqh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://www.g4vault.com/images/o7tghi53dfcwzy5qp5vh.jpg\nhttp://www.g4vault.com/images/jmm9z3ekea54e29ok8hl.jpg\nhttp://www.g4vault.com/images/sa7ybd08d20h7b3joi42.jpg\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9829c285f9a4a8bed45d6fea344e459185170524","amp;dn":"Lions+Behaving+Badly.%28NAT+GEO+WILD%29.july2009-With+Arabic+Sub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9829c285f9a4a8bed45d6fea344e459185170524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,41,194,133,249,164,168,190,212,93,111,234,52,78,69,145,133,23,5,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
