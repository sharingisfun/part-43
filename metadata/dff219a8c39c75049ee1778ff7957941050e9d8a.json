It was originally released in both mono and stereo versions as Atco (SD) 33-200, but when the single &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; became a hit, the album was re-released as Atco (SD) 33-200A and added &quot;For What It's Worth&quot;, but dropped &quot;Baby Don't Scold Me&quot;. &quot;Baby Don't Scold Me&quot; has never been reissued in stereo:. The band was generally unhappy with the sound of the album and felt that it didn't reflect the intensity of their live shows.\n\nTracklist\n1 - Go And Say Goodbye (Mono) \n[i]Recorded July 18, 1966, Gold Star Studios, Los Angeles, California.
