It was announced in March 2007 by Clive Davis (head of Arista Records), that the singer would be recording the album. \n\nThe album will be a mixture of R&amp;B, big ballads, and dance music. According to Davis, the album is aiming not to simply follow current music marketing trends, but instead, stay true to who Houston is and the impact she has made on the music industry. The roster of producers and writers include Swizz Beatz, Johnta Austin, Alicia Keys, R. Kelly, Harvey Mason, Jr., and Akon, who is the only guest vocalist on the album.\n\nHouston's performance on Good Morning America's 'Fall Concerts' series on the American television broadcast network ABC aired on September 02, 2009. She performed songs from this album, including single &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; and title song &quot;I Look to You&quot;, as well as previous hits &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;.\n\n1. \t&quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot;   \tAlicia Keys, Kasseem Dean, Norman Harris \tKaseem &quot;Swizz Beatz&quot; Dean, Alicia Keys \t3:24\n2. \t&quot;Nothin' But Love&quot;   \tFranne Golde, Fernando Garibay, Kasia Livingston, Nathaniel Hills \tNathaniel &quot;Danja&quot; Hills, Fernando Garibay \t3:35\n3. \t&quot;Call You Tonight&quot;   \tTor Erik Hermansen, Mikkel S.
