Born with a lazy eye, for which she wore a patch while growing up, she became a loner oddball whose only friend was a perfectly kept doll. She moves to L.A. and takes up with a filmmaker (Jeremy Sisto), but the relationship sours quickly -- and dangerously. She then befriends an alluring lesbian colleague (Anna Faris), but that, too, along with every connection May attempts to make, turns deadly. \nLength:\n93 minutes\nDirector:\nLucky McKee\n\nCast:\nAngela Bettis Jeremy Sisto\nAnna Faris James Duval\nNichole Hiltz Kevin Gage\nMerle Kennedy Chandler Hecht\nJennifer Grant Roxanne Day\nWill Estes\n\nLanguage and Sound:\nEnglish\nOriginal Release Date:\n2003\n\nReally nice movie from jdpennington!
