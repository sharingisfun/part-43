It was released as the album's second official single in October, 2009.\n\nA viral music video directed by Adria Petty was released, prior to the albums release, on May 29, 2009. Filming of the music video took place in east Lancaster, California down the street from Club Ed, a film studio located in the Antelope Valley that is used for various TV shows, motion pictures, and TV commericals for several decades.\n\nSpektor performed this song along with &quot;The Calculation&quot; on Saturday Night Live on October 10, 2009.\n\nFar is the fifth studio album by American alternative singer-songwriter Regina Spektor, released in Europe through Sire Records on June 22, 2009 and North America on June 23, 2009 The album's first single, &quot;Laughing With&quot;, was uploaded to Spektor's MySpace page on May 8 and was released as a digital download on May 18 in the United States and parts of Europe, along with the b-side &quot;Blue Lips&quot;.

The official music video for &quot;Laughing With&quot; was released on iTunes on May 26, 2009. A special edition of the album was released with two bonus tracks and a DVD, which included four music videos.\n\nSpektor decided to work with multiple producers on the album. She says she thinks of creating an album like a class so she wanted to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“multiple professorsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. She also felt the multiple producers would allow them not to worry what the single or big hit would be. The most notable producers include David Kahne, who produced her last album Begin To Hope and Jeff Lynne, former member of ELO and The Traveling Wilburys. Although Lynne has an expansive musical background, Spektor did not know of his work when she originally met him.\n\nFar entered the official UK Albums Chart at number 30 It also sold 50,000 copies in its first week, entering the US Billboard 200 number three. In the Canadian Albums Chart, Far debuted at number 16. The album has spent nineteen weeks on the Billboard 200, and currently sits at #198.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88a1f4496007f06fff009b80d33d323566bfbe5c","amp;dn":"Regina+Spektor+-+EET+++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88a1f4496007f06fff009b80d33d323566bfbe5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,161,244,73,96,7,240,111,255,0,155,128,211,61,50,53,102,191,190,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
