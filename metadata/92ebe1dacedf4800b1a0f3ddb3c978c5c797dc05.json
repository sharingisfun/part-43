A top shelf and incredibly versatile guitarist, Spedding has a formidable resume as a session player, having appeared on literally hundreds of sessions, ranging from his work with Brian Ferry and John Cale to his mid-seventies appearance as one of the Wombles! Having been part of the excellent but criminally overlooked British band The Sharks in the early seventies, Spedding released a fine trilogy of solo albums in the mid to late seventies -&quot;Chris Spedding&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot; and &quot;Guitar Graffiti&quot;. &quot;Hurt&quot; is the best of the lot. \n\nFeaturing his own idiosyncratic, often humourous originals and somewhat deadpan vocals, along with a well chosen cover or two, &quot;Hurt&quot; sees Spedding trawl through a variety of styles - RnB, rock and roll, countryish rock and his unique take on punk/new wave, the latter typified by the irresistable &quot;Get Outa My Pagoda&quot;, the bonus track &quot;Pogo Dancing&quot; (a UK single)and the stunning title track. Throughout, Spedding's guitar sparkles - he's a true original, his solos inevitably spot on and concise. His playing at the conclusion of &quot;Hurt by Love&quot; provides a great example of his style. \n\nSpedding is still active today, and still recording high quality records, but &quot;Hurt&quot; is Chris Spedding at his best. \n\nThis re-issue features four bonus tracks, all of which sit nicely with the original ten song album. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nChris Spedding (vocals, guitar); \nChrissie Hynde, Neil Lancaster, Charles Mills, John Carter (vocals); \nJack Emblow (musette); \nHarold Fisher, Clem Cattini (drums); \nRay Cooper (percussion);\nHerbie Flowers (bass).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
