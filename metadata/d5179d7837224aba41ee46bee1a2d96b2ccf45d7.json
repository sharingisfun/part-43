All life on Earth needs water so the search for aliens in the solar system has followed the search for water. Soaring above the dramatic Scablands of the United States, Brian discovers how the same landscape has been found on Mars. And it was all carved out in a geological heartbeat by a monumental flood. Armed with a gas mask, Brian enters a cave in Mexico where bacteria breathe toxic gas and leak concentrated acid. Yet relatives of these creatures could be surviving in newly-discovered caves on Mars. But Brian's sixth wonder isn't a planet at all. Jupiter's moon Europa is a dazzling ball of ice etched with strange cracks. The patterns in the ice reveal that, far below, there is an ocean with more potentially life-giving water than all the oceans on Earth. Of all the wonders of the solar system forged by the laws of nature, there is one that stands out. In the final episode of this series, Brian reveals the greatest wonder of them all.\n\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 9256 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1:777\nVideo Resolution: 1440x1080 displayed at 1920x1080\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 384 Kb/s 48000Hz\nAudio Channels: 6\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 50FPS\nNumber of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 3.87 GB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: DVB-S\n\nThis is the original 1080 PAFF TS file wrapped inside a MKV container.\nYou'll also find the PDTV Xvid and 720p HDTV versions at MVGroup.\nThese have been tested with VLC v1.0.5 and MPC-HC 1.3.1301.0 and FFDShow and Haali.\nIf you use FFDShow make sure you use the ffmpeg-mt h264 codec, not the default libavcodec codec.\nIf you use FFDShow libavcodec codec then one processor thread runs at 100%, the other runs at 0% causing jerky video.\nThe ffmpeg-mt h264 codec balances out the CPU thread usage.\n\nRelease schedule for 1080:\nPart 1: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5491759\nPart 2: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5494870\nPart 3: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5497916\nPart 4: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5501480\nPart 5: This is it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5179d7837224aba41ee46bee1a2d96b2ccf45d7","amp;dn":"BBC+Wonders+of+the+Solar+System+5of5+1080i+HDTV+h264+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5179d7837224aba41ee46bee1a2d96b2ccf45d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,23,157,120,55,34,74,186,65,238,70,190,225,162,217,107,44,207,69,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
