Vocalist Chris Norman, bassist Terry Utley, and guitarist Alan Silson had played in the Elizabethans, but formed the band Kindness in 1968, with the addition of drummer Pete Spencer. The quartet recorded many singles during the late '60s and early '70s, but failed to show any chart activity until 1975. That year, signed to Rak Records and billed as Smokey, the band hit number three in the U.K. with &quot;If You Think You Know How to Love Me.&quot; After another Top Ten hit, &quot;Don't Play Your Rock 'n' Roll to Me,&quot; Smokey became Smokie; during 1976, the group scored with three Top 20 hits, including the number five &quot;Living Next Door to Alice.&quot; Smokie hit number five both in 1977 (&quot;It's Your Life&quot;) and 1978 (&quot;Oh Carol&quot;), but the band's chart run ended by early 1980, and following 1982's Midnight Delight, they disbanded. Both Spencer and Norman continued to work at Rak during the '80s, writing hits for several groups; they re-formed Smokie in 1988, resurfacing with the LP My Heart Is True. Two more albums, All Fired Up and Greatest Hits Live, followed, with the group remaining active throughout the 1990s, issuing new material as well as a number of hits collections.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Living Next Door To Alice\n02.Something's Been Making Me Blue\n03.It's Your Life\n04.If You Think You Know How To Love Me\n05.Mexican Girl\n06.For A Few Dollars More\n07.Don't Play Your Rock 'N' Roll To Me\n08.Needles And Pins\n09.Oh Carol\n10.I'll Meet You At Midnight\n11.Take Good Care Of My Baby\n12.When A Man Loves A Woman\n13.Alice, Who The Fuck Is Alice\n14.Alice, Who The Fuck Is Alice (Techno Version)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd7877c1c5004342841a9ae1e6e9acab4461768","amp;dn":"Smokie+-+Their+Greatest+Hits+%281995%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cd7877c1c5004342841a9ae1e6e9acab4461768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,215,135,124,28,80,4,52,40,65,169,174,30,110,154,202,180,70,23,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
