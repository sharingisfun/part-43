In spite of the fact that the audio balance is somewhat inconsistent, the playing by everyone is exemplary throughout both sessions. \n\n\nWebster, whose performances sometimes suffered from his bouts of heavy drinking, seems particularly stimulated by the driving piano of John Lewis and bluesy vibes of Milt Jackson. In addition to the swing standards for which the tenor saxophonist was well known, he tackles Charlie Parker's &quot;Confirmation&quot; and &quot;Billie's Bounce&quot; with equal enthusiasm. \n\n\nOther selections include ballad features such as &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;The Nearness of You,&quot; the latter showcasing Webster's rich, big tone. Romps through &quot;Oh Lady Be Good&quot; and &quot;Cotton Tail&quot; (one of many recordings of this Duke Ellington masterpiece that is forever associated with Webster) are a delight. \n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n\n\n01 Confirmation (Parker) 5:27\n02 You Are Too Beautiful (Hart, Rodgers) 3:51\n03 Oh Lady Be Good (Gershwin, Gershwin) 5:25\n04 The Nearness of You (Carmichael, Washington) 5:38\n05 Poutin' (Webster) 4:57\n06 Danny Boy (Weatherly) 4:37\n07 Billie's Bounce (Parker) 4:27\n08 Cotton Tail (Ellington) 5:39\n\n\n\n\nBroadcast from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBirdlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, New York on February 21 (1-5) and 28(6-8), 1953\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBen Webster: tenor sax\nMilt Jackson: vibraphone\nJohn Lewis: piano\nPercy Heath: bass\nKenny Clarke: drums\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206feae7bd0cb7d1a57fa893537a87af2242aab1","amp;dn":"Ben+Webster+%26+The+MJQ+-+An+Exceptional+Encounter++%281953%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206feae7bd0cb7d1a57fa893537a87af2242aab1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,111,234,231,189,12,183,209,165,127,168,147,83,122,135,175,34,66,170,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
