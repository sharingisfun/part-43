All the other files inside are the original ones, not patched, so you should not have any problem with Antiviruses.\n\nIf you don't trust it, download the original Setup from RarLabs Site and copy the RarReg.key file in the install Dir (usually C:Program FilesWinRAR), or use the included KeyGen to Register it.\n\n\n\nWinRAR - What's new in the latest version\n\n\n   Version 3.91 beta 2\n\n   1.

If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab28da07c1b25f96174693777011625e851a2f2d","amp;dn":"WinRAR+3.91+b2+x86-x64+PreRegged+%28Corporate%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab28da07c1b25f96174693777011625e851a2f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,40,218,7,193,178,95,150,23,70,147,119,112,17,98,94,133,26,47,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
