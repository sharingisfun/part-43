In Essex,\n      single mum Jane Edwards and her two youngest children - Grant,\n      11, and Mia, 15 - care for the oldest child in the family,\n      18-year-old Levi, who has Asperger's Syndrome. Mia and Grant\n      shoulder a lot of the responsibility for caring for him, and, as\n      Jane points out, are missing out on much of their own childhood\n      as a result. They are sponsored by the Russells, a wealthy\n      family living in Sussex. Scott is a self-made millionaire,\n      married to Linzi. They have three children - Henry, 10, Max,\n      eight, and Oliver, who's six months old. Can the Russells help\n      get the Edwards back on their feet? And how do the children get\n      on, when they come from such very different backgrounds?\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n                                                      \n      Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED and NO .US!                       \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      If you're a P2P retard don't even bother emailing us, because \n       we WILL hurl abuse at you.
