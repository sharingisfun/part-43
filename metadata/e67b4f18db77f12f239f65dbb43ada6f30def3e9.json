Lucentio (Michael York), a student and the son of a wealthy Pisan merchant, has fallen in love with Bianca. He poses as a tutor of music and poetry to gain entrance to the Baptista household and to be near Bianca. Meanwhile, Petruchio (Richard Burton), a fortune-hunting scoundrel from Verona, arrives in Padua, hoping to capture a wealthy wife. Hortensio (Victor Spinetti), another suitor of Bianca, directs Petruchio's attention to Katharina. When Hortensio warns him about Katharina's scolding tongue and fiery temper, Petruchio is challenged and resolves to capture her love. Hortensio and another suitor of Bianca, Gremio (Cyril Cusack), agree to cover Petruchio's costs as he pursues Katharina.\n\nAudio: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish.\nSubs.: English, French, German, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Hindi, Turkish, Danish,\n       Arabic, Bulgarian, Swedish, Finnish, Icelandic, Dutch, Norwegian, Portuguese\n       Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian.\n\nPlease seed After downloading..THANKS &amp; ENJOY..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e67b4f18db77f12f239f65dbb43ada6f30def3e9","amp;dn":"The+Taming+of+the+Shrew+%281967%29+DVD-R.PAL.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e67b4f18db77f12f239f65dbb43ada6f30def3e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,123,79,24,219,119,241,47,35,159,101,219,180,58,218,111,48,222,243,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
