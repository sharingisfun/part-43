Teaching is just to remind you; you must take the call.&quot; - Sadhguru\n\nGuru - The Inner Awakening points out the wisdom of moving away from a life of stagnation by allowing oneself to becoming vulnerable and receptive to the Guru.\n\nSadhguru speaks on the significance of Guru Poornima followed by a question and answer session with the meditators where he answers the following questions:\n\nQuestion 1: Sadhguru you have talked of how a seed has to go through the pain of losing its safety, it's shield, how it has to become vulnerable in order to sprout. Until the sprouting happens do seekers have to live their lives in increased states of fragility and vulnerability? Isn't that particularly hard on them?\n\nQuestion 2: Sadhguru you have said, transmission is more important than teaching. Teaching is only a way of knocking on the door. Could you say more about this?\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9591a70858ad537b4da06de3f901a02ad70a9a47","amp;dn":"Guru+-+The+Inner+Awakening+--+Sadhguru+Jaggi+Vasudev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9591a70858ad537b4da06de3f901a02ad70a9a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,145,167,8,88,173,83,123,77,160,109,227,249,1,160,42,215,10,154,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
