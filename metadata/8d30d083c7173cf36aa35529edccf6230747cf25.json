He was born as Nicholas Agamalis and his career in dance music started in the early 1990s.\n\nSince 1996, his Skitzmix series of compilations have become well-known in Australian dance circles for featuring remixes and megamixes of wellknown dance songs and are the best selling DJ compilations in Australia. In late 2001, Skitzmix 10 even reached #9 on the mainstream ARIA Albums Chart alongside artists like Creed, Shaggy and the Bridget Jones' Diary Soundtrack. Skitz has also featured on Ministry of Sound &amp; Wild compilations.\n\nSkitz's track &quot;The Ultimate&quot; has reached #2 on the dance charts in the UK. His first pop hit &quot;Slave to the Music&quot; reached the top 20 in Australia in November 2003 and was a cover of an original song by Twenty 4 Seven.\n\nIn 2004, he joined forces with Mark Gable, lead singer of Australian rock band The Choirboys to rework their 1987 Australian hit &quot;Run to Paradise&quot; as a dance track. The song, billed as &quot;Nick Skitz vs. the Choirboys&quot;, debuted in the top 20 of the Australian pop charts in July 2004. The single also features a remix by Jason Nevins.\n\nSince 2006, Skitz has released 2 rock compilations called SkitzMetal and SkitzRocks featuring 80s and 90s rock originals like Quiet Riot's &quot;Cum On Feel The Noize&quot; and Scorpion's &quot;Wind Of Change&quot; and some dance remakes of glam rock hits. In July 2007, Skitz released a rock/dance version of David Lee Roth's 80s hit &quot;Just Like Paradise&quot;. It reached #58 on the ARIA Physical Sales Chart in Australia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d30d083c7173cf36aa35529edccf6230747cf25","amp;dn":"SkitzMix+32+%5B2009%5D+CD+Rip+320Kbps+%5BCov%2BCD%5D+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d30d083c7173cf36aa35529edccf6230747cf25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,48,208,131,199,23,60,243,106,163,85,41,237,204,246,35,7,71,207,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
