He publicly humiliates the president, while friends broadcast his message to the nation.  That message: &quot;You are being lied to and controlled by a secret alliance of political and corporate masters.  Now I'm going to expose them&quot;.  The government sends out the superhuman team of Enola Gay to kill The American.  Although they may not have to . . .\n\n\nThe series, written by Rob Williams with art by Trevor Hairsine, was due to be launched in November 2001, but had to be delayed because of the 9/11 attacks.  The first three issues were finally published between January and July 2002 and were collected into a trade paperback in 2003.  When the publisher came back from a hiatus caused by problems including a serious burglary, Hairsine had already moved on to Marvel and, while Cary Nord was initially pencilled in as his replacement, a job that finally went to Travel Foreman and the last three issue were published between March and June 2004.  Len O'Grady provided all the colouring to &quot;maintain colour continuity&quot;.  \n\nAlthough people make the link with The Authority, Williams has said he had not read the series before starting to write Cla$$war and he went on to explain the actual inspiration:\n\n&quot;Cla$$war was influenced by my love of people like Noam Chomsky - I was reading his Class Warfare when I came up with the idea for the series - and Bill Hicks, my fascination with Nixon and American politics in general.  I spend half my time reading books on subjects like the CIA, biographies of people like Martin Luther King.  For some reason IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m captivated by US history over the past 50 year... I also love intelligent superhero comics - a legacy from my dysfunctional youth and the effect Alan MooreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Captain Britain and Marvelman had on me in the early eighties. So I figured IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d combine the two&quot;.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6cbb3588f069bba846ef04e34adf4a2f43ff783","amp;dn":"Classwar+%28Cla%24%24war%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6cbb3588f069bba846ef04e34adf4a2f43ff783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,203,179,88,143,6,155,186,132,110,240,78,52,173,244,162,244,63,247,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
