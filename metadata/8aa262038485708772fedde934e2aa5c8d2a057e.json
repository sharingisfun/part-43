As well all know that Intel Atom is not supported by the new kernel. Well, let's wait when http://opensource.apple.com will source xnu. While there is no source, I made a patch for mach_kernel 10.2.0. This &quot;dirty bithack&quot;, so claims are not accepted. The patch is designed exclusively for Atom-based netbook!\n\nI do not update the working system to version 10.6.2, all the field tests carried out on what was at hand, namely, the unfolded stick to Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server. The installer is loaded with a patched kernel. \nIf someone uses the kernel and updated from previous versions of Mac OS, test the given kernel and otpishites in the comments, I'll be very grateful. \n\nYes, patches are only 32-bit piece.\n\nShows atom as Core 2 Solo.\n\nteateam blogspot com\n\nalso see macrumors nov 20 9:19 EST post titled &quot;Workaround Restores Mac OS X 10.6.2 Compatibility With Intel Atom Processors&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faEkOAacp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faEkOAacp&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAekPAACP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAekPAACP&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nINSTALL BY:\n1.
