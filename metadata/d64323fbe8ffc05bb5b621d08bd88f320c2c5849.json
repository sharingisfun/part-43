To be honest, I havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t got a bad word to say about WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That Flying. The game played like a dream, it was fluid, easy to get into, playable, chaotic and impossibly infuriatingly FUN! IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve played side scroller shoot-em-upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s since I killed my Spectrum on R-Type and this, to me, brings back the good old days of excellent games with tons of playable levels and good old fashioned fun. Buy it. Play it. Love it.\n\n\nDescription:\nAs the mysterious and powerful ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGuardian of EarthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ your steely eye and HYPER-POWERED LASER ARM have kept the citizens of Earth safe for generations (as well as proving a hit with the ladies).\nWith all your awesome TALENT and FLAIR, surely it would be IMPOSSIBLE for a devastating invasion of Doom Beasts to descend on your cities and cause havoc without your knowledge? (Even if you were MAYBE showboating for a magazine photo-shoot at the timeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦)\nNow, you must not only defend your cities from the ravenous hordes of Doom Beasts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you must defend yourself against accusations of gross incompetence from the Galactic Council of Justice! And this is all BEFORE you can even start to get to the bottom of just who OR what is really behind the attacksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\nStory mode featuring 15 levels over 5 unique stages\n11 enemy types\n5 gigantic boss battles\n4 Infinite Mode Stages\n24 Challenge Mode Stages\n14 Bonus Magazine articles to unlock\n12 Glittering Awards to discover\n6 Dramatic Courtroom cutscenes\nController Support\n\nPublisher: Kalypso Media Digital\nDevelopper: Mediatonic\nGenre: Action, Casual, Indie\nRelease name: WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.That.Flying.v1.0.cracked-THETA\nSize: 386MB\n\nFor more Details:- Jobs,movies,games,fixes,games fixes,Secrets, and lost of different kind of information you can find here.\n\n\n\n\nThis is quality upload. . . . . . . \n\nBecause i am upload only quality torrent....\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64323fbe8ffc05bb5b621d08bd88f320c2c5849","amp;dn":"Who%5C%27s+That+Flying+v1.0+cracked-THETA+by+%2ARoYStaR%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64323fbe8ffc05bb5b621d08bd88f320c2c5849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,67,35,251,232,255,192,91,181,182,33,208,139,216,143,50,12,44,88,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
