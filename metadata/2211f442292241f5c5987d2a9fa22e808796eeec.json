sky hangs over lonely city                   \n    streets, rotted oil derricks, and abandoned            \n    factories. This is Oil City, Pennsylvania, a           \n        fading industrial town in the heart of the             \n        American rust belt. It is the sort of town             \n        that Barrack Obama had in mind when he made            \n    his infamous comments about bitter small                  \n    town residents clinging to their guns and                  \n    religion as they watch the rest of the world               \n    pass them by. The peace and quiet is                   \n        shattered when the filmmaker, Oil City                 \n        native Joe Wilson, places the announcement             \n        of his wedding to another man in the local             \n    paper. The announcement catches the eye of             \n    Kathy Springer, a local woman whose teenage            \n    son, CJ, is being brutally tormented at                \n    school because he is gay.                                   \n                                                           \n                 \n                                                 \n                                                     \n                                                     \n                                                               \n    CJ Springer as Himself                                 \n    Kathy Springer as Herself                              \n        Joe Wilson as Himself                                  \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                               \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                           \n                                                                   \n                                                                   \n                     \n                                            \n                                              \n                                                \n                                                           \n        We are currently doing high quality XviD, TV           \n        and DVD Rips.                                          \n        We are always looking for new talent,                  \n    newbie or pro we want you!                                \n                                                               \n    If u wanna learn to rip quality Xvid or DVD                \n    we can teach you.                                      \n                                                               \n        We are always interested in affiling good              \n        sites in europe or asia.                               \n                                                           \n    IF you think you can provide anything that             \n    could be of use for us (shells, bots, dumps,               \n    coding or anything else you can think of)                  \n       do contact us with an offer we cannot refuse              \n        :-)                                                    \n                                                               \n                                                            \n                                                           \n             \n                                             \n                                                 \n                                                  \n                                                           \n         To all quality minded groups in the scene.            \n               And to all our old members.                     \n                                                               \n             \n                                      \n                                              \n                                               \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n              You can contact us by messaging us.             \n              Where you say?
