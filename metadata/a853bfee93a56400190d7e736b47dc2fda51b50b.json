Outgoing. Detailed. Funny. This is how clients describe Tom and his crew. His career began with a journalism degree and wanderlust. It continues with portraits, edgy light and restless creative energy. He often logs over 20,000 road trip miles a year creating images. Not to mention airplanes. He loves espresso, grunge bands and desert sunsets. And exploring light.\n\nJoin Tom Bol as he teaches this outdoor photography course from the famous mountain-biking Mecca of Moab, Utah. Tom is passionate about adventure sports and Moab is a terrific location to shoot. Follow Tom as he progresses from a simple setup using available lighting and moves on to more complex single-light setups and then on to more advanced lighting. During the course, Tom will be showing viewers how to achieve a decent shot in midday sun, how to freeze and blur the action, how to capture a sun star in the photograph, and much, much more. If you are shooting action outdoors, you won't want to miss this course.\n\nLesson 01 Introduction (4:01)\nLesson 02 Pan and Blur (13:05)\nLesson 03 Fill Light (7:05)\nLesson 04 A Figure in the Landscape (4:49)\nLesson 05 Equipment (10:16)\nLesson 06 Sunstar with Reflector (18:21)\nLesson 07 Action Shot with Two Lights (12:31)\nLesson 08 Edgy Portrait (18:56)\nLesson 09 Jump Shot (13:26)\nLesson 10 Nose Wheelie (6:08)\nLesson 11 POV Photography (8:47)\nLesson 12 Magic Arm (13:55)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CADbOaaDP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CADbOaaDP&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a853bfee93a56400190d7e736b47dc2fda51b50b","amp;dn":"Kelby+Training+-+Photographing+Adventure+Sports","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a853bfee93a56400190d7e736b47dc2fda51b50b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,83,191,238,147,165,100,0,25,13,126,115,107,71,220,47,218,81,181,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
