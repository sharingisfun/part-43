Now, 30 years later, Jacques' son Jean-Michel Cousteau and his expedition team have set sail to explore dangerous and spectacular locales across the globe in the high-definition series, Jean-Michel Cousteau: Ocean Adventures, premiering with the film Voyage to Kure.\n\nThe beluga whale is an evolutionary surprise -- a warm-blooded mammal in a numbingly cold sea. Resembling curious ghosts, these intelligent mammals use one of the most complex sonars of any animal. Belugas inhabiting Cook Inlet, close to Anchorage, Alaska, were added to the endangered species list in October 2008. Their world is now ground zero for climate change, but what threatens them is not confined to the Arctic, it's global. What lies ahead for the beluga could become prophesy for many species everywhere, including our own.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 47mn 5s 904ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 245 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 384 (1.625) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 122 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd6b91393ef7f95379d0bda03929e327b06dfd4","amp;dn":"PBS+Ocean+Adventures-+Sea+Ghosts.%282009%29.WS-PDTV.Xvid%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd6b91393ef7f95379d0bda03929e327b06dfd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,214,185,19,147,239,127,149,55,157,11,218,3,146,158,50,123,6,223,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
