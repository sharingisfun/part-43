This is the third update for that date, the earlier ones being at 1:31 AM and 5:31 AM.\n\n\nThis cablegate-201102090931.7z file is 9.14 MB (9,587,816 bytes) in size, and expands to 309 MB (324,131,899 bytes), containing 5,393 files in 137 folders.\n\nIf you're seeding an older CableGate torrent, seed this instead.  The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html (although sometimes http://wikileaks.ch/magnet.txt is updated first.)  The IP for this domain is 213.251.145.96.\n\nIf you run a local WikiLeaks &quot;pull&quot; / &quot;scrape&quot; mirror (search P2P networks for &quot;wikileaks scrape&quot;), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.\n\nThe bad guys can put up blocks to all known / major HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!\n\nHTTP download mirror at http://alexlibman.com/dl/wikileaks/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48369d445b3af9442c0caa934e97188145c1c58f","amp;dn":"WikiLeaks+CableGate+update+for+Feb+9th%2C+2011%2C+9%3A31+AM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48369d445b3af9442c0caa934e97188145c1c58f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,54,157,68,91,58,249,68,44,12,170,147,78,151,24,129,69,193,197,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
