As an artist, songwriter and producer, James provided the funky hits that resuscitated Motown Records in the late 70s. His Punk Funk sound updated the labels style and saw it through the mid-80s. By 1981, Rick was at the peak of his commercial success with the platinum selling Street Songs album and the hit singles &quot;Super Freak&quot; and &quot;Give It to Me Baby.&quot; \n\nThe following year, Rick James &amp; the Stone City Band took the stage in Essen, Germany to open the 10th Rockpalast-Festival. This 1982 performance was the first time James played in Europe, bringing his brand of American Punk Funk to a whole new audience. Together with the Stone City Band, James did not disappoint, burning up the stage with his trademark sound and special effects.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84147408cc588ca6ddba2b044327145a034daa6","amp;dn":"Rick+James%3A+Super+Freak+%28Live+1982%29+%5BDVD+Rip%5D+%28XVID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84147408cc588ca6ddba2b044327145a034daa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,65,71,64,140,197,136,202,109,219,162,176,68,50,113,69,160,52,218,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
