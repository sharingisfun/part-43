For a very short album -- only eight songs -- too many of the cuts fall flat. \n\nThose that succeed, however, are quite good, particularly Paul Barrere and Bill Payne's gently propulsive &quot;All That You Dream,&quot; Lowell George's beautiful &quot;Long Distance Love,&quot; and the sublime &quot;Mercenary Territory.&quot; \n\nEven these songs don't have the spark or character they would have had on the more organic Feats, due to George's exceedingly mellow So-Cal production, which is pleasant but doesn't provide Little Feat with enough room to breathe. \n\nThere are enough signs of Little Feat's true character on The Last Record Album -- the three previously mentioned songs are essential for any Feat fan -- to make it fairly enjoyable, but it's clear that the band is beginning to run out of steam. \n\nThe CD reissue of The Last Record Album includes two bonus tracks, &quot;Don't Bogart That Joint&quot; and &quot;A Apolitical Blues,&quot; that were originally included on the 1978 live album Waiting for Columbus. \n\nThey were pulled from the CD reissue of that album due to time restrictions, and appeared here instead (by Stephen Thomas Erlewine).\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nPaul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re - guitar, vocals\nSam Clayton - congas\nLowell George - vocals, guitar\nKenny Gradney - bass\nRichard Hayward - drums, vocals\nBill Payne - keyboards, synthesizer, vocals\n\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\nValerie Carter - backing vocals (tracks 3 and 5)\nJohn Hall - guitar (track 2)\nFran Tate - backing vocals (tracks 3 and 5)\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.&quot;Romance Dance&quot; (Paul BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Bill Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n2.&quot;All That You Dream&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n3.&quot;Long Distance Love&quot; (Lowell George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:43\n4.&quot;Day or Night&quot; (Payne, Fran Tate) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:24\n5.&quot;One Love Stand&quot; (BarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, Gradney, Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n6.&quot;Down Below the Borderline&quot; (George) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n7.&quot;Somebody's Leavin'&quot; (Payne) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:07\n8.&quot;Mercenary Territory&quot; (George, Hayward) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:27\n9.&quot;Bonus Announcement&quot;\n10.&quot;Don't Bogart That Joint&quot; (live) (E.
