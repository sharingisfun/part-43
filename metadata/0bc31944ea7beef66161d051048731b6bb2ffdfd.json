Among those you will study are the accounts of the creation of the world in Hesiod's Theogony and Ovid's Metamorphoses; the gods Zeus, Apollo, Demeter, Persephone, Hermes, Dionysos, and Aphrodite; the Greek Heroes, Theseus and Heracles (Hercules in the Roman version); and the most famous of all classical myths, the Trojan War.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc31944ea7beef66161d051048731b6bb2ffdfd","amp;dn":"TTC+Classical+Mythology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc31944ea7beef66161d051048731b6bb2ffdfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,195,25,68,234,123,238,246,97,97,208,81,4,135,49,182,187,47,253,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
