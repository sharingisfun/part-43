W. Murnau in 1921.\n\nLord VogelÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½d (Arnold Korff) is hosting a week-long hunting party with several of his friends at his castle, but the inclement weather has forced them to stay inside. An uninvited man shows up, Count Johann Oetsch (Lothar Mehnert). Baron SafferstÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tt (Paul Bildt) is at the party and his wife, the Baroness (Olga Tschechowa), will soon arrive. The Baroness's late husband, Count Peter Oetsch (Paul Hartmann), was murdered several years earlier and, though he was never convicted, it is common knowledge that his brother, Johann Oetsch, committed the crime. Oetsch is urged to leave, but refuses.\n\nWhen the Baroness and hears Oetsch is there, she wants to leave, but insists on waiting for Father Faramund, a priest from Rome who she has something to say to and is going to meet her at the castle.\n\nOetsch is not bothered by the wind and rain and decides to go hunting anyway. While he is out, Father Faramund arrives and speaks to the Baroness. That night, however, when she calls for him, his room is found empty. Oetsch is suspected of murdering him as well.\n\nFather Faramund is Count Oetsch. Knowing that he was innocent of the crime but uncertain if his suspicions of Baron SafferstÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tt were correct, he posed as Faramund and arrived before him, going to the Baroness to hear her confession. SafferstÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tt loved her and when he heard her say she wanted to see something evil, like a murder, he misunderstood and thought she wanted her husband killed. After the deed was done, she blamed herself and the two got married to seal their pact of secrecy, thus shifting suspicion to Oetsch.\n\nAfter the truth is revealed, SafferstÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½tt commits suicide and Oetsch is vindicated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4a068450b51d9be47ac69f3e2f75ad505e1331","amp;dn":"The+Haunted+Castle.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4a068450b51d9be47ac69f3e2f75ad505e1331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,74,6,132,80,181,29,155,228,122,198,159,62,47,117,173,80,94,19,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
