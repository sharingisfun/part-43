Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29868aabff4832c1f97bd678593cc6c540d6e7f","amp;dn":"Letters+From+Iwo+Jima","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29868aabff4832c1f97bd678593cc6c540d6e7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,152,104,170,191,244,131,44,31,151,189,103,133,147,204,108,84,13,110,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
