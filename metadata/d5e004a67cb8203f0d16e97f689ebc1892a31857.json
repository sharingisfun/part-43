The band established what would become the template for many other popular Spanish-speaking pop and rock music groups: clever, often mysterious lyrics, pleasing musical arrangements and an elaborate and glamorous aesthetic image. The band has sold over 7 million copies across Latin America.\n\nArtist: Soda Stereo.\nYears active: 1982-1997, Oct 2007 - Dec 2007.\nCountry: Argentina.\nAlbum: Dynamo + Rarities + Bootleg.\nGenre: Rock, Pop, Dream Pop, Shoegaze, Noise Pop.\n\nGustavo Cerati (Vocals, Guitars, MPC-60 and bass in Camaleon), Zeta Bosio (Bass, Choirs and Guitar in Camaleon), Charly Alberti (Drums and percussion). With the participation of: Daniel Melero (Sampler, Synth), 'Tweety' Gonzalez (Sampler, Assistant Programmer), Flavio Etcheto (Trumpet), Sanjay Bhadoriya (Table, Padanth Voice), Eduardo Blacher (Tambura), Roberto Kuczer (Sitar).\n\nReview by Allmusic: &quot;This album was Soda Stereo's most eclectic, most ignored, and most experimental work. It was also by far the least popular and the most pretentious. Just after its release the band changed labels (from Sony to BMG) and this fact conspired against the album's diffusion. Some fans didn't catch up with the band's intention, while others took it as a landmark of pop experimentation. The band used the sampler intensely and set the sound treatment carefully, but without leaving the pop structure. Daniel Melero co-wrote some of the songs and played keyboards, but the strong influence he had over the band was reaching an end. The album contains one of their most beautiful songs, En Remolinos, as well as the hits Primavera Cero and the smooth and delicate Fue.&quot;\n\n---\nTracklisting:\n\n1. Dynamo [1992] \n\n01.

I reduced some noise and adjusted the volume a bit (RMS normalization) but the original recording of this bootleg was not made by me. I decided to rescue the best of that concert and upload it, because the torrent I got it from sadly has been gone for at least a year. So credit goes to whoever decided to share these particular tracks in the first place. I'm sure fans will appreciate it, for a bootleg it sounds pretty damn good. :)\n\n--\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron.
