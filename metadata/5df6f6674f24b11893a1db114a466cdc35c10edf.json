Since 2009, Keaton Snyder had joined the band as their vibraphone player.\n\nOriginally formed in 2006 as Dodobird by multi-instrumentalist Meric Long, unpredictable San Francisco indie rock duo the Dodos acquired their new moniker with the arrival of Logan Kroeber, a fellow West Coast artist whose penchant for experimental drumming and progressive metal melded perfectly with Long's interest in West African Ewe drumming and country blues fingerpicking. The Dodos released their debut album, Beware of the Maniacs, that same year independently, followed by Visiter in 2008. Long and Kroeber added electric vibraphonist Keaton Snyder to the fold and collaborated with producer Phil Ek on 2009's Time to Die, which found the trio exploring a more fleshed-out sound.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dodos are known for using an alternate instrumental approach. Logan Kroeber plays on a drum kit without a bass drum, playing often on the rims of the drums, and also uses a tambourine taped to his shoe. During live performances they have a third member playing a vibraphone, and a drum and two cymbals placed on each other (like a hihat). Meric Long plays mainly acoustic and semi-acoustic guitars during performances, but he also owns a Springtime and a Tafelberg drum guitar built by Yuri Landman. Long has been known to favor using his fingernails instead of a guitar pick.\n\nNo Color\n\nThe Dodos' fourth album, No Color, was released on March 15, 2011. It features vocal contribution from Neko Case. Vibraphonist Keaton Snyder is not featured on this record.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dodos&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dodos&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
