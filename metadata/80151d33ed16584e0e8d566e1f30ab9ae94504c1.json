Dolphins, who are much more intelligent than they seem, act as the earth's caretakers, while dolphins and humans explore the galaxy. An alien force, known as the Foe, seeks to end this happy existence. The Foe damages the Earth's defense system, and alters history for the worse. One extraordinary dolphin, Ecco, must travel through time to set things right.\n\nEcco is a 3d underwater adventure game. There are more than 25 aquatic environments to explore. Ecco must communicate with other ocean creatures and learn to manipulate his environment if he is to succeed in defeating the Foe.\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% or Discjuggler (Both included in download).\n\nBest to burn at 4x or slowest.\n\nSet Burn Settings to Raw/Dao for Alcohol 120% or Raw write Mode 2 2352 CD-DA for Discjuggler, or Mode 1 2048 Raw Write if that doesn't work for discjuggler.\n\nAny DC Games that you burn make sure you allow overburning option in Alcohol or discjuggler, if your burner supports it.\n\nBurn at slowest speed possible for compatibility.\n\nUse Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD-R Media for best quality.\n\n\nGame Pics included\n\n\nAny Problems or questions, please post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80151d33ed16584e0e8d566e1f30ab9ae94504c1","amp;dn":"%5BDC%5D+Ecco+The+Dolphin+%5BNtsc%5D+%5BSelf-boot%5D+%5BCDI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80151d33ed16584e0e8d566e1f30ab9ae94504c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,21,29,51,237,22,88,78,14,141,86,110,31,48,171,154,233,69,4,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
