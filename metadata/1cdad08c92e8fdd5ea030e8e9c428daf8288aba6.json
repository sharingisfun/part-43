Born in New York on May 26, 1964 (his mother was actress Roxie Roker, best-known for her role as Helen Willis on the popular TV series The Jeffersons, and his father was a TV producer), Kravitz was raised in Los Angeles, where he found himself around countless musical giants as a youngster due to his parents friendships with the likes of Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, and Miles Davis. Kravitz was a member of the California Boys Choir until his teenage years, when he decided to pursue rock &amp; roll while in high school and under the heavily influence of funk rocker Prince. Kravitz's admiration of the Purple One was so great that he at first patterned his style and approach directly after Prince and became known as &quot;Romeo Blue&quot; (complete with blue contact lenses), but failed to land a recording contract. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tVirgin\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Fields Of Joy\n02.Always On The Run\n03.Stand By My Woman\n04.It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\n05.More Than Anything In This World\n06.What Goes Around Comes Around\n07.The Difference Is Why\n08.Stop Draggin' Around\n09.Flowers For ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«\n10.Fields Of Joy (Reprise)\n11.All I Ever Wanted\n12.When The Morning Turns To Night\n13.What The Fuck Are We Saying\n14.Butterfly\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cdad08c92e8fdd5ea030e8e9c428daf8288aba6","amp;dn":"Lenny+Kravitz+-+Mama+Said+%281991%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cdad08c92e8fdd5ea030e8e9c428daf8288aba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,218,208,140,146,232,253,213,234,3,14,142,156,66,141,175,130,136,171,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
