We see third party candidates and their impassioned supporters listed in secret government reports that call their allegiance into question and brand them as fanatics and extremists. \n\nSenate committee hearings and official FBI documents further illustrate the mindset of our elected officials as they classify homeschoolers, gun rights activists and anti-abortionists as threats against the existing social and political order; by default creating an entire nation of radicals and revolutionaries - where everyone is a suspectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ equally guilty until proven otherwise. \n\nHow has our government shown that they will deal with these people?  The same way as every other totalitarian regime throughout history - marginalize their activities then lock them up.  Prisons are being built; internment camps constructed and laws passed that deal severely with anyone who dares to step out of line or ask too many questions.\nWho are the potential domestic terrorists that will end up in these camps?  Read the documentation for yourself and hear what our experts have to say.  States rights take a front row seat in this new political thriller that is guaranteed to send shivers up your spine.
