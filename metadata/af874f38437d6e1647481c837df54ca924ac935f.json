The songs are all fine, the arrangements are all simple, everything's pretty much OK but nothing stands out. It's all nice and it's obvious that Billy Bragg isn't trying anything more than just that, but the final result is so easy going and smooth that it's a bit dull. From a songwriter who has done a lot better than this, an album like this is a disappointment. It's a good listen, but those who have heard Talking with the taxman about poetry, Don't try this at home or his Woody Guthrie albums with Wilco will find themselves playing these albums a lot more than this.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af874f38437d6e1647481c837df54ca924ac935f","amp;dn":"Billy+Bragg...England%2C+Half+English%282002%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af874f38437d6e1647481c837df54ca924ac935f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,135,79,56,67,125,110,22,71,72,28,131,125,245,76,169,36,172,147,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
