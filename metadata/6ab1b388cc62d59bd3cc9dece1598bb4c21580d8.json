Countess Vera Von Conti (MacDonald) is engaged to marry the dull Prince Otto Von Seibenheim (Claud Allister), whom she doesn't love. At the 11th hour, Vera decides to skip the wedding and instead heads to Monte Carlo, where she visits the casinos and begins losing in a heroic fashion. A handsome stranger spies the beautiful Vera and asks to touch her hair for luck, but instead it's Vera's luck that dramatically improves as she wins back her fortune. Vera immediately offers the man a job as her combination valet and good luck charm, not knowing that he's actually the wealthy and powerful Count Rudolph Falliere (Jack Buchanan). The Count plays along, pretending to be a commoner as he uses his new position with Vera to learn how he can win her heart. As one might expect, MacDonald sings several songs (including &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot;), and also duets with British music star Jack Buchanan on &quot;Whatever It Is, It's Grand&quot; and &quot;Always in All Ways.&quot; \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Monte Carlo (1930).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 698 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 081 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate : 944 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 5:4\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.147\n      Stream size : 610 MiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.0.3 (UTC 2004-12-20)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 30mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 82.7 MiB (12%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 504 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0021153\n\nEnglish audio; English, spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nEclipse rip\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab1b388cc62d59bd3cc9dece1598bb4c21580d8","amp;dn":"Ernst+Lubitsch+-+Monte+Carlo+%281930%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ab1b388cc62d59bd3cc9dece1598bb4c21580d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,177,179,136,204,98,213,155,211,204,157,236,225,89,139,180,194,21,128,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
