Some tracks were not replaced due to the fact that they were inherently lossy as if they came from the game (protoss3, for example). Others were not included because they could not be individualized or looped properly.\n\nMore notes to come when time allows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87d44e33c3f074f04bb2de071e9c262156c75deb","amp;dn":"CyberTootie%5C%27s+Original+StarCraft+MPQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87d44e33c3f074f04bb2de071e9c262156c75deb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,212,78,51,195,240,116,240,75,178,222,7,30,156,38,33,86,199,93,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
