(e-books and video)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a great example of how jews view humanity.  In fact, jews only view themselves as human, and the rest of the planet as goyim (cattle) or animals, or even insects.  The real story is that jews are not exactly human like the rest of us. They lack a lot of important human traits, such as a conscience, and the inability to do anything more than fake human emotions.\n\n\nNot much really needs said about this clip.  This is an Israeli soldier speaking about the Palestinian people they have trapped in the world's largest open air prison, where they are routinely shot, beat, kidnapped for their organs, raided by Israelis who hunt them for sport, deprived of basic needs like food, water, medicine, blocked from fishing their own waters, have their farms raided and destroyed etc.  The list of atrocities carried out by jews against Palestinians is so long it's disgusting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ecfca086c52a7ba12de76eabd796287710f2ff","amp;dn":"What+Jews+Think+Of+Humanity.+%28e-books+and+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ecfca086c52a7ba12de76eabd796287710f2ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,236,252,160,134,197,42,123,161,45,231,110,171,215,150,40,119,16,242,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
