Carey's first greatest hits, it comprises her first thirteen No.1 singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and several new tracks. It was certified 5x platinum in the U.S. after debuting within the top five on the Billboard 200, and it charted strongly elsewhere. \n\nSales of No.1s were higher than expected, and its commercial success has been credited with influencing the content of later greatest hits albums by other acts.\n\nCarey has said that she does not consider No.1s a greatest hits album, and has voiced her disappointment with the omission of what she calls her &quot;favorite songs.&quot; Reviews were mixed, with criticism directed towards both the new material and the decision to include only Carey's number 1 hits. The singles released from the album - &quot;Sweetheart&quot; with Jermaine Dupri, the Academy Award winning Whitney Houston duet &quot;When You Believe&quot; from the soundtrack to The Prince of Egypt, and &quot;I Still Believe&quot;.\n\nThe Album sold well across the world, but they were only moderately popular on U.S. radio. As of 2005 No.1s has sold over 17 million copies worldwide\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Sweetheart\t\t\t- Featuring JD  \n[02] When You Believe\t\t- With Whitney Houston (From Prince Of Egypt) \n[03] Whenever You Call\t\t- With Brian McKnight \n[04] My All\n[05] Honey\n[06] Always Be My Baby\n[07] One Sweet Day \t\t- With Boyz II Men\n[08] Fantasy\n[09] Hero\n[10] Dreamlover\n[11] I'll Be There\t\t\t- Featuring Trey Lorenz\n[12] Emotions\n[13] Someday\n[14] Love Takes Time\n[15] Vision Of Love\n[16] I Still Believe\t\t\t\n[17] Without You\t\t\t\t\n[18] Do You Know Where You're Going - (Theme From Mahogany)\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 01h:15m:48s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 184mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v7.6.2.9  MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\t\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B Pop\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 16 November 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Columbia Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.mariahcarey.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/MariahCarEY \n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Mariah+Carey \n                           -\n                           -\n                           - http://www.muzu.tv/mariahcarey \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cefcae0ad95fa67676fc1c3dde55b76c4c457945","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+No.1s+-+Mariah+Carey+-+184mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cefcae0ad95fa67676fc1c3dde55b76c4c457945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,252,174,10,217,95,166,118,118,252,28,61,222,85,183,108,76,69,121,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
