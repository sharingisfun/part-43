But i had some difficulties playing with vlc {vlc sucks with h264}\nThis is really compressed version you can find for this series anywhere.\nThis is a LEGENDARY SERIES for both exceptional video and exceptional surround sounds. \nCheck out about it - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/\nAnd also peek in to amazon to read reviews {bluray}\nJust enjoy my release............................\n.\n.\nFile name : Band.Of.Brothers.2001.EP1\nLanguage : English\nDuration : 1h 13mn\nVideo : h264\nAudio : AAC 5.1\nSource : Blurayrip\nSubtitle : English styled soft subs {ASS}\nFile size : 473 MB\nGenre : Action,Adventure\n.\n.\nThis is the first episode only. I will upload the remaining episodes regularly. So be patient. This will be one of my best uploads. There are so many dvdrips floating around. Mine is definitely better than those due to source being bdrip. The audio is in 5.1 so that everyone can enjoy this show in the way it is meant to be. My bandwidth is very limited so i cant upload every episode continuously. I will upload the remaining episodes with one or two days gap. Even if there is any delay just bare with me. You will get all the episodes for sure. And remember - &quot;there are no bad apples here&quot;.\n.\n.\n**VLC is having trouble displaying ass subs . Use klitemegakodecpack with coreavc**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b3c09cb36d735b6c7d4d06394d4570cfabefe5","amp;dn":"Band.Of.Brothers.2001.EP1.BDRip+X264-%7B860x482%7D+720p+KEVUKEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b3c09cb36d735b6c7d4d06394d4570cfabefe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,179,192,156,179,109,115,91,108,125,77,6,57,77,69,112,207,171,239,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
