One of jazz's greatest lyricists, at the time, Allison was making the transition from being a pianist who occasionally sang to becoming a vocalist who also played his own unusual brand of piano.  In addition to the original versions of &quot;Your Mind Is on Vacation,&quot; &quot;I Don't Worry About a Thing (Because I Know Nothing Will Turn out Right)&quot; and &quot;It Didn't Turn out That Way,&quot; he sings bluish versions of two standards (&quot;Meet Me at No Special Place&quot; and &quot;The Song Is Ended&quot;) and plays five instrumentals with his trio.  There are only 33 1/2 minutes of music on this straight reissue of the orignal LP, but the set is one of Mose Allison's most significant recordings.  ~ by Scott Yanow, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nMose Allison (Vocals and Piano) \nAddison Farmer (Double Bass) \nOsie Johnson (Drums) \n\nMose Allison - I Don't Worry About a Thing Tracks:\n01  I Don't Worry About a Thing 2:19 \n02  It Didn't Turn Out That Way 2:44 \n03  Your Mind Is on Vacation 2:37 \n04  Let Me See 4:12 \n05  Everything I Have Is Yours 4:08 \n06  Stand By 3:59 \n07  Idyll 4:19 \n08  The Well 3:23 \n09  Meet Me at No Special Place 2:36 \n10  The Song Is Ended 2:34 \nAll compositions by Mose Allison","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a6b883bf44c5b7cef0161ade77450286385af83","amp;dn":"Mose+Allison+-+I+Don%5C%27t+Worry+About+a+Thing+%281962%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a6b883bf44c5b7cef0161ade77450286385af83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,107,136,59,244,76,91,124,239,1,97,173,231,116,80,40,99,133,175,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
