These are the full OSTs, as far as I can tell, but there's a lot of music that didn't make it onto the discs.\n\nWhich is unfortunate. Never the less, all the Hymns seem to be included, and that's the main thing. Track names are in Japanese.\n\nThe second game is awesome, by the way. Haven't played the first one.\n\n\n...Also, is there any chance somebody's got a spare demonoid invite code lying around?\n\n(Lastly, my max up speed is about 55kb/s, so shush with the whining.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e404847ec8a086f8214267409f620da4d70ddd","amp;dn":"Ar+Tonelico+1%262+OSTs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e404847ec8a086f8214267409f620da4d70ddd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,228,4,132,126,200,160,134,248,33,66,103,64,159,98,13,164,215,13,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
