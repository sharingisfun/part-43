When they meet, it's love at first sight, for her all-consuming, for\nhim one of many happy bed partnerships as she later discovers. Deaths in her\nfamily soon make Juana Isabella's heir, but Ferdinand suggests she inherited\nher grandmother's madness and supports Philip's ambition to rule instead, which\nbecomes the stakes of political maneuvering in the Cortes (nobility-dominated\nparliament). Combined with Philip's incurable infidelity, which includes a\nMoorish whore-princess, multiple drama is inevitable, and worse follows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:517a651cd250e7470d4896fa861ffcc3566b5b6c","amp;dn":"Juana.La.Loca.2001.DVBRip.XviD-Movieboys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"517a651cd250e7470d4896fa861ffcc3566b5b6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,122,101,28,210,80,231,71,13,72,150,250,134,31,252,195,86,107,91,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
