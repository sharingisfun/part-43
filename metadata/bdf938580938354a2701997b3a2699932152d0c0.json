While obviously sounding similar to some of the work by his former band, May's path is far more hard-edged and emotionally punched than the majority of Queen's work. His vocals are sometimes weak for a singer, but they also add a certain tenderness that most hard rock frontmen seem to lack. The album succeeds best on its heaviest tracks such as the cover of &quot;Rollin' Over&quot; or &quot;Resurrection,&quot; which features pounding drums courtesy of Cozy Powell and thundering guitar riffs with Queen-like multi-tracked vocals. References to Queen can also be heard in the eccentric humor of such numbers as &quot;Love Token,&quot; which includes a back-and-forth dialogue in the middle of the song. Likewise, the low-key country song, &quot;Let Your Heart Rule Your Head,&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;'39&quot; off Queen's A Night at the Opera. The ballads are not as strong or as interesting and are not helped by well-meaning but overly sentimental lyrics and light rock arrangements. Unfortunately, the instrumental, &quot;Last Horizon,&quot; ends up sounding like Muzak. &quot;Driven By You,&quot; the album's biggest hit, was originally written for a Ford commercial, and it shows. That said, it is great to hear May finally get a chance to rock out and while the over-the-top and eccentric stylings of the album might put off some, it is those same traits that will also attract many to this work.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdf938580938354a2701997b3a2699932152d0c0","amp;dn":"Brian+May-Back+To+The+Light+%28FLAC%29+%5Btntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdf938580938354a2701997b3a2699932152d0c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,249,56,88,9,56,53,74,39,1,153,123,58,38,153,147,33,82,208,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
