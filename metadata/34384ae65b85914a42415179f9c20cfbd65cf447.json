The tire's name is Robert. One day Robert becomes sentient and decides to venture out into the world. It's a moving scene as Robert takes his first halting rolls and discovers the joy of squashing a plastic bottle and then a scorpion, until he is stopped by a glass bottle. frustrated Robert soon discovers his true powerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦he can make things blow-up with his mind. Pretty soon he's on the road and heading straight for the local population and a mysterious girl who he sets his sights on. Meanwhile on a remote hillside the audience have gathered to watch his apparent path of wanton destruction, with intrigue, apathy, joy and sadness. Standing between them and their viewing pleasure is a cranky sheriff who really wants to go home, and the lack of food and basic resources, which sets the crowd on edge.\n\nIf that all sounds a bit weird then believe me that's not even the half of it. Rubber is a deeply strange movie. Robert is almost a sympathetic character. The way he is framed and the audience's investment in his &quot;birth&quot; and journey give him a Wall-E type of existence. He almost wish that he succeeds in his apparent mission of getting the girl. Roxane Mesquida plays the girl. Unfortunately she's given little else to do than be the token female. Aside from a brief scene were she's forced to try lure Robert into a trap she doesn't even say much. The real star of the show is Stephen Spinella as Lieutenant Chad, the world weary law-man who is convinced it's all a show and that the movie would be over if the audience just went away. He's opening monologue, direct to camera, is a work of twisted genius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\nRelease Title......: Rubber 2010 BRRip XviD AC3-TDP\n\nRipper.............: TDP\n\nSize.............. : 1:40 GB\n\nRuntime............: 01:18:54\n\nAvg Bitrate........: 2541 Kb/s\n\nAudio..............: AC3, 48000 HZ, 5:1, 448 Kb/s\n\nVideo..............: mpeg4, yuv 420p, \n\nResolution.........: 720 x 404\n\nFPS................: 29.97 \n\nLanguage...........: English\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie Info:\n\n\n\nIMDB:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612774/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nDirector...........: Quentin Dupieux\n\nWriter.............: Quentin Dupieux\n\nStars..............: Stephen Spinella, Jack Plotnick and Wings Hauser\n\nGenres.............: Comedy | Drama | Horror | Mystery | Sci-Fi\n\nRelease Date.......: 10 November 2010\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&lt;/a&gt;\n==================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7681/rubbers.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img855.imageshack.us/img855/7681/rubbers.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n######## ########  ########  \n   ##    ##     ## ##     ## \n   ##    ##     ## ##     ## \n   ##    ##     ## ########  \n   ##    ##     ## ##        \n   ##    ##     ## ##        \n   ##    ########  ##        \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34384ae65b85914a42415179f9c20cfbd65cf447","amp;dn":"Rubber+2010+BRRip+XviD+AC3-TDP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34384ae65b85914a42415179f9c20cfbd65cf447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,56,74,230,91,133,145,74,66,65,81,121,249,194,12,251,214,92,244,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
