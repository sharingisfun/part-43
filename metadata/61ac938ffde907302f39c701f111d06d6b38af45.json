In the late 1990s, DJ Screw made hundreds of mixtapes using this technique, selling them out of the trunk of his car until demand grew so large that he opened a shop. He gained a loyal following in his hometown and abroad, only to die of a heart attack after overdosing on some drank at his studio.\n\n\n\nDISC 1\n\n 1. I Want To Be Remembered\n 2.
