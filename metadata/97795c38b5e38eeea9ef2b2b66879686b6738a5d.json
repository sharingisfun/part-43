Harrington\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press\nDate:2010-11-30\nFormat: pdf\nLanguage: English\nISBN10: 0521899362\nPages:488\nISBN13: 9780521899369\n\nProduct Description: Listing more than 500 sky targets, both near and far, in 187 challenges, this observing guide will test novice astronomers and advanced veterans alike. Its unique mix of Solar System and deep-sky targets will have observers hunting for the Apollo lunar landing sites, searching for satellites orbiting the outermost planets, and exploring hundreds of star clusters, nebulae, distant galaxies, and quasars. Each target object is accompanied by a rating indicating how difficult the object is to find, an in-depth visual description, an illustration showing how the object realistically looks, and a detailed finder chart to help you find each challenge quickly and effectively. The guide introduces objects often overlooked in other observing guides and features targets visible in a variety of conditions, from the inner city to the dark countryside. Challenges are provided for the naked eye, through binoculars and the largest backyard telescopes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97795c38b5e38eeea9ef2b2b66879686b6738a5d","amp;dn":"Cosmic+Challenge+-+The+Ultimate+Observing+List+for+Amateurs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97795c38b5e38eeea9ef2b2b66879686b6738a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,121,92,56,181,227,142,238,169,239,43,43,102,135,150,134,182,115,138,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
