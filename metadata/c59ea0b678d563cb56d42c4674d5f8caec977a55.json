There was no doubt de Mello was the most skilled mediator at the UN, perhaps the only one who could balance the delicate intricacies that the situation presented. Yet he was also the person that the UN ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the world ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ could least afford to lose.\n\nOn August 19th, 2003, a bomb exploded outside the UN headquarters in Baghdad. Among the 22 killed was Sergio Vieira de Mello. Years later, the shadow of uncertainty continues to loom heavily over Iraq.\n\nOne of the most tireless and effective advocates for peace and stability the world has ever known, the Brazilian born diplomat traversed the globe using his uncommon diplomatic skills to accomplish the impossible. Travelling to four continents and featuring the stories and reminiscences of colleagues and luminaries whose lives he touched, this award-winning documentary is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa testament to the power of diplomacy and the proven impact of an insouciant, simple charm that reaches people on a human levelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Sun Sentinel, Florida).\n\nWINNER! Silver Medal Award, UN Correspondents Association\nOFFICIAL SELECTION - Tribeca Film Festival\nOFFICIAL SELECTION - Human Rights Film Festivals, Paris &amp; Geneva","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59ea0b678d563cb56d42c4674d5f8caec977a55","amp;dn":"Sergio+Vieira+de+Mello%3A+En+Route+to+Baghdad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59ea0b678d563cb56d42c4674d5f8caec977a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,158,160,182,120,213,99,203,86,212,44,70,116,213,248,202,236,151,122,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
