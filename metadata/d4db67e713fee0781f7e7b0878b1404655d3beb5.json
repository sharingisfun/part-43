What is crucial is how you see a \nchosen subject ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and then how this vision is \ntransformed into a permanent image using \nphotographic techniques and composition. \n\nA    PRACTICAL  APPROACH \n\nThis book adopts a practical approach to \nhelp you master photography. The largest \nsection covers a wide range of photographic \ngenres, including portraiture, still life, \nlandscapes, architecture, and natural history. \nAll these are illustrated with behind-the- \nscenes shots of me out on location or in a \nstudio actually taking the pictures. These \nphoto set-ups reveal exactly how a shot \nwas taken, the equipment that was used, \nthe camera angle, and the wider settings \nfrom which the pictures were derived. \n    A technical understanding of your camera \nis important, as it allows you to capture the \npictorial qualities of a scene in the best way \npossible, whether you are using film or a \ndigital chip. These fundamental camera \ncontrols are illustrated in the first section \nof the book using both diagrams and \nphotographs. The more familiar you become \nwith the controls and lens settings on your \nown particular camera, the more attention \nyou can pay to composition and timing. \n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.45\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 4000\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n4/18/2010 2:23:01 AM\nmbam-log-2010-04-18 (02-23-01).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 0\nTime elapsed: 22 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&lt;/a&gt;  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n\nALWAYS SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4db67e713fee0781f7e7b0878b1404655d3beb5","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Photography+%5BPDF%5D%5BEnglish%5Dbig_dad_e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4db67e713fee0781f7e7b0878b1404655d3beb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,219,103,231,19,254,224,120,31,126,123,8,120,177,64,70,85,211,190,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
