I have an electronic/alternative/instrumental kind of musical project called Neutron Union, and I've decided to release it for free! It's released under my own personal record company, Subastral Sounds.\n\nIt would be arrogant of me to say my music defies genre, but it's certainly different. I would say it sounds like a cross between Daft Punk, Amon Tobin, Moby, and something else altogether.\n\n\n\nHere's the tracklist:\n1. How To Fly\n2. Omega Planet\n3. Cylindrical Patterns\n4. Strange Faces\n5. Faith And Doubt\n6. Escapism\n7. Sunshine Over Dublin\n8. Surrideo In Pluvia\n\nPlus! Two bonus tracks!\n9. Abduction\n10. streetfengshui\n\nIt comes with all 320 kbps mp3s tagged with the cover art, as well as a disc picture in case you want to print it out and put it on a burned cd.\n\nEnjoy, and don't forget to seed if you like it!\nPeace\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f491bd52a0eda61a8b47a7075b2e7ff7b77a119","amp;dn":"Neutron+Union+-+Atomic+Gods+And+Acid+Dreams+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f491bd52a0eda61a8b47a7075b2e7ff7b77a119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,73,27,213,42,14,218,97,168,180,122,112,117,178,231,255,123,119,161,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
