Through its different components, the author explains how children and teens, by way of self-reflection and communication, can gain a better understanding of their needs, wants, expectations, and emotions Exercises are offered to help one get in touch with emotions, to relax, and to listen to self-talk.&quot;--Library Journal\n\n&quot;At first, Healthy Anger seems like an oxymoron. But Bernard Golden helps us understand how anger can be not only normal, but essential to healthy growth--if we know how to guide and control it. And Golden shows us in plain, easy steps how to help our children do just that.&quot;--Myrna B. Shure, Ph.D., author of Raising a Thinking Child\n\n&quot;Healthy Anger is a comprehensive sourcebook of practical information for parents. A vital message in this book is that anger does not need to lead to violence. Highly recommended.&quot;--Charles E. Schaefer, Ph.D., Professor, Psychology Department, Fairleigh Dickinson University\n\n&quot;Golden confirms what I have long suspected--the origins of adult 'toxic' anger reside in childhood. I found the discussion of 'child logic' and shame especially helpful. I will be a better anger therapist for having read this book!&quot; --W. Doyle Gentry, Ph.D., author of Anger-Free: Ten Basic Steps to Managing Your Anger............\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:382813e3803b96db9bff24457b6196420fd1e2d0","amp;dn":"Healthy+Anger%3A+How+to+Help+Children+and+Teens+Manage+Their+Anger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"382813e3803b96db9bff24457b6196420fd1e2d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,40,19,227,128,59,150,219,155,255,36,69,123,97,150,66,15,209,226,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
