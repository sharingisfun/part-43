The UK edition of the 12&quot; single included a free poster. The version on the 7&quot; single was slightly shorter than that on the original LP.\n\nKim Wilde (born Kim Smith, 18 November 1960 in Chiswick, west London) is an English pop singer, author and television presenter. She burst onto the music scene in 1981 with the new wave classic &quot;Kids in America&quot;, which hit number two in the UK Singles Chart. Major U.S. success eluded her until 1987, when she topped the charts with her version of The Supremes' hit &quot;You Keep Me Hangin' On&quot;. Since 1998, Wilde had an alternative career as a gardener, whilst still being active in music.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Blonde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Blonde&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaDAKaADk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaDAKaADk&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:29\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
