Anyhow, a portion of the footage I'm in reference to \nfirst off that generated quite a lot of attention from a number of folks (i.e. \nvictim's families, newspapers and such) were the totally uncensored and never-\nbefore-seen crime-scene shots of the aftermath of the infamous &quot;Tate/LaBianca&quot; \nmurders committed by Charles Manson's so-called &quot;love-cult&quot; in early '69. These \nincredibly graphic, eye-popping and downright terrifying images are shown to us \nin such lengthy close-up detail that you can actually see the stab/entry wounds \nand the pain on the victim's faces even (particularly when it comes to the shots \nof the poor pregnant Sharon Tate and her friend the coffee heiress Abigail Folger). \nHonestly here, if they don't leave your jaw gaping open for a few minutes then I \nswear there's got to be something seriously wrong with your mental state! The second \ndreaded and unforgettable (in a psychologically traumatizing way I mean) portion \nis the live on-camera suicide of one R. Budd Dwyer. Who was reportedly a \nPennsylvanian State Representative/Treasurer who was apparently set to be \nsent up the river (i.e. he was going to have to serve a lot of jail time) on \na series of charges in which he claimed he was totally innocent of right \nbefore he did this at a press conference that he had requested for himself. \nBoth the Manson murders and Dwyer's self-inflicted on-air death are the kinds \nof things that have stuck in my mind, unfortunately enough, for years after \nwatching! Much like the first &quot;Death Scenes&quot; this is also the kind of thing \nthat I simply cannot recommended to anyone else!\n\nfilename:       Death.Scenes.II.Uncensored.Scenes.of.Death.DVDRip.XviD-T3.avi\nfilesize:       729,122,816\nvideo codec:    XviD ISO MPEG-4\nvideo bitrate:  993kbps\nbits per pixel: 0.240\nduration:       1:27:41\nresolution:     432*320\nfps:            29.970\nframe count:    157650\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  102kbps VBR\naudio channels: 2\nAudio Tracks:   1 [1-Main Movie]\nLanguage:       English\nSubtitles:      None\nsource:         Anthem Pictures R1 DVD\nimdb:          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228199/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228199/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs stated above, these rips are sourced from the Anthem Pictures R1 DVD releases \n(though the DVDs are obviously themselves sourced from VHS, you can see a noise \nbar at the bottom throughout the videos).
