It was included on their album ABBA (released April 1975).\n\nIt was, however, released as an A-side in Australia in 1974, where it reached number 49, and in New Zealand in 1977, where it reached number 8.\n\nABBA is the third album by the Swedish pop group of the same name, first released in 1975. Also known as &quot;The Limo[usine] Album&quot; among fans.\n\nFollowing the Eurovision success of &quot;Waterloo&quot;, ABBA saw the band gaining worldwide recognition. &quot;I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do&quot; topped the charts in Australia, as did &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; shortly thereafter. &quot;SOS&quot; and &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; became hits in both the U.S. and UK, and two of their most famous songs. ABBA was first released on CD in West Germany in 1987 (later released internationally), with five bonus tracks of songs from Waterloo and Ring Ring, which had not been released on CD at that time. ABBA was released on CD in Sweden in 1988 featuring the original 11 tracks only. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form three times; first in 1997, then in 2001 and again in 2005 as part of The Complete Studio Recordings box set.\n\nABBA was a Swedish pop music group formed in Stockholm  in 1972, consisting of Anni-Frid &quot;Frida&quot; Lyngstad, BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Agnetha FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog. Throughout the band's existence, FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Andersson - although both couples later divorced. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, and they topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1982.\n\nABBA gained international popularity employing catchy song hooks, simple lyrics, sound effects (reverb, phasing) and a Wall of Sound achieved by overdubbing the female singers' voices in multiple harmonies. As their popularity grew, they were sought after to tour Europe, Australia, and North America, drawing crowds of ardent fans, notably in Australia. Touring became a contentious issue, being particularly cumbersome for FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog, but they continued to release studio albums to widespread commercial success. At the height of their popularity, however, both relationships began suffering strain that led ultimately to the collapse of first the Ulvaeus-FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ltskog marriage (in 1979) and then of the Andersson-Lyngstad marriage in 1981. In the late 1970s and early 1980s these relationship changes began manifesting in the group's music, as they produced more thoughtful, introspective lyrics with different compositions.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06a789bbc2a5bdf4b7bc652f53a5617a477652ec","amp;dn":"ABBA+-+I%5C%27ve+Been+Waiting+For+You+%28Beat+Club%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06a789bbc2a5bdf4b7bc652f53a5617a477652ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,167,137,187,194,165,189,244,183,188,101,47,83,165,97,122,71,118,82,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
