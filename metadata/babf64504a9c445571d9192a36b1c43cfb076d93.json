By including these junk\n headers they are making their releases unplayable in some standalone players without\n remuxing. Included in /PROOF are pictures of what happens when you try to play their\n releases in the Phillips DV642. The files are renamed due to the 8 character name restriction.\n\n If you simply remux the file in Vdub, the result will be 1mb smaller and play perfectly fine\n however there is no reason to be padding releases and causing incompatibilities with playback.\n \n We thought this practice was done away with. Guess we were too hopeful. Enjoy thisworking\n release. Oh and lastly, how about cutting the end a bit better, it looks like it's missing something\n but it's not.\n\n **Yes we know the pictures are sucky quality but they do the job and yes we expect to be nuked\n but ASAP already got nuked on this issue the other day and then unnuked but obviously the problem\n isn't fixed **\n\n SHORT: junk.header.data.causes.issues.with.standalone.playback\n\n\n            Think you have what it takes to be a part of 2X?\n                          &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aacec5d9cfdbdfc3d9eac9d8d3dadec5c7cbc3c684c5d8cd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n                            \n                                                          \n                                                   \n                                                  \n                                                  \n                                         \n                                                   \n                          \n                                       \n                                                   \n                                     \n                             \n                         \n                  \n               RESPECT TO        \n        \n       \n       \n         FQM       \n   \n        \n                  2x    \n                        SunZero 2oo6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:babf64504a9c445571d9192a36b1c43cfb076d93","amp;dn":"Smallville.S10E13.PROPER.HDTV.XviD-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"babf64504a9c445571d9192a36b1c43cfb076d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,191,100,80,74,156,68,85,113,217,25,42,54,177,196,60,251,7,109,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
