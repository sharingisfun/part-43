The wars were characterized by bitter ethnic conflicts between the peoples of the former Yugoslavia, mostly between Serbs on the one side and Croats, Bosniaks and Albanians on the other.\n\nOften described as Europe's deadliest conflicts since World War II, they were characterized by mass war crimes and ethnic cleansing. \n\nAlbeit tensions in Yugoslavia had been mounting since the early 1980s, it was 1990 that proved the decisive year in which war became more likely. At the last Communist party conference in Belgrade in 1991, the congress voted for an end to the one-party system, as well as economic reform, which prompted the Slovenian and Croatian delegations to walk out and thus the break-up of the party, a symbolic event representing the end of &quot;brotherhood and unity&quot;.\n\nThe Yugoslav wars may be considered to comprise of two sets of successive wars affecting all of the six former Yugoslav republics, including Kosovo:\n\n* Wars during the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia:\n\n1. War in Slovenia (1991)\n2. Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995)\n3. Bosnian War (1992-1995)\n\n* NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995)\n\n* Wars in Albanian-populated areas:\n\n1.
