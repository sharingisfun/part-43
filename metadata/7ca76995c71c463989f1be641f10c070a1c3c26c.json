During this time, McGhee became a staple on the blues-folk revival circuit, and accordingly these recordings find the Piedmont bluesman playing in a folk style, which he excelled at. Many of the most powerful tracks are straight from the rural Piedmont tradition, but the folkier material shows what a rich musician he was. It's an excellent sampler, one that demonstrates the depth and breadth of his Folkways recordings.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca76995c71c463989f1be641f10c070a1c3c26c","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Brownie+McGhee+-+The+Folkways+Years","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca76995c71c463989f1be641f10c070a1c3c26c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,167,105,149,199,28,70,57,137,241,190,100,31,16,192,112,161,195,194,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
