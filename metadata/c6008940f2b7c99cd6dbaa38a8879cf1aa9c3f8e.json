The most tracks on this torrent are unpublished ones,\nprovided in MP3 VBR V0 quality. Published tracks are downgraded\nto MP3 VBR V9 quality. Tracks cover ACID, HARD and EXPERIMENTAL\ntechno subgenres, and you can expect to hear some strange (bad)\nproductions, really weird noises and distortions and unusual drum\nsets. The most tracks are somewhat monotonous, but understand that\nthey were not made for home listening. If you go mad by listening\nthem in complete - do not send complaints, you have been warned :o)\n\nWhat is missing are tracks still on Philips DCC tape and some other\nquite experimental tracks on ordinary tapes, for which we found no\ntime (+ no equipment in DCC case) to migrate on CDs.\n\nMachines used:\n\nROLAND TR-808\nROLAND TR-707\nSIMONS SDS-8\nROLAND TB-303\nROLAND SH-2\nROLAND SH-3A (no keyboard, just \\&quot;the head\\&quot; using CV/GATE interface)\nROLAND CSQ-600\nYAMAHA CS-5\nProtoboard disadjusted and clipped RING MODULATOR\n\nROLAND R-8M (with TR-808/909 sound expanssion card)\nROLAND W-30 / CASIO FZ-10M (sampling)\nsome ALESIS FX units\n\nMACKIE 1604 VLZ\n\nAMIGA 600 / ATARI 1040 (sequencing)\n\nat some point we actualy had BEHRINGER COMPRESSOR on kick / baseline!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou are free to use and share tracks provided in any way but making\nmoney seling them!
