In the grand tradition of the serialized cliffhanger, The Indian Tomb picks up right where The Tiger of Eschnapur ends. Together, these films provide the cinematic link between the classic silent serials and the modern action/adventures of Indiana Jones and The Mummy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9080a8dcb0df666095f15b023ebd3cdf438ac615","amp;dn":"The+Tiger+of+Eschnapur+%26+The+Indian+Tomb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9080a8dcb0df666095f15b023ebd3cdf438ac615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,128,168,220,176,223,102,96,149,241,91,2,62,189,60,223,67,138,198,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
