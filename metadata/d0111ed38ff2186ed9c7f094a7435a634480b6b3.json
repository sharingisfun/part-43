Fitts has a BA from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from the Wharton School. She serves on the board of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solari.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solari.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solari.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solari.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Austin_Fitts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Austin_Fitts&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also talks with Ted Gunderson [hour 4*], a former United States Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who believes the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was destroyed not by a truck bomb, but by a highly classified government pineapple-sized &quot;barometric bomb&quot; that was developed by Hercules Manufacturing in Silicon Valley, California, under a government contract. Gunderson was honored as Outstanding Law Enforcement Officer in America by the AFL-CIO Metal Trade Counsel Los Angeles, CA in 1977. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tedgunderson.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tedgunderson.net/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.educate-yourself.org/tg/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.educate-yourself.org/tg/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Gunderson&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Gunderson&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n*INTERESTING NOTE:  In the 2nd half of hour 4 -- at about 15:40 in file Alex_Jones_Show_2010_04_21__4b.mp3 -- just after Gunderson began talking about meeting with Osama bin Laden in the spring of 1986, Alex lost all power in the studio.  This caused about 30 seconds worth of dead air, followed by a couple of minutes of fill-in music and an excerpt from a Corbet Report clip. Rather than editing any of this out, I left it in just as it was live on the stream.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the latest news and takes a number of calls.\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
