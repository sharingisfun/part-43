Into this heady atmosphere they delivered one of the most famous rock albums of all time, 'Machine Head'. \n1972 saw them premier the new album at concerts in Europe, Japan and America (with no fewer than six tours there that year), delivering the powerful new 'Machine Head' set. It was a concert in the Danish capital of Copenhagen that the first (and only) full film of the famous Mk 2 line-up presented here was made, and is now available on DVD for the first time. \n\nRecorded March 1, 1972, it was originally filmed by Danmark Radio, Denmark's national radio and television station. The actual black and white footage was never screened in full and ended up lying dormant in the company's vaults. \n\nThe tour continued through to 1973 when Deep Purple returned to America, selling out more shows and shifting more albums than they had ever done. A camera crew turned up to film the group in New York in May for the 'In Concert' show, and this is also released here for the first time in glorious color (on any format), including the only performance of the line-up doing 'Smoke on The WaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.
