This journey of exile became known as the Trail of Tears.\n\nHistorians Perdue and Green reveal the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s betrayals and the divisions within the Cherokee Nation, follow the exiles along the Trail of Tears, and chronicle the hardships found in the West. In its trauma and tragedy, the Cherokee diaspora has come to represent the irreparable injustice done to Native Americans in the name of nation buildingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and in their determined survival, it represents the resilience of the Native American spirit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93c4c8e22683949452c828a5205e2b14af09f3f7","amp;dn":"Cherokee+Nation+and+the+Trail+of+Tears+-+Theda+Perdue+%282008+Hist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93c4c8e22683949452c828a5205e2b14af09f3f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,196,200,226,38,131,148,148,82,200,40,165,32,94,43,20,175,9,243,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
