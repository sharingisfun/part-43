It is one more step to take advantage of flaws in the PS3 controller BD. \n\nThe change is based on skip two steps in the upgrade process. &quot;BD FIRMWARE&quot; and &quot;Blu-ray Disc Player Revoke list.&quot; Whose patches are: \n\n0x3CF0 offset = 0x419E0044 \noffset = 0x48000034 0x3C50 \n\nThis allows you to skip the two functions related to the BD-Drive. Avoid the error and let the system continue to update. \n\nStill not solved the problem without running Hombrews reader. I hope a solution comes soon. Yet the purpose of this is not piracy, but a step to the console without reader scene. \n\nUSE \nActivate Service Mode. \nCopy the root of the USB Lv2diag.self entered. \nCopy the root file update PS3UPDAT.PUP desired. \nTurn on the PS3 with the USB port inserted in 0 (the closest to the reader.) \nWait until it turns off. \nCopy the STEP2 Lv2diag.self (not provided for me). \nInsert the USB port 0. \nTurn and go off within seconds. \nCLARIFICATIONS \n\nNeedless to say, but just in case. It is your responsibility. Compatibility is the same as the original Lv2diag.self. Lv2diag is a dangerous tool, to inform it.
