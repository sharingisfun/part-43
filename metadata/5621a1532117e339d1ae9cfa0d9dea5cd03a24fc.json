Rumpole is a wine-imbibing friend of the South London criminal classes, and the scourge of all QCs. Acting as narrator, he tells a series of stories involving legal chicanery, criminal derring-do and startling coincidence, spiced with a modicum of domestic strife at home.\n\nFour episodes of approx 45 minutes each.\n\n\n\nEpisode 1 - Rumpole And The Primrose Path:\nRumpole exposes criminal practices at the nursing home where he has been sent to recuperate after a heart attack, which has left him in dire need of claret, cheroots and good company!.\n\nEpisode 2 - Rumpole And The Scales Of Justice:\nWhen Rumpole is called upon to defend a senior member of the police force in court, his relish for the tragedy of Shakespeare's Othello, and his old acquaintances among the south London criminal fraternity prove very useful, and help him balance the scales of justice in favour of the of the maligned defence barrister.\n\nEpisode 3 - Rumpole And The Vanishing Juror:\nRumpole's admiration for the integrity of the Old Bailey jury is legendary, but in this story he encounters a juror in a murder trial who has a very personal and very dramatic agenda.\n\nEpisode 4 - Rumpole Redeemed:\nJohn Mortimer's legal eagle solves the conundrum of an ex con who seems to have been redeemed, and one who evidently hasn't, and also seeks redemption for his own sins of omission at the Lysander health club! In passing, he also bestows redemption on several of his associates who, in various preposterous ways, are in dire need of it!.\n\n\n\nDirected By Marilyn Imrie\n\nWith:\nHorace Rumpole....Timothy West\nHilda....Prunella Scales\nClaude Erskine-Brown....Nigel Anthony\nCommander Bob Durden....Geoffrey Whitehead\nChris Swithin....Philip Jackson\nChristine....Hetty Baynes\nDr Petrus Wakefield....John Rowe\nFelicity Halliday....Ellie Beaven\nGervase Johnson....Stephen Critchlow\nHermione swithin....Felicity Montagu\nHugo Winterton....Anton Rodgers\nJudge Denis Wintergreen....Karl Johnson\nJustice Graves....Ian Masters\nJustice Sloper....Ian Masters\nKnuckles Huckersley....Ewan Bailey\nLiz Probert....Elaine Claxton\nLuci Gribble....Sophie Thompson\nMarcia Brewster....Marlene Sidaway\nMarston Dawlish....David Shaw-parker\nMr Beazley....Nicholas Le Prevost\nMr Parkin....Ewan Bailey\nMr Phelps....David Shaw-Parker\nmr rankin....David Shaw-Parker\nMrs Justice Erskine-Brown....Joanna David\nNeville J Skeate....David Holt\nNurse Dotty Albright....Joanna David\nSamuel Ballard....Michael Cochrane\nSir Mike Smedley....Kim Durham\nSister Sheila Bradwell....Carole Boyd\n\n\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : 128\nMode : joint stereo\nFrequency : 44100 Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.95\nSize: 160 MB\n\n\nRipped from the audio torrent site radioarchive.cc - Registration is FREE!!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5621a1532117e339d1ae9cfa0d9dea5cd03a24fc","amp;dn":"Rumpole+and+the+Primrose+Path+-+John+Mortimer+++%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5621a1532117e339d1ae9cfa0d9dea5cd03a24fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,33,161,83,33,23,227,57,209,174,156,250,13,157,234,92,208,58,36,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
