Mullen, &quot;This Good Day&quot; - Fernando Ortega).\nThe great thing about this collection is that many of these are songs you probably haven't heard for quite awhile. Even if you wore your old records out, it might be time to give these songs another listen. And, if all you have are your old records, the more contemporary cuts on this CD will expand your horizons.\n\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43dd8112aeb32479a0a465d14ae54a55b5394e2","amp;dn":"Word+Gold+-+2001+-+Five+Decades+Of+Hits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43dd8112aeb32479a0a465d14ae54a55b5394e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,61,216,17,42,235,50,71,154,10,70,93,20,174,84,165,91,83,148,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
