Hanoi Rock's career was cut tragically short after the death of their drummer Razzle from a car accident involving Vince Neil (Motley Crue). \n\nHanoi Rocks were a telling influence on the glitzy US metal of Guns 'N' Roses and Motley Crue, as well as later glam prime movers Rachel Stamp and Backyard Babies. Certainly, these London-based Finns put raw power and exuberant excess back on the agenda after the dowdy days of post-punk. \n\nDecadent, Dangerous, Delicious, a 2-CD, 31-track anthology, is a collection of the best from their first five albums, plus a scattering of oddities. Among the rarities are two tracks from their very first studio session, and a calypso version of live favourite &quot;Malibu Beach&quot; sung by their drummer Razzle, whose untimely death in a car crash caused the band's eventual split. Despite lacking anything from their final album Two Steps From The Move (recorded for CBS and unavailable for inclusion), this is still a fine showcase for their moving mix of sleazy blues, sweet pop and caustic, anthemic rock &amp; roll. A genuine celebration of Hanoi Rocks has been a long time coming; it's more than well-deserved.\n\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Kill City Kills \t\t- (Alternate Version)\n[02] Tragedy\n[03] Pretender\n[04] Back To The Mystery City\n[05] Tooting Bec Wreck\n[06] Taxi Driver\n[07] Love's An Injection\n[08] Lost In The City\n[09] Motorvatin'\n[10] Teenangels Outsiders\n[11] No Law Or Order\n[12] Oriental Beat\n[13] Malibu Beach Nightmare \t- (Rock Version)\n[14] Village Girl\n[15] Fallen Star\n[16] Dead By Xmas\n \n     Disc 01 - Play Time - 00h:59m:37s\n\n\nDisc 02\n\n[01] Beer And A Cigarette\n[02] Problem Child\n[03] It's Too Late\n[04] I Feel Alright \t\t- (Live)\n[05] Mental Beat\n[06] Self Destruction Blues\n[07] Unitil I Get You\n[08] Lightnin' Bar Blues\n[09] Don't Follow Me\n[10] 11th Street Kids\n[11] M.C.
