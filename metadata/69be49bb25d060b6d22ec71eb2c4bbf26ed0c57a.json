Well, the track list anyway. The running order always depends on varying tempos, song keys and subject matter.\n\nIf you liked BourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and the Songs From The Wood record, you will love this Jethro Tull Christmas Album. The aim was to find some uplifting traditional Christmas Carols, some new songs and to re-record some old Tull pieces on the Christmas topic.\n\nAs I was working at the same time on a solo album, I had to off-load some of the studio production and sessions to other participants. Doane Perry did his drum stuff in LA while the UK sessions featured guest drummer James Duncan and, of course, Jonathan Noyce on bass. Ex bassist, Dave Pegg, dropped by to play on a couple of songs and Andrew Giddings used his studio to record his parts and Martin BarreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s overdubs. I then pulled it all together and mixed down the various line-ups and sessions in my studio at the last moment.\n\nMy views on Christmas? Well, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not exactly a practising paid-up Christian but I have grown up and lived with a so-called Christian society for 55 years and still feel great warmth for the nostalgia, festive occasion and family togetherness, so much a part of that time of year. Maybe without Christmas we would have that much less to celebrate and enjoy in this troubled old world. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really all the Winter Solstice and the re-birth of nature overlaid with the common sense and righteous teachings of Mr. C.\n\nA Christmas in this modern world should, in my view, accommodate the leisure needs and affections of Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, atheists and agnostics, as well as Fido the family dog and Felix the cat. Throw in a few lost cousins and that dreadful man from next door and you have it! Sip the sloe gin, pull a cracker (so long as sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the daughter of that dreadful man from next door), kiss and cuddle under the mistletoe, toss Vegan disciplines aside, gobble the turkey (steady on, now) and have a therapeutic respite from the rigours of daily life.\n\nChristmas - an aspirin for the soul or cold-turkey celebration of the birth and life of Christ? It has to be a measured bit of both, doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it?\n\nAnd, if you can cope with it, a Happy New Year.\n\nTracklist:\n01. Birthday Card at Christmas\n02. Holly Herald\n03.
