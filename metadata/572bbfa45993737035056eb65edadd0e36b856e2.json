This is a prime example of that phenomenon!\n\nAfter a smoking &quot;Hot'Lanta&quot; opener, the first &quot;Can't Lose What You Never Had&quot; of the Palace run showed the band was still expanding the setlist.  Gregg's voice is on point from the word go on this Muddy Waters classic.  The first set really caught fire with &quot;Rockin' Horse,&quot; an adventurous jam odyssey that delivered on every level.  &quot;Gambler's Roll&quot; and Dave Mason's &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot; (made famous by Delaney and Bonnie) were two more Palace debuts, and both sounded great!  &quot;Kind Of Bird&quot; came to life at this show, with Warren and Derek soaring above the music with incredibly creative playing, before &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot; wrapped up an epic first set!\n\nThe second set kicked off with a delicate &quot;Melissa&quot; before the bustout frenzy continued with the first &quot;Good Clean Fun&quot; of the run.  The extended version of &quot;Black Hearted Woman&quot; at this show crackles with energy and power, with the whole band combining to create a huge sound.  Check out Oteil on the bass! \n\n&quot;The Weight&quot; provided another Palace debut, and this version featured a slightly different arrangement and feel, once again showing the creativity and spontaneity the ABB have shown during this run.  &quot;Every Hungry Woman&quot; was nothing less than fierce, with a slightly different take on the closing jam.\n\nThis show will probably be most remembered for the epic &quot;Jessica&quot; that included a stirring version of &quot;Will The Circle Be Unbroken&quot; in the middle.  The Palace is a church most of the time, and the spirit was certainly flowing on this one!  After a bass solo with Oteil knocking it out of the park again, a beautiful &quot;Blue Sky&quot; jam led back into &quot;Jessica.&quot;  Absolute perfection!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:572bbfa45993737035056eb65edadd0e36b856e2","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F15%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"572bbfa45993737035056eb65edadd0e36b856e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,43,191,164,89,147,115,112,53,5,110,182,94,218,221,14,54,184,86,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
