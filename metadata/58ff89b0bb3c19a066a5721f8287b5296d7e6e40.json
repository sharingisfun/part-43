The entire\nsoundtrack contains 44 songs which most song fades oddly loop at 1.5 times (instead of the \nstandard 2 times) and is 63 Minutes. \n\nThis Complete and Restored version contains all 52 tracks and fades loop at the standard 2 \ntimes and is 1.6 hours and fits on 2 CDs.\n\nRestoration Process:\n\nNone of the 44 released tracks were re-recorded. These tracks that were re-edited and \nfades looped at the standard 2 times.\n\nUnreleased tracks were taken from the original SPC (SNES sound) files and recorded from a real SNES console.  \n\nSpecial thanks to Anti Resonance for his spc2rom and SWC Util for Super WildCard DX2 http://alpha-ii.com/\n\nSPCs were converted using SPC2ROM and then transferred directly to a Super Wildcard DX2 Copier and directly loaded in SNES memory.\n\nNo filers or NR were used, this is pure authentic SPC700 music that matches the OST! You should\nnot be able to tell our recordings from Square's.\n\nI am most proud of this project because FF4 is my personal fav. game and soundtrack. It is a\nshame that the OST release got screwed this way, but we managed to fix it :)\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58ff89b0bb3c19a066a5721f8287b5296d7e6e40","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+IV+SNES+OST+%5BCOMPLETE+%26+RESTORED%5D+%5BVX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58ff89b0bb3c19a066a5721f8287b5296d7e6e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,255,137,176,187,60,25,160,102,165,114,31,130,135,181,41,109,126,110,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
