However, the ripper didn't warn of any errors.\n\n\nRipped with RubyRipper and encoded to flac with ReplayGain. Log files within each folder.\n\n\n\nPlease don't forget to seed this for a while, after leeching it. Other people would also like to be able to have access to this, so don't be a greedy mofo and do care about the rest of the community. SHARE!! Thank you.\n\n\nMy shitty assymetric connection isn't quite bandwidth heaven but i'll let it pummell as fast as i can till some more people can help me seed it strong.\n\nHopefully, I'll share some other quality stuff soon enough. :)\n\n\n\nI'd also like to thank everyone who also shares whatever content, making it available for anyone anywhere in the world. Major props to every scene, individual, community, or whatever other word applies - kudos to you. This is the way to a better world, letting people have access to art, entertainment, tools, information, books, all for free. Fuck the corporate greedy bussinesses and industries. And yes, I do pay my tribute to the artists by attending their shows and paying the ticket fees, not by increasing their label's profits. ;) \n\n\nPeace, and good music.\nJohnny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab295305760335544a9acca26885b77530b8573","amp;dn":"Tom+Waits+5+records+flac+proper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab295305760335544a9acca26885b77530b8573","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,178,149,48,87,96,51,85,68,169,172,202,38,136,91,119,83,11,133,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
