Think of Carl Sagan's book Cosmos, only much older.\n\nThe torrent consists of about three hundred compressed 300DPI greyscale TIFF images.  If you want searchable plain text, wait for the Gutenberg version.  If you want to preserve the original over-the-top scan-ins, here you go.\n\nAs far as I know, this book is in the public domain.\n\nShare and enjoy!\nZoe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25f0016170c3d8123c06fb7248aafd3d3df5d1f9","amp;dn":"Walter+Libby%3A+An+Introduction+to+the+History+of+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25f0016170c3d8123c06fb7248aafd3d3df5d1f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,240,1,97,112,195,216,18,60,6,251,114,72,170,253,61,61,245,209,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
