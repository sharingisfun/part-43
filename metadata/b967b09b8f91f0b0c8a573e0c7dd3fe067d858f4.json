Here are three albums from Jamie Cullum, a cool young Jazz singer from UK. The albums included in this torrent are\n\n* TwentySomething (special edition) (p. 2004)\n* Catching Tales (p. 2005)\n* Sunday Express (p. 2006) - a sort of a compilation, but contains songs which no other CD has\n\nEnjoy and (of course) SEED! :)\nAnd share lossless music as much as possible ;)\n\nP.S. If somebody has his first two albums (&quot;Heard It All Before&quot; and &quot;Pointless Nostalgic&quot;) I'd really like to see them around here (in lossless format, of course).\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b967b09b8f91f0b0c8a573e0c7dd3fe067d858f4","amp;dn":"Jamie+Cullum+-+3+albums+%28FLAC%2C+lossless%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b967b09b8f91f0b0c8a573e0c7dd3fe067d858f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,103,176,155,143,145,240,176,200,165,115,224,199,221,63,224,103,216,88,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
