Counting back to one (3:57)\n02. Robots in Love (3:50)\n03. Super conducter (2:21)\n04. So long to U (4:05)\n05. Servo Manual Chapter 1 (Mandroids On Whiskey) (2:51)\n\n\nInto the Groove: Beautiful Small Machines are undoubtedly one of my favourite discoveries of 2009 so far. Check out all the songs on their MySpace, because there's not one track on there that I can't say I absolutely love!.\n\nThe Fleshy Fresh: They've created a refreshing, crisp sound that indie-lovers will enjoy as much as anyone who just listens for the hook.\n\nBattery in your leg: It's a bit like Grandaddy, The Postal Service and The Ting Tings forming a super band.\n\n\n\n--\nBrought to you by Dodecahedron. Enjoy and seed! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36192832b2b6d88176156a695ef08b9af1b2306a","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Small+Machines+-+Robots+in+Love+EP+%5B2009%5D+%28320+Kbps%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36192832b2b6d88176156a695ef08b9af1b2306a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,25,40,50,178,182,216,129,118,21,106,105,94,240,139,154,241,178,48,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
