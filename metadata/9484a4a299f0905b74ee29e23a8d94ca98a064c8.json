It arrived two and a half years after Linda's controversial Punk Rock Mad Love album. It was taken out of print in 2009.\n\nGet Closer found Ronstadt returning to the genres that had resulted in her commercial and critical success throughout the 1970s, and working again with British musician and producer Peter Asher. It was noted by critics that, whereas she had spent the '70s channeling the music of then-upcoming songwriters such as Warren Zevon, Elvis Costello, Karla Bonoff and J. D. Souther, on Get Closer Ronstadt sang older songs, some originated by established artists such as Billy Joe Royal, George Jones and Ike and Tina Turner, and others originated by lesser-known soul artists and one-hit wonders such as the Knickerbockers, the Exciters, Lee Dorsey and Wade Flemons.\n\nCommercially, the album fell short of Ronstadt's prior efforts, peaking at #31 on the Billboard album chart in late 1982 and being certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 500,000 copies. (By contrast, 1980's Mad Love had debuted in the Top Five and was certified Platinum in several weeks.) Get Closer was Ronstadt's first album release in 10 years to miss a million-selling Platinum certification although it reached sales of 900,000 copies.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;festival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Closer_(Linda_Ronstadt_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Closer_(Linda_Ronstadt_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dAehgAAdj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dAehgAAdj&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:37\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
