Even lesser-known tracks like the low-key pulse of &quot;Lie to Me&quot; \nand the weirdly dreamy &quot;It Doesn't Matter&quot; showcase an increasingly confident \nband. Alan Wilder's arrangements veer from the big to the stripped down, but \nalways with just the right touch, such as the crowd samples bubbling beneath \n&quot;Somebody&quot; or the call/response a cappella start to &quot;Master and Servant.&quot; With \nReward, David Gahan's singing style found the mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tier it was going to stick with \nfor the next ten years, and while it's never gone down well with some ears, it \nstill has a compelling edge to it that suits the material well. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome Great Reward is the fourth album by the British electronic group Depeche \nMode, released in 1984. The album peaked at #5 in the UK and at #54 in the US. \nThe title comes from a phrase used near the end of track 2, Lie to Me (&quot;Make me \nthink by the end of the day, some great reward will be coming my way&quot;).\n\nIn 2006, Some Great Reward was re-released with a bonus DVD. The CD was \nremastered and (except in the USA) was released on a CD/SACD hybrid. The bonus \nDVD includes the two B-side tracks &quot;In Your Memory&quot; and &quot;Set Me Free (Remotivate \nMe)&quot; in addition to &quot;Somebody (Remix)&quot; and several live versions of some of the \nsongs from the album. The DVD also includes a documentary on the making of the \nalbum.\n\nThe remastered album was released on &quot;deluxe&quot; vinyl in March 2007.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPEOPLE ARE PEOPLE     \tby Stewart Mason\n\nOriginally released as a stand-alone single in the U.K. in April 1984, &quot;People \nAre People&quot; ended up becoming Depeche Mode's U.S. breakthrough hit, getting \nenough MTV and club airplay that Sire Records ended up gathering a number of \nstray single tracks and remixes and releasing the stopgap People Are People LP \nin the States. (This made U.S. consumers feel slightly cheated a few months \nlater when &quot;People Are People&quot; showed up yet again on the Some Great Reward \nalbum.) It's ironic that this is the song that broke the group in the States as \nopposed to a poppier slice of synth pop like &quot;See You,&quot; because &quot;People Are \nPeople&quot; was the single that introduced Depeche Mode's next-level sound as the \ngroup that made industrial music (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Einsturzende Neubauten or Test Dept.) \npalatable to the masses: the song features samples of clanging pipes, shattering \nglass, and other sounds recorded by the group and engineer Gareth Jones at a \nGerman junkyard during the sessions for Construction Time Again, manipulated \ninto a deliberately choppy rhythm that emphasizes the beat to a considerably \nlarger extent than Depeche Mode's earlier singles. (The overall effect is oddly \nsimilar to the contemporaneous singles by the Art of Noise, particularly since \n&quot;People Are People&quot; also makes use of a Trevor Horn trademark, the Fairlight \norchestral stab.) Over this, the group repeatedly chants a sloganeering chorus, \nin between which Dave Gahan sings a well-intentioned but unfortunately trite set \nof lyrics about hatred and other bad vibes. Lyrically and musically, the song's \nsaving grace is a refrain sung by songwriter Martin Gore, whose lightweight \nvoice suits the lyrics' questioning tone better than Gahan's more strident \ndelivery. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOMEBODY     by Stewart Mason\n\nAlthough &quot;Somebody&quot; is one of Depeche Mode's most atypical songs, it's an all-\ntime fan favorite, remaining a key point of the group's live sets for the rest \nof its career. One of the few Depeche Mode songs sung by primary songwriter \nMartin Gore, &quot;Somebody&quot; is in fact basically a solo performance for the keyboard \nplayer, who sings the almost embarrassingly abject lyrics in a thin, weedy voice \nthat makes plain why he's not the band's primary singer. Cleverly, however, Gore \nhas his cake and eats it by turning himself (and the song as a whole) into a \njoke at the end of both verses, by inserting some self-protective sarcasm into \nlines like &quot;Though things like this make me sick/In a case like this, I'll get \naway with it.&quot; It's only because of that level of self-awareness that he does; \nwithout it, &quot;Somebody&quot; would make anyone past the age of 15 gag. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMASTER AND SERVANT     \tby Ned Raggett\n\nRight from the start, with its call-and-response vocals between Martin Gore and \nDavid Gahan (&quot;It's a lot -- it's a lot -- it's a lot -- like life!&quot;), &quot;Master \nand Servant&quot; shows Depeche plunging even more deeply into its self-created image \nof sexual/social renegades. Keep in mind that this is the same band that scored \nbig with &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; three years earlier -- and that it not only \nkept a pop audience with this song, but the single went number six in the band's \nhomeland. The gentle distortion on the harmony vocals, the crunches and synth \nmelodies, created via sampling as much metallic banging as the group could \nmanage, Gahan's echoed delivery of the often downright sadistic lyrics, and more \nall contribute to this being one of the more unlikely hit numbers around. That \nTrent Reznor, to name one of many people, listened to this on a regular basis \nwhen young is perfectly clear as the shuddering, massive beats punch the song \nalong. As always, Depeche know how to sugar the pill just enough, as with the \nquick synth shimmer that concludes the second verses, but as long as one can \nhear the screams and screeches littered throughout the mix, simple and sweet boy \nband pop this isn't. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4be212344458f567740607ded05d09e705b4929","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Some+Great+Reward+%28Remaster+2006%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BReP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4be212344458f567740607ded05d09e705b4929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,190,33,35,68,69,143,86,119,64,96,125,237,5,208,158,112,91,73,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
