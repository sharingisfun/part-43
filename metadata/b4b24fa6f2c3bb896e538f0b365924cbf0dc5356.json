The main protagonist is one-eyed patriarch\n Giacinto (Manfredi). Four generations of his sons and relatives are cramped together\n in his shack, managing to get by mainly on thieving and whoring, among other things\n more or less respectable.\nFor the loss of his eye, an insurance company has paid Giacinto a large sum.\n Moved by greed, the whole family (including his wife, who is enraged by Giacinto's\n bringing home a fat prostitute he has fallen in love with, and who has become his mistress)\n try to poison him in order to inherit the money. However, Giacinto survives.\n In a frenzy of anger, he sets fire to his home and shoots one of his sons with\n a hunting rifle (the son survives).\nIn the meantime Giacinto has sold the house to a Neapolitan immigrant family.\n The film ends with Giacinto living in a newly built exceedingly crowded shack\n with both his mistress and his wife, together with an apparently reconciliated\n family and the newcomers as well.\n\n===================================================================\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : BruttiSporchiCattivi.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 832 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat settings, BVOP            : 1\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                      : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nBit rate                         : 845 Kbps\nWidth                            : 704 pixels\nHeight                           : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.167\nStream size                      : 672 MiB (81%)\nWriting library                  : DivX 6.7.0 (UTC 2007-09-20)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 51mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : Front: C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\nStream size                      : 153 MiB (18%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4b24fa6f2c3bb896e538f0b365924cbf0dc5356","amp;dn":"BruttiSporchiCattivi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4b24fa6f2c3bb896e538f0b365924cbf0dc5356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,178,79,166,242,195,187,137,110,83,143,11,54,89,36,203,240,220,83,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
