Directed by Christopher Hansen and starring his brother and writing partner Geoffrey Hansen as Al Dean, Scrapple follows a summer in the life of ski bums in the fictional town of Ajax, Colorado.\n\nOther stars include Buck Simmonds (Tom Sullivan), who had a part in A River Runs Through It opposite his former roommate, Brad Pitt; the beautiful Ryan Massey (Beth Muller) as Tom's unlucky girlfriend; and a curious pig called Scrapple, after the Pennsylvania pork delicacy. The latter character, and the many drug references, earned Scrapple the tagline &quot;Babe on Acid.&quot;\n\nScrapple features an impressive soundtrack of mostly 1960s and 1970s music. Veteran blues artist Taj Mahal produced the soundtrack, rerecorded versions of his favorite songs, and added some original incidental music.&quot;\n\n\nAccording to IMdb:\n\nDirected by\nChristopher Hanson\t \t\n \nWriting credits\n(in alphabetical order)\nChristopher Hanson\t \t writer\nGeoffrey Hanson\t \t writer\nSean McNamara\t \t story &quot;Spam&quot;\nGeorge Plamondon\t \t writer\n\nCast (in credits order)\n\nRyan Massey\t ...\tBeth Muller, Tom's Girlfriend\n\tL.
