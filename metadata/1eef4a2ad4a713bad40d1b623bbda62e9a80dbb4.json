The band was featured on Ryan Adams and the Cardinals albums Cold Roses, Jacksonville City Nights, Follow the Lights, and Cardinology. Though credited as a solo Ryan Adams release, the 2007 album Easy Tiger also features the Cardinals.\n\nRegarding the band's name, Adams states that he &quot;suggested the Cardinals because it was my high school football team.&quot;\n\nAlong with their work with Adams, The Cardinals recorded an album with Willie Nelson in 2006, and following Adams' departure in 2009, The Cardinals recorded an album with singer-songwriter Gin Wigmore.\n\nPerformers:\n\n* Ryan Adams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals, Guitar\n* Neal Casal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar, vocals\n* Jon Graboff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Steel guitar\n* Brad Pemberton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\n* Catherine Popper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass guitar\n* Jamie Candiloro - Piano, synths\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Adams_and_The_Cardinals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Adams_and_The_Cardinals&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nRyan Adams &amp; The Cardinals - III-IV CD1\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Breakdown Into The Resolve\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Dear Candy\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Wasteland\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Ultraviolet Light\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Stop Playing With My Heart\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Lovely And Blue\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Happy Birthday\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kisses Start Wars\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Crystal Skull\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Users\n\n\n\n\nRyan Adams &amp; The Cardinals - III-IV CD2\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ No\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Numbers\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Gracie\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Icebreaker\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sewers At The Bottom Of The Wishing Well\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Typecast\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Star Wars\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ My Favorite Song\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ P.S.\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Death And Rats\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kill The Lights\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n- http://paxamrecords.com/\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Adams\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Adams_and_The_Cardinals\n\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinals_III/IV\n\n\n\nAS ALWAYS: ENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n\n\n\n\nMP3 VERSIONINCLUDINGLOTS AND LOTS OF EXTRAS CAN BE FOUND HERE:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6052228/%28FIXED%29_Ryan_Adams__amp__The_Cardinals_-_III-IV__amp__III-IV_Live__amp__Demo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6052228/%28FIXED%29_Ryan_Adams__amp__The_Cardinals_-_III-IV__amp__III-IV_Live__amp__Demo&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eef4a2ad4a713bad40d1b623bbda62e9a80dbb4","amp;dn":"Ryan+Adams+%26+The+Cardinals+-+III-IV+%282010%29%282CD%29%28Indie+Folk+Rock+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eef4a2ad4a713bad40d1b623bbda62e9a80dbb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,239,74,42,212,167,19,186,212,13,27,98,59,189,166,46,154,128,219,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
