While there are a couple of self-penned tunes here--including Dan Dean's humble and reverent &quot;Pour My Love on You&quot;--the trio pulls material mostly from today's top praise-and-worship writers like Matt Redman and Paul Baloche. The group's classic three-part harmonies soar on the choruses of &quot;Come, Now Is the Time to Worship&quot; and Baloche's &quot;Open the Eyes of My Heart.&quot; You'll also enjoy the pulsating rhythms of &quot;Let Everything That Has Breath,&quot; punctuated by a nifty horn section. Otherwise, listeners will find the trio offering standard and steady readings of worshipful devotions done in the quality style so typical of Phillips, Craig, and Dean.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56eae9ec955c3f5355f1ad913613b77decc6fa40","amp;dn":"Phillips%2C+Craig+And+Dean+-+2001+-+Let+My+Words+Be+Few","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56eae9ec955c3f5355f1ad913613b77decc6fa40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,234,233,236,149,92,63,83,85,241,173,145,54,19,183,125,236,198,250,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
