The story was originally serialized in Charles Dickens' magazine All the Year Round. The Moonstone and The Woman in White are considered Wilkie Collins' best novels. Besides creating many of the characteristics of detective novels, The Moonstone also represented Collins' social opinions by his treatment of the Indians and the servants in the novel. Collins adapted The Moonstone for the stage during 1877, but the production was performed for only two months.\n\n\n1979\nThe Moonstone - 01 of 06 \nThe Moonstone - 02 of 06 \nThe Moonstone - 03 of 06 \nThe Moonstone - 04 of 06 \nThe Moonstone - 05 of 06 \nThe Moonstone - 06 of 06 \n\n\n2011\nThe Moonstone - Part 01 of 04 \nThe Moonstone - Part 02 of 04 \nThe Moonstone - Part 03 of 04 \nThe Moonstone - Part 04 of 04 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 58mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n.\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbc916dac82086308c9e4e37d1f44e968a9b913c","amp;dn":"Wilkie+Collins+-+The+Moonstone+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbc916dac82086308c9e4e37d1f44e968a9b913c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,201,22,218,200,32,134,48,140,158,78,55,209,244,78,150,138,155,145,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
