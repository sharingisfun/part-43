In addition, there is one number from 1965, originally included on the sampler The New Wave in Jazz, and a previously unissued (and incomplete) &quot;Universal Thoughts&quot; from the 1967 date, one of the very few examples of Ayler using a trombonist (the forgotten George Steele). Taken as a whole, these are among the most rewarding recordings that the controversial Ayler ever made. They will not convince detractors of the radical saxophonist's music but they are more accessible than much of his music. Teamed up with brother Donald Ayler on trumpet, violinist Michel Sampson, occasional cellist Joel Freedman, two bassists (Bill Fowell and either Henry Grimes or Alan Silva), and drummer Beaver Harris, Ayler uses simple march-like melodies, which could have come from 1905, as the basis for his improvisations, which often become quite violent. Among the pieces are &quot;Truth Is Marching In,&quot; &quot;Spirits Rejoice,&quot; &quot;Angels&quot; (an Albert Ayler duet with pianist Call Cobbs), &quot;For John Coltrane,&quot; and &quot;Change Has Come.&quot; Donald Ayler's bugle-like fanfares and the droning violin certainly make the ensemble's sound quite unique.\n\nTracklisting:\n1-1 Holy Ghost (7:41) (Bass - Lewis Worrell; Drums - Sunny Murray; Engineer - Rudy Van Gelder)\n1-2 Truth Is Marching In (12:42)\n1-3 Our Prayer (4:45) (Composed By - Don Ayler*)\n1-4 Spirits Rejoice (16:22)\n1-5 Divine Peacemaker (12:37)\n1-6 Angels (9:53) (Piano - Call Cobbs Jr.*)\n2-1 For John Coltrane (13:40)\n2-2 Change Has Come (6:24)\n2-3 Light In Darkness (10:59)\n2-4 Heavenly Home (8:51)\n2-5 Spiritual Rebirth (4:26)\n2-6 Infinite Spirit (6:37)\n2-7 Omega Is The Alpha (10:46)\n2-8 Univeral Thoughts (8:22) (Trombone - George Steele)\n\nrtwork By [Art Direction] - Hollis A.
