This &quot;hits&quot; compilation skims the cream of her commercial achievements during this prolific period in her career. Though there are only 10 tracks, these include landmark No. 1 singles like &quot;You Lie,&quot; &quot;Fancy,&quot; &quot;Is There Life out There,&quot; and &quot;Does He Love You,&quot; a heartfelt duet with Linda Davis. ~ Bob Allen \n\nAlthough this album could have had more songs on it (especially from the 1988 &quot;Reba&quot; album), this is a true Greatest Hits classic. With new songs such as &quot;Does He Love You&quot; and &quot;They Asked About You&quot;, this package goes to show the new and upcoming country stars that Reba has been doing this since they were in diapers and she will continue to sing and outsell them for decades to come. ~ A Customer, Amazon\n\nReba McEntire is a legend. She has a true talent for choosing songs that speak to the listener. She's never, to my knowledge, had to remove her foot from her mouth or lost CD sales for being an idiot. She's true to country and true to good old-fashioned American values. This CD is excellent. There isn't a bad song on it. It's solid and true . . . just like Reba! ~ Country Girl\n\nReba McEntire - Greatest Hits Vol 2 Tracks:\n01 Does He Love You 4:20    \n02 You Lie 3:59    \n03 Fancy 4:58    \n04 For My Broken Heart 3:35    \n05 Love Will Find Its Way To You 3:38    \n06 They Asked About You 3:17    \n07 Is There Life Out There 3:11    \n08 Rumor Has It 3:47    \n09 Walk On 3:15    \n10 The Greatest Man I Never Knew 3:16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c324b502ba809db2d416b0275d0e0d8d6803302b","amp;dn":"Reba+McEntire+-+Greatest+Hits+Vol+2+%281993%29+%5BCountry%5D%5Bflac%5D%5Bschon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c324b502ba809db2d416b0275d0e0d8d6803302b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,36,181,2,186,128,157,178,212,22,176,39,93,14,13,141,104,3,48,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
