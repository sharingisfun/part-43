'I've Been Losing You', 'Blood that Moves the Body', \n'Manhattan Skyline', 'The Living Daylights', 'Train of Thought' and their \ncover of 'Crying in the Rain' are wonderful tunes as well, and A-ha are \nwell known for their looser pop music like 'Touchy!'and 'You Are the One'. \n\nTheir later material like 'I Call Your Name', 'Early Morning' and 'Move to \nMemphis' is brilliantly diverse, and a sign that they were not a band who \nwere typecast by a particular sound.\n_________________________\n\n1.
