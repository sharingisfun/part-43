Yet despite the efforts of the ANH, the NHF and the Dr. Rath Foundation the Codex agenda lumbers ever closer to the EU statute books.\n\nIn April of 2005, the ANH mounted a legal challenge to the Codex Commission; Justice Leendert A Geelhoed, the European Union Advocate General, refered to the arbitrary powers of the Codex-supporting EU legislation as being &quot;about as transparent as a black box&quot;.  \n\nThe subsequent 12th July 2005 ruling of the International Court of Justice in Luxembourg followed the July 4th Rome meeting of Codex when the 85 countries present ratified the restrictive guidelines for dietary supplements. Six days after London was awarded the 2012 Olympics and just five days after the London Bombings, there was little mention of the ICJ ruling in the British media.  \n\nAmongst the most disturbing component contained within Article 6 of the EU Directive, is that it strictly prohibits information about diseases being treatable by nutrients and calls for future supplement dosage restrictions.\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED.
