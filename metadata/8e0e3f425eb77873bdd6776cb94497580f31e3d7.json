It contains twelve tracks recorded during the Manchester leg of their Present for Everyone tour, plus the studio version of &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go!&quot;, which had been released as a stand-alone single in July 2004.\n\nThe album contains live versions of all nine of their British singles, including both tracks from the double A-side &quot;3am/Thunderbirds&quot;, and &quot;She Wants to Be Me&quot;, which was issued in its original form three weeks after this album. A cover of the 1978 Undertones song &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; and the Present for Everyone album track &quot;That Thing You Do&quot; round out the album.\n\nBourne, Simpson and Willis were augmented by Chris Banks, Damon Wilson and Chris Leonard.\n\nUnlike their two studio albums, A Ticket for Everyone was only a minor hit on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 11. Busted officially split up two months after its release.\n\nThe album went Platinum in the UK.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Air Hostess\n[02] That Thing You Do\n[03] What I Go To School For\n[04] She Wants To Be Me\n[05] 3am\n[06] Whos David\n[07] Thunderbirds Are Go\n[08] Teenage Kicks\n[09] You Said No\n[10] 3000\n[11] Sleeping With The Light On\n[12] Crashed The Wedding\n[13] Thunderbirds Are Go [Studio Version]\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time \t- 00h:49m:55s\n\nTotal File Size \t\t- 123mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size  \t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type \t\t- I-Tunes v8.1.1.10 MP3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format\t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nRelease Date\t\t- 01 November 2004\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Island Records\n\nArtists WebSite\t\t- http://www.busted.com\n\t\t\t-\n-\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0e3f425eb77873bdd6776cb94497580f31e3d7","amp;dn":"%5B2004%5D+A+Ticket+For+Everyone+%5BLive%5D+-+Busted+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e0e3f425eb77873bdd6776cb94497580f31e3d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,14,63,66,94,183,120,115,189,214,119,108,185,68,151,88,15,49,227,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
