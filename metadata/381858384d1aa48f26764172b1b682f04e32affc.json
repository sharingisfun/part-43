For years, his people had been exploited as energy sources by a cruel race known as the Macrolatts.  When the Macrolatts sought to bridge the dimensional gap and attack other realms, The Weird knew he had to act. Escaping through a portal to another world, The Weird found himself on the planet Earth.\n\nSeeking a corporeal form to contain his energy, he possessed the body of a dead man named Walter Langley. This produced a composite form which contained both The Weird's memories and traces of Langley's. In this shape, he sought out Earth's superheroes for aid and was dubbed &quot;The Weird&quot; by the Blue Beetle. \n\nThe Weird next appearance would be in Mystery in Space v2 along with Captain Comet.\n\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:381858384d1aa48f26764172b1b682f04e32affc","amp;dn":"The+Weird+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"381858384d1aa48f26764172b1b682f04e32affc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,24,88,56,77,26,164,143,38,118,65,114,177,182,130,240,78,50,175,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
