Directed by George Cukor, it was notorious as one of the most famous unsuccessful movies of the 1930s. Hepburn plays the title role of Sylvia Scarlett, a female con artist masquerading as a boy to escape the police. The success of the subterfuge is in large part due to the transformation of Hepburn by RKO make-up artist Mel Berns.\n\nThis film was the first pairing of Grant and Hepburn, who later starred together in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Holiday (1938), and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Cary Grant's performance as dashing rogue incorporates him using a Cockney accent and remains widely considered the first time Grant's famous personality began to register on film. (The only other film in which Grant used the Cockney accent is Clifford Odets' None but the Lonely Heart nine years later.) Cockney was not, however, Cary Grant's original accent. He was born and grew up in Bristol, which has a very different accent from that of London.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16acd6faa2480369dc4547596aaf40f28ce297eb","amp;dn":"Sylvia_Scarlett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16acd6faa2480369dc4547596aaf40f28ce297eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,172,214,250,162,72,3,105,220,69,71,89,106,175,64,242,140,226,151,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
