While camping, Scooby and Shaggy are selected by the group to gather more wood for the fire. While out looking for wood, Scooby mistakenly tried to gather the horns of a stag. Frighten by noises they hear, they hide, only to see the Joker, the Penguin and Professor Flakey walking by. They try to run away and are captured by the Batplane's bat cage. When Batman and Robin land, they tell Scooby that Professor Flakey disappeared that morning from his home and they were searching for him. Their radar had detected movement in the forest, so Batman and Robin had dropped their bat cage in an attempt to capture the Penguin and Joker but instead they captured Scooby and Shaggy. The dastardly criminals have a scheme to steal Professor Flakey's untested new invention, the &quot;flying suit.&quot; The Scooby, Mystery, Inc. group is solicited to help look for the Professor and they are to signal Batman and Robin if they find anything. The Penguin's and the Joker's scheme is finally foiled by Scooby, his friends (Scooby, Mystery, Inc.) and the dynamic duo.
