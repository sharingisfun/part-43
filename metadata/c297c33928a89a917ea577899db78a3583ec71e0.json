Now she knows.\n\n\nThese Torrents are currently on a Free Leech  --  High Speed Server\n\nPOtHS - Chuck Missler - The Beyond Collection\n\nIf you are or you know a non-believer that loves Science, Math and Statistics, you need to See this presentation. Missler is by FAR the Most &quot;Educated in many fields&quot; Bible Teacher there is. He speaks Hebrew and Greek which gives him an understanding of the Bible that few preachers get a grip on. He graduated from The Navel Academy and had a remarkable tour through Corporate America for 30 years. Missler is The Smartest Man I can Understand.\n\nAn understanding of the reality in which we live can only be accomplished with a thorough understanding of God's Word. Every discipline of science is coming &quot;full circle&quot; back to what the Bible has said all along. This collection of studies includes:\n\nBeyond Time and Space -  The startling discovery of modern science is that our physical universe is actually finite.\n\nBeyond Coincidence - The slightest change in any one of many variables prevents life.\n\nBeyond Perception -  The implication of quantum mechanics is frightening to secular scientists.\n\nBeyond Newton - The interaction of the heavenly bodies cannot be explained by gravity.\n\nThese DVD's includes notes in PDF format and MP3 files.\n\nEncoding: ( Very Happy ) :Divx\nFormat: Color, Fullscreen\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nAudio Encoding: Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo\nRun Time: 8 hour(s)\nNumber of discs: 4\n\n\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\n\nThis is what is coming and more.\nIf you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.\n\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 01 - Woodmaster Survival Skills\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 02 - The Edible Garden\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 03 - Ray Mears - World of Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 04 - Ray Mears - Country Tracks\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 05 - Ray Mears - Extreme Survival\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 06 - Ray Mears - Real Heroes of Telemark\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 07 - Ray Mears - Bushcraft Series\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 08 - Ray Mears - Wild Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 09 - 50 Outdoor Skills ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Basic\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 10 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 11 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE2\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 12 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE3\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 13 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE4\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 14 - Man vs Wild - Bear Grylis - SE5\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 15 - Growing Your Own Food\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 16 - Growing Your Own Drugs\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 17 - Permaculture and Organic Gardening\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 18 - Old McDonalds Backyard Farm\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 19 - First Aid - Includes Gunshot Wounds\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 20 - Make you own Electricity\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 21 - More Food Farming\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 22 - Pure Water for Life\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 23 - Self Defense - Easy Stuff for Beginners\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 24 - Self Defense - Street Survival &amp; Hapkido Self-Defense\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 25 - Self Defense - Krav Mag\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 26 - Firearm Tactics 2.1\nPOtHS - Survival Series - Part 27 - Gracie - Bully Proof\n\n\nMore Torrents in this series at          ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
