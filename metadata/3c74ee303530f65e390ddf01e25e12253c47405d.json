As with all screeners they are flat in colors and sharpness and yes it has the logos\n. It would had taken to much time to blur and really makes the pic worse since it has 2 bottom of the screen and right hand corner. Also they are always interlaced to so took care of that also.\n\ncredit FLAWL3SS &amp; BDK &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, xxxUniversalAbsurdityxxx, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE even the CRITICIZERS :)\n\n*****help what we can with haiti or any other in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c74ee303530f65e390ddf01e25e12253c47405d","amp;dn":"The+Back-up+Plan+DvD+Scr+XviD+AC3-FLAWL3SS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c74ee303530f65e390ddf01e25e12253c47405d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,116,238,48,53,48,246,94,57,13,223,1,226,94,18,37,60,71,64,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
