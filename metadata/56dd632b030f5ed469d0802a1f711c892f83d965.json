Their first album Araban earned a cult status at US college radio. The next single Red Hot Navigator became a radio hit in Holland, their second album Hasheeda lingered in the Dutch Album Top 100 for weeks and even topped HollandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leading music magazine OORÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“moordlijstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Glorious shows at Lowlands festival and Pinkpop proved their triumph is no accident.\n\nSuccess has not kept the musical cowboys from day-to-day rehearsals in order to excel in front of you as the best and most playing band of this moment. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good thing too, because a concert by these Amsterdam guys is an experience you are bound to remember for a long time. Their music is rebellious, and as mysterious as the swamps of Sumatra, and expresses the mysticism of the American Indians. One moment you find yourself on a surf board in Waimea Bay, the next you are in a seedy night club in Casablanca in 1942. Several guest musicians and other surprise elements cause a Treble SpankersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ show to be even more exciting.\n\nThese musical omnivores donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t care a rap for trends and externals. They provided magnificent songs by diverse artists such as Kraftwerk, Herb Alpert and 2 Unlimited with new energy. Casually, they added a few classics to music history by means of their own brilliant compositions.\n\nThe Treble Spankers are the already legendary Marcel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SupermodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Kruup (rhythm guitar), Frank Sloos (a hypnotizing drummer), Maarten Heijblok (bass) and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“PhantomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Frank Gerritsen, who not only makes his guitar jump around like Jimi Hendrix in a pinball machine but can also make it sound like a macho flamenco singer from Andalusia. Be sure you get to see The Treble Spankers before they conquer the world!\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nMarcel Kruup (rhythm guitar), \nFrank Sloos (drums), \nMaarten Heijblok (bass) \nFrank Gerritsen (guitar)\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - Red Hot Navigator \n02 - Jaa-Rabbi \n03 - Me JirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©vis \n04 - Popcorn \n05 - Wella Flex Blue \n06 - Laguna Beach \n07 - Hasheeda \n08 - I Follow The Sun \n09 - A Man Called Curse \n10 - Toenggoe Mati \n11 - Memories Of Madrid \n12 - Samira \n13 - Vahim \n14 - Biarritz 2000\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56dd632b030f5ed469d0802a1f711c892f83d965","amp;dn":"Treble+Spankers+-+Hasheeda++%5B1995%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56dd632b030f5ed469d0802a1f711c892f83d965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,221,99,43,3,15,94,212,105,208,128,42,31,113,28,137,47,131,217,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
