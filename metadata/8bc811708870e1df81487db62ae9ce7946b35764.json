Other than keeping his parents employed, however, Mr. Black's BLACK BOX has done nothing for 11-year-old Toe Thompson, who just wants to make a few friends...until a mysterious rainbow-colored rock falls from the sky, hits him in the head and changes everything. The Rainbow Rock does Mr. Black's BLACK BOX one better: it grants wishes to anyone who holds it. Before long, wishes-gone-wrong have left the neighborhood swarming with tiny spaceships, crocodile armies, giant boogers...and outrageous magical mayhem around every corner.\n\nSample included","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bc811708870e1df81487db62ae9ce7946b35764","amp;dn":"Shorts+XviD+TS-Fatal%5Bmoviefoxorg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bc811708870e1df81487db62ae9ce7946b35764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,200,17,112,136,112,225,223,129,72,125,182,42,233,206,121,70,179,87,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
