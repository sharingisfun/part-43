In random attacks, he is known to have \nmurdered six persons; in a series of letters to newspapers, which sometimes \nincluded cryptograms, he boasted of many more. To this day, the infamous \ncase remains unsolved and surprisingly little has been written about \nit. Graysmith, a San Francisco Chronicle staff member, was obsessed \nwith the case from the beginning and he has continued to investigate \nit as an amateur sleuth. Except for &quot;Zodiac&quot; himself, the author now \nknows more about the case than anyone. In this full, chronological account, \nwhich will fascinate true crime readers, he speculates about the most \nlikely suspect.\n\n&quot;SHE WAS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT NOW SHE IS BATTERED AND DEAD. SHE IS \nNOT THE FIRST AND SHE WILL NOT BE THE LAST.&quot; Few cases in the history \nof true crime are as colorful and intriguing as that of Zodiac, the \nbizarre gunman in an executioner's hood who hunted the streets of San \nFrancisco in the late 1960s and sent dozens of taunting letters to the \npolice. Robert Graysmith provides ample details about the police investigation, \nincluding the full text and photos of most of the letters. Zodiac is \nan excellent starting point not only for the casual reader, but also \nfor those interested in retracing the author's steps in order to pursue \ntheir own ideas about who the killer may have been. This book has been \npraised by the San Francisco Chronicle, the very paper in which the \nZodiac's eerie messages and cryptograms were published: &quot;Graysmith's \ntaut narrative brings the horror back with jolt upon jolt.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65a4bb189ea444866a7f3c34c2d5081bd69e0ede","amp;dn":"Zodiac+-+by+Robert+Graysmith+-+The+True+Shocking+Story+of+the+Na","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65a4bb189ea444866a7f3c34c2d5081bd69e0ede","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,164,187,24,158,164,68,134,106,127,60,52,194,213,8,27,214,158,14,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
