I'm Waiting for the Man\n3. Femme Fatale\n4. Venus in Furs\n5. Run Run Run\n6. All Tomorrow's Parties\n7. Heroin\n8. There She Goes Again\n9. I'll Be Your Mirror\n10. The Black Angel's Death Song\n11. European Son\n12. Heroin (alt. version)\n\nSunday Morning: For this first edition, after lengthy deliberation and coming close to covering Digital Underground's Sex Packets, all present voted in favor of the 'other' Underground's The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. Participants included this time around are Nigel Godrich, Joey Waronker, Brian Lebarton, Bram Inscore, Yo, Giovanni Ribisi, Chris Holmes, and from Iceland, special guest Thorunn Magnusdottir, and myself. Thanks to everyone who helped put this together, and to all of you for indulging in this experiment. More soon.\n\nI'm Waiting For The Man: Here is the second song from 'The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico', in which everyone untunes their instruments and nigel thrashes a dx-7, coaxing sounds hitherto unheard from the 80's power ballad beast.\n\nVenus In Furs: Possibly one of the first, if not the first goth song ever? For the occasion, we dragged out the sitar, Nigel took a bow to his white SG and Joey played a flute bought on the street in Japan fondly referred to as 'The Dying Goose.'\n\nAll Tomorrow's Parties: This week, our Icelandic friend Thorunn takes lead vocal duties for 'All Tomorrow's Parties,' while Joey plays drums and casio at the same time and Chris happens upon a lute.\n\nHeroin: Brian does a simultaneous Mo Tucker and Lou Reed, playing drums and singing with a little help from Nigel.\n\nEuropean Son: This week's track is the last installment of the first Record Club series. Thanks again to all who participated. The next Record Club featuring Devendra Banhart, MGMT, Wolfmother and Little Joy will kick off next week.\n\nHeroin (alt. version): Before we close out Record Club 1, we have a surprise extra track--- an alternate version of Heroin. The second Record Club convenes later this week on thursday with Devendra Banhart and MGMT.\n\n\n=========================\n\n\nThis torrent includes the original .mp4 video files posted on Beck's vimeo.com site (http://www.vimeo.com/videotheque). They were ripped with clipnabber.com and are the original files uploaded by Beck, not the vimeo stream, not the vimeo re-encode.\n\nThe flac and mp3's, therefore, are clean rips from the best possible available source (the original mp4 videos) and are not sourced from the vimeo stream or the re-encoded / compressed vimeo files.\n\nEnjoy this in the highest quality available until Beck officially releases it, if he does.\n\n- RandyB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:915d7b4b0524da2af18ce102a3a50c4d3550aeba","amp;dn":"Beck+-+Record+Club+1+-+The+Velvet+Underground+%26+Nico+%28MP4%2C+MP3%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"915d7b4b0524da2af18ce102a3a50c4d3550aeba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,93,123,75,5,36,218,42,241,140,225,2,163,165,12,77,53,80,174,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
