Comic book legends Jack Kirby and Gil Kane contributed to the design and concepts of the show.\n\nIn the near future, an evil genius, the cyborg Doc Terror, seeks to conquer the earth; he is assisted by Hacker, his cyborg sidekick and an army of Doom Drones.\nAt each turn their evil plans are thwarted by the heroic Centurions.  The Centurions are a team of men dressed in specially created exo-frames that allow them to fuse with 'incredible' assault weapon systems.  The end result is a weapons platform somewhere between a hard-suit and a mecha.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31f3bfc115abd4ba992f65402d8651b729d8fd1","amp;dn":"Centurions+%28DC+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31f3bfc115abd4ba992f65402d8651b729d8fd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,31,59,252,17,90,189,75,169,146,246,84,2,216,101,27,114,157,143,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
