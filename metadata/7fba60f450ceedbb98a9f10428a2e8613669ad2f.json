And beyond the\n\noccurrences there is something about the house which gnaws at Becket\n\n- some strange connection he senses he has with the house's past.\n\nSoon, the haunting turns personal, he hears voices suggesting clues\n\nto a deep mystery. He questions his sanity, seeks medical help, but\n\ninstead finds assistance in a young psychic who immediately declares,\n\n&quot;There's a very bad secret in this house.&quot; Together they embark on a\n\nterrifying journey to uncover the secret - a journey which leads them\n\ndeep into the recesses of The Skeptic's own troubled mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fba60f450ceedbb98a9f10428a2e8613669ad2f","amp;dn":"The.Skeptic.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-DoNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fba60f450ceedbb98a9f10428a2e8613669ad2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,186,96,244,80,206,237,187,152,169,241,4,40,162,232,97,54,105,173,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
