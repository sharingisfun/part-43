Each chapter outlines the strengths and limitations of specific numerical or technological approaches, and ultimately applies the chosen method to a real fossil dataset or sample type. A unifying theme throughout the book is the evaluation of fossils during the prologue and epilogue of one of the most exciting events in Earth History: the Cambrian radiation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0c216e46e49ccbd46c71b68ca402430e20f360","amp;dn":"Quantifying+the+Evolution+of+Early+Life%3A+Numerical+Approaches+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0c216e46e49ccbd46c71b68ca402430e20f360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,12,33,110,70,228,156,203,212,108,113,182,140,164,2,67,14,32,243,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
