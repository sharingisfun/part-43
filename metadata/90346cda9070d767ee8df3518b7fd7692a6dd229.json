He sang in opera houses in The Netherlands, Vienna, London, Ankara, Budapest and Barcelona. The young tenor earned valuable experience and recognition while touring Australia at the invitation of soprano Joan Sutherland in 1965. He made his US debut in Miami soon afterwards, also on Sutherland's recommendation. His position as a leading lyric tenor was consolidated in the years between 1966 and 1972, during which time he first appeared at Milan's La Scala and other major European houses. In 1968, he debuted at New York City's Metropolitan Opera as Rudolfo in Puccini's La BohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me. At the Met in 1972, in the role of Tonio in Donizetti &quot;La Fille du RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©giment&quot; he earned the title &quot;King of the high C's&quot; when he sang the aria &quot;Ah mes amis ... pour mon ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢me&quot;. He gained worldwide fame for the brilliance and beauty of his tone, especially into the upper register. He was at his best in bel canto operas, pre-Aida Verdi roles and Puccini works such as La BohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨me, Tosca and Madama Butterfly. The late 1970s and 1980s saw Pavarotti continue to make significant appearances in the world's foremost opera houses.\n\nCelebrity beyond the world of opera came to Pavarotti at the 1990 World Cup in Italy with performances of Puccini's Nessun Dorma,Nessun Dorma from Turandot, and as one of &quot;The Three Tenors&quot; in their famed first concert held on the eve of the tournament's final match. He sang on that occasion with fellow star tenors PlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cido Domingo and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Carreras, bringing opera highlights to a wider audience. Appearances in advertisements and with pop icons in concerts furthered his international celebrity.\n\nHis final performance in an opera was at the Metropolitan in March 2004. The 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, saw him on stage for the last time, where Pavarotti performed Nessun dorma, with the crowd serving as the aria's chorus, and he received a thunderous standing ovation. On Thursday 6 September 2007, he died at home in Modena from pancreatic cancer, aged 71.\n\nHe made numerous recordings of complete operas and individual arias, and established himself as one of the finest tenors of the 20th century.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
