The Clash in England, and in The Netherlands, The Flying' Spiderz did the same, this becoming the first punk band. In the punk days they released two albums and various 7&quot;s, and had a fierce live reputation. They were dumped by EMI and the band dropped the name Flying and just became The Spiderz. This post is their first album (or third) 'Pressure', when the band progressed into a more power pop/new wave sort of sound. It's produced by Laurie Latham. \n\n A1 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Do You Feel The Pressure\n A2 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Not Sensitive \n A3 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  I Wanna Be Used For Love\n A4 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  I Want To Believe\n A5 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Shake Your Head \n A6 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  The Fall\n B1 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Birthday\n B2 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  At Night I Call Your Name\n B3 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  Let's Stick To Dancing\n B4 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  I'm Yours Tonight\n B5 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â  She's A Teaser \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef4f6adb1eac3917a7baaf8500bc562127c8e4c9","amp;dn":"The+Spiderz+-+Pressure+%281979%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef4f6adb1eac3917a7baaf8500bc562127c8e4c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,79,106,219,30,172,57,23,167,186,175,133,0,188,86,33,39,200,228,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
