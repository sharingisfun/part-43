ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a nice place to visit, but you wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to live there. Part monologue and part telephone conversation, WireTap ushers you into the endearingly odd, funny universe of JonathanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friends and family. The Montreal Gazette calls the show &quot;something between borscht-belt comedy and Franz Kafka&quot; and the Toronto Star describes it as &quot;[pitting] the absurd against the plausible. The sense is of a world not completely unlike our own that runs parallel... conversation, storytelling and introspection, culled from equal parts real-world experience and the warp of Goldstein's imagination.&quot; WireTap was awarded the Gold World Medal for Best Regularly Scheduled Comedy Program at The New York Festivals in 2006.\n\nWireTap is produced by Jonathan Goldstein, with Mira Burt-Wintonick and Carolyn Warren, and with production assistance from Cristal Duhaime.\n\nThis is the COMPLETE 26 episodes from Season Six of WireTap.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:654c09e7944dd98c9a394b6575f67edba34b431a","amp;dn":"CBC+Radio+WireTap+Season+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"654c09e7944dd98c9a394b6575f67edba34b431a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,76,9,231,148,77,217,140,154,57,75,101,117,246,126,219,163,75,67,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
