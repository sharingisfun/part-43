Boog (Martin Lawrence) is a domesticated Grizzly Bear who leads a perfectly happy life inside of Park Ranger Beth's (Debra Messing) garage, but a chance meeting with an overly energetic mule deer named Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) quickly changes everything and lands Boog high in the forest a few days before the opening of hunting season. Devoid of even the most basic survival skills, Boog and Elliot stumble through the woods and find themselves at the mercy of every forest animal from skunks to chipmunks as well as an evil hunter named Shaw (Gary Sinise). After unintentionally inciting and endangering an entire forest full of clever animals, Boog and Elliot come to the realization that only by banding together do the forest animals stand a chance of outsmarting the hunters and ensuring their own survival.\n\nGenres: Adventure / Animation / Comedy / Family\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0dcc5c9e41b78ae63daf358c30d3c49234c284f","amp;dn":"Open+Season.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0dcc5c9e41b78ae63daf358c30d3c49234c284f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,220,197,201,228,27,120,174,99,218,243,88,195,13,60,73,35,76,40,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
