Its valuable content is in an accessible format. In three comprehensive volumes and approximately 2,000 A-to-Z entries, this definitive resource pres more thorough, complete coverage than any other encyclopedia. Each entry pres an at-a-glance look at the war in question and a narrative discussion of the war, examining its social context, major battles and events, and broader significance in cultural and historical terms. Suggestions for further reading follow each entry, and a general bibliography of major texts on war is included in the final volume. Numerous cross-references, 60 maps, and a chronology make this attractive and informative encyclopedia highly accessible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e1e5c335b71c92cb0f2dd9ef898289f33d91bb","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Wars+%28+3+Volume+of+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e1e5c335b71c92cb0f2dd9ef898289f33d91bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,225,229,195,53,183,28,146,203,15,45,217,239,137,130,137,243,61,145,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
