There are songs here that are monolithic examples of the power and glory of '70s AOR like Heart's &quot;Barracuda,&quot; Rick Derringer's &quot;Rock and Roll, Hootchie Koo,&quot; Electric Light Orchestra's &quot;Do Ya,&quot; and Blue ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œyster Cult's &quot;(Don't Fear) The Reaper.&quot; There are Southern rockers (the Charlie Daniels Band, Molly Hatchet), pop/rockers (Eddie Money, Toto), corporate rockers (Boston, Kansas), and even both Winter brothers (Edgar's &quot;Free Ride&quot; is a highlight). Everyone from Ted Nugent to Mountain to Native American rockers Redbone gets a look in. Some of the surprises to be found are Andy Pratt's melodramatic &quot;Avenging Annie,&quot; Iggy &amp; the Stooges' awesome &quot;Raw Power,&quot; and Mother's Finest's foundation-shaking funk-rock fusion jam &quot;Baby Love.&quot; As with any compilation of this nature, you wonder about the bands and songs that were left off. In this case, Journey and REO Speedwagon leap to mind, as each produced some fine rock for the Sony family in the '70s. Despite these omissions, Rockin' 70's is still a good comp that provides a sense of the variety and quality of rock music in the '70s.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetails CD's\nLabel:\t\t\tSony\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Barracuda - Heart\n02.Free Ride - The Edgar Winter Group\n03.Carry On Wayward Son - Kansas\n04.All The Way To Memphis - Mott The Hoople\n05.Rock And Roll, Hootchie Hoo - Rick Derringer\n06.Whiskey Man - Molly Hatchet\n07.Jumpin' Jack Flash - Johnny Winter\n08.The South's Gonna Do It Again - The Charlie Daniels Band\n09.Baby Hold On - Eddie Money\n10.Get It On - Chase\n11.She's Not There - Santana\n12.You Better Think Twice - Poco\n13.Street Corner Serenade - Wet Willie\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Ain't That A Shame (Live) - Cheap Trick\n02.Do Ya - Electric Light Orchestra\n03.Going Down - Jeff Beck Group\n04.Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot) (With The Jeff Beck Group) - Donovan\n05.Are You Ready - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric\n06.Long Cool Woman (In A Black Dress) - The Hollies\n07.Hold Your Head Up - Argent\n08.Once Bitten, Twice Shy - Ian Hunter\n09.Raw Power- Iggy &amp; The Stooges\n10.Baby Love - Mother's Finest\n11.The Witch Queen Of New Orleans - Redbone\n12.Mississippi Queen - Mountain\n13.You Got Livin' - Frank Marino &amp; Mahagony Rush\n\n\nDisc Three\n\n01.Cat Scratch Fever - Ted Nugent\n02.Black Betty - Ram Jam\n03.More Than A Feeling - Boston\n04.(Don't Fear) The Reaper - Blue Oyster Cult\n05.Diamonds And Rust - Judas Priest\n06.Hold The Line - Toto\n07.Freeway Jam (Live) - Jeff Beck\n08.Them Changes (Live) - Carlos Santana &amp; Buddy Miles\n09.Mr. Skin - Spirit\n10.I Don't Need No Doctor - New Riders Of The Purple Sage\n11.Hallelujah - Sweathog\n12.Avenging Annie - Andy Pratt\n13.Thunder And Lightning - Chi Coltrane\n14.Time Bomb - Lake\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6274f0785b47cc3878b4d1744a65cf2790087e41","amp;dn":"VA+-+Rockin%5C%27+70%5C%27s+Box+Set++%282004%29+%5BCDRip%5D+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6274f0785b47cc3878b4d1744a65cf2790087e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,116,240,120,91,71,204,56,120,180,209,116,74,101,207,39,144,8,126,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
