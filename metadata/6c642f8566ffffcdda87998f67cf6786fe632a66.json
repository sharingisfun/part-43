A. Pennebaker that documents the Monterey Pop Festival of 1967. Among Pennebaker's several camera operators were fellow documentarians Richard Leacock and Albert Maysles. The painter Brice Marden has an &quot;assistant camera&quot; credit, and Bob Neuwirth, who figured prominently in Pennebaker's Bob Dylan documentary Dont Look Back, acted as stage manager.

Featured performers include Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane, Hugh Masekela, Otis Redding, Ravi Shankar, The Mamas &amp; the Papas, The Who and the Jimi Hendrix Experience, whose name-sake set his guitar on fire, broke it on the stage, then threw the neck of his guitar in the crowd at the end of &quot;Wild Thing&quot;.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n    \n Performers and songs\n\nSongs featured in the film, in order of appearance:\n\n   1.
