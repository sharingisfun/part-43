It explains in a lot of ways why\nit is such a mess in this world.\n\nIt explains in a very simple and easy to understand way:\n\n* How money is created and where it really comes from.\n* How our moneysystem works.\n* How banks can loan such insane amounts of money.\n* Why everyone is so heavily in debt.\n* Why our money is worth less and less.\n* Why asking interrest over a loan is not a good idea.\n* Why the stuff we buy gets crappier and needs to be replaced sooner.\n* That modern banking is the biggest scam ever.\n* How totally screwed we really are.\n\nBurn the iso to an empty DVD and watch it with your dvd-player. Speech is in English and Dutch subs are provided. Those need to be enabled with the remote. Also note the the first 10-20 seconds will show a black screen. This doesn't mean that the DVD does not work.\n\nI urge everyone to hand this documentary to friends and family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af89b647e9e90efa97354ef37871f82eda55b97a","amp;dn":"Money+as+Debt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af89b647e9e90efa97354ef37871f82eda55b97a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,137,182,71,233,233,14,250,151,53,78,243,120,113,248,46,218,85,185,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
