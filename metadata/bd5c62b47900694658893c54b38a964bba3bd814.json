Official Bluraydate will be 29.4.2011! Now here it is :)\na lot of work around 10 hours. writing down subs from dvdscr and inserting into bluray along with adjusting timeframe. Syncing audio to the bluray which took long because of an audioglitch in the screener which forced me to remove 10sec of footage where i had no fitting audio. But you propably wont notice it because its right at the beginning, but to be fair i mentioned it. Hope you enjoy this early prerelease.\nlast but not least thx to Unevano who made it possible to get me the bluray faster Oh n to that numpty sindakit with all his diff names that says we rename BRrips this HQ is for you lolololol\n\ncredit Hive-CM8 &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru, greenbud1969 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/4791/ffaafafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/4791/ffaafafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/476/fffaafafafaafafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/476/fffaafafafaafafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/9398/fafaq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/9398/fafaq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/2359/ffaafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/2359/ffaafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img227.imageshack.us/img227/8900/ffaafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img227.imageshack.us/img227/8900/ffaafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/5088/fffaaafafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/5088/fffaaafafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/7638/fffaafaafafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img684.imageshack.us/img684/7638/fffaafaafafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6008/fffaafafaafafafa.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6008/fffaafafaafafafa.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977855/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977855/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5c62b47900694658893c54b38a964bba3bd814","amp;dn":"Fair.Game.2010.BDRip.XVID.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8%28READ+NOTES%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5c62b47900694658893c54b38a964bba3bd814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,92,98,180,121,0,105,70,88,137,60,84,179,138,150,75,186,59,216,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
