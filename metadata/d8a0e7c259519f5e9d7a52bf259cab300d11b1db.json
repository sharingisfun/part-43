Their expert : Steven Riley.\n\nThe challenge : douse the flames in a burning building on the opposite side of a lake from 50 feet away, which they must first traverse in their scrap-made firefighting ship.\n\nThe winner of the Grand Final goes on to compete against the season 2 Grand Final winners (The Megalomaniacs) in a series 3 Grand Finale drag race.\n\n(Although in sync, the video doesn't run 'true' for unknown reasons, apologies). V6/A10\n\nHelp me seed (to a ratio of at least 2.0) &amp; get these 'out there' - I have a max. upload speed of c. 80k/s.\n\nThe more help I get the quicker everyone gets them.\n\nIt's a team effort. Please do your part.\n\nUntil I see enough seeding of previous episodes, I won't be allowing anyone to get 100% of the rest of this season, nor uploading seasons 4 - 10. No apologies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8a0e7c259519f5e9d7a52bf259cab300d11b1db","amp;dn":"Scrapheap+Challenge+-+03x09+-+Fireboat+%28Grand+Final%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8a0e7c259519f5e9d7a52bf259cab300d11b1db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,160,231,194,89,81,159,94,157,122,82,191,37,156,171,48,13,17,177,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
