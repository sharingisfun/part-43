The title is a parody of the long-running football-themed comic strip, Roy of the Rovers.\n\nThe show loosely parodied the increasing commercialisation of British football and the then-notorious violent loyalty of the fans. \n\nThe script also made frequent use of Ricky Lenin's attempts to fit in with what he saw as a 'western' lifestyle, in a similar way to some of Sayle's appearances as the Balowski Family in The Young Ones. \n\n\nCast:\nAlexei Sayle as Ricky Lenin \nKenneth Wolstenholme as Frank Lee Brian \nAndrew McClean as Stevie Stalin \nJerold Wells as Brian Frankly \nMaurice Colbourne as Ray of the Rovers \nBallard Berkeley as the colonel [ Series 1 ] \nDonald Hewlett as the colonel [ Series 2 ] \nKeith Allen as Terry Trotsky [ Series 1 ] \nPhil Cornwell as Terry Trotsky [ Series 2 ]  \nJohn Witty as Announcer [ Series 2 ] \n\n\nWritten by Marcus Berkmann \nProduced by Harry Thompson \n\n\nLenin Of The Rovers - S01 - E01 - Up For The Coup\nLenin Of The Rovers - S01 - E02 - Felcherama\nLenin Of The Rovers - S01 - E03 - The Fifth Man\nLenin Of The Rovers - S01 - E04 - Max Gut\n\nLenin Of The Rovers - S02 - E01 - Ghosts And Ghoolies\nLenin Of The Rovers - S02 - E02 - The Felchester Firm\nLenin Of The Rovers - S02 - E03 - Apocalypse Des\nLenin Of The Rovers - S02 - E04 - The Final Solution \n\n\n. \n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 27mn \nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47ba98132fd7cb70e9ae26c137b90f90a645701","amp;dn":"Lenin+Of+The+Rovers+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47ba98132fd7cb70e9ae26c137b90f90a645701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,123,169,129,50,253,124,183,14,154,226,108,19,123,144,249,10,100,87,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
