Unsurprisingly, it is heavy on remixes of songs that were popular in non-remixed form, including Katy Perry's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCalifornia Girls (Armand Van Helden Remix),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ UsherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOMG (Almighty Mix),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Black Eyed Peas' ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œImma Be (Wolfgang Gartner Mix),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Lady Gaga's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBad Romance (Skrillex Remix).ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In fact, CascadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvacuate the DancefloorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the only track to appear in its original form. Regardless, this is a decent overview of mainstream club music that, like the parent series, documents a specific point in time. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tVariable Bit Rate - V 2 198kbps (Standard)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tClub/Dance\nLabel:\t\t\tCapitol/EMI\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Katy Perry - California Gurls (Feat.
