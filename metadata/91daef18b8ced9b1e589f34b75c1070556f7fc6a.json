The land is located in a town called &quot;Raven's Hollow&quot;, and while Michael, or Paris as he prefers to be called, thinks he's just going to pick up the check for the land, he finds that the land is actually the town graveyard, called &quot;The Boneyard&quot;. It's also not empty of occupants, as a number of creatures inhabit it.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91daef18b8ced9b1e589f34b75c1070556f7fc6a","amp;dn":"Boneyard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91daef18b8ced9b1e589f34b75c1070556f7fc6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,218,239,24,184,206,217,177,229,137,243,75,117,193,7,5,86,247,252,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
