He played drums and bongos, and was replaced by Maureen (Mo) Tucker. When this album actually was recorded, I don't know. The cd was released in 1999. This album is all instrumental, psychedelic, and pretty cool. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ef8b6f8934c54b5e5093d9f338c60c52c342e4","amp;dn":"Angus+MacLise+-+The+Invasion+Of+Thunderhead+Pagoda+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ef8b6f8934c54b5e5093d9f338c60c52c342e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,239,139,111,137,52,197,75,94,80,147,217,243,56,198,12,82,195,66,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
