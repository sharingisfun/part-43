The victor of the battle would be wed to Osiris and welcomed into the Egyptian Pantheon as its Queen Goddess.  Isis defeated her sister in battle, but Nephtys was so angry that she and her brother Set, the advisor to the throne, devised an evil spell that cast Isis 5,000 years into the future and erased her from everyone's thoughts and minds. It was as if she never existed.\n\nIsis arrived in modern day Los Angeles, California where with the help of local policeman Scott Dean she creates a new identity for herself.  Her arrival awakes the spirit of her evil brother, Set, who is now an evil demi-god. Set has come back to finish the job he began 5,000 years ago, and destroy Isis so that he may complete his agreement with the Goddess Nephtys and be granted the full power of the God of Chaos and rule the world ... and only Isis can stop him.\n\nLegend of Isis Is was originally published by Image Comics in February 2002 in a one-shot issue. In 2005 Isis received her own ongoing, monthly series, The Legend of Isis at Alias Enterprises by creator Darren G. Davis and writer Ryan Scott Ottney, before moving to her creator Darren G. Davis' publication of Bluewater Productions.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b177f42553293ca291faccc770ae57b59e87fc0","amp;dn":"Legend+of+Isis+%28Bluewater+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b177f42553293ca291faccc770ae57b59e87fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,23,127,66,85,50,147,202,41,31,172,204,119,10,229,123,89,232,127,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
