Heads are rolling at Protected Insurance. He has to dodge shifty clients, crooked lawyers, backstabbing co-workers and the Russian mob as he fights to keep his job.\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. The series airs on Showcase Canada.\n\n\nSeries Info: Described as a cross between The Office and The Sopranos by the show's creator, Malcolm MacRury (ZOS: Zone of Separation, Deadwood), Cra$h &amp; Burn follows Jimmy Burn, a young claims adjuster for a cut-throat, bottom-line insurance corporation. Jimmy maneuvers his way around insurance scams and the criminal underworld as he tries to escape his past and make a better life on the gritty post-industrial streets of Hamilton.\n\nCra$h &amp; Burn stars Luke Kirby (Tell Me You Love Me, Slings and Arrows) as Jimmy Burn, the cocky yet charming up-and-comer looking to claim a piece of the corporate pie as an insurance adjuster. Casting also features Leela Savasta (Battlestar Galactica, Intelligence) as Lucia Silva, Jimmy's live-in girlfriend; Caroline Cave (The L Word, This Beautiful City) as Catherine Scott, a shrewd yet practical in-house insurance lawyer; Clark Johnson (The Wire, Homicide: Life on the Street, also an Emmy-nominated director on The Shield) as Walker Hearn, a veteran insurance investigator and Steve Bacic (The Guard, Andromeda) as Korkov, a conman and Mafioso hustling to scam the system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb12c8721fb11050cb5ead6a3ab9e7e92507830","amp;dn":"Crash.%26.Burn.S01E01.God.Protect.Us.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb12c8721fb11050cb5ead6a3ab9e7e92507830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,177,44,135,33,251,17,5,12,181,234,214,163,171,158,126,146,80,120,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
