Even the most jaded veteran fan had to acknowledge that this show was special by the time it was over.\n\nFor starters, how about a first set so jam-packed it won't fit on one CD?  The &quot;Hot'Lanta&quot; opener and &quot;Gilded Splinters&quot; to follow showed that the band meant business, crisp and tight and hittin' the note right out of the gate!  This version of &quot;Rockin' Horse&quot; was nothing less than amazing, featuring some of both Warren and Derek's finest work.  This song has grown into a jam masterpiece, and is a routine highlight every time it appears.  &quot;Wasted Words&quot; got its' Palace debut here, and showed the band still bringing out new songs late in the run.  Gregg is roaring the blues on this one! The combo of &quot;Soulshine&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl&quot; gave Warren a chance to really shine on vocals.\n\nSpeaking of Warren, a tune he co-wrote with Dickey Betts called &quot;Kind of Bird&quot; was one of the highlights of this show.  Jazzy, swinging and rocking all at the same time, Danny Louis of Gov't Mule added a lot on keyboards, and Oteil is a madman on the bass!  The new, extended jam arrangement of &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; closed out the first set, and opened Disc Two of this marathon show, with Derek soaring to the stars during an expanded slide solo.\n\nThe second set kicked off with a bang, with Doyle Bramhall sitting in on a version of &quot;Meet Me In The Bottom&quot; that is full of great guitar licks and funky grooves.  This &quot;Dreams&quot; is nothing less than spectacular, with one of Derek's finest solos.  If the first set was Warren-heavy, Derek really took the reins in the second set!  The Derek and the Dominoes classic &quot;Anyday&quot; was another spectacular jam, and &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; with Junior Mack on guitar was a master class in the blues, and showed Gregg's voice at its very best.\n\nAn explosive &quot;Jessica&quot; featured Kris Jensen on sax, giving the song a different flair, and Doyle Bramhall came back for a combustible &quot;One Way Out&quot; encore.  Another great night of Peakin' at the Palace!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1639a703d1f159e500fd887eb5cd5ec17a02ba","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+-+LIVE+03%2F19%2F2010+%5B320k+MP3%5D+NYC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb1639a703d1f159e500fd887eb5cd5ec17a02ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,22,57,167,3,209,241,89,229,0,253,136,126,181,205,94,193,122,2,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
