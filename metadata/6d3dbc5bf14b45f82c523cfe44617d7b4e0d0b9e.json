April 7, 1975) was an American writer of hardboiled crime fiction. He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n--Wikipedia\n\n  In Charles Williams' Gulf Coast Girl, Shannon Macauley--a tall, blonde ex-showgirl--hires Bill Manning--a diver, sailor, and writer--to help her husband escape from gangsters. The husband had stolen a cache of diamonds from the gangsters, but lost them in a plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico. He survived, but the diamonds sank with the plane. Despite Bill's efforts, which include killing one of the thugs, the escape plan fails. The gangsters kill the husband, framing Shannon for his murder. They then force Shannon to give them directions to the site of the plane crash and force Bill to sail a boat to the site and try to salvage the diamonds. Bill and Shannon fall in love during the voyage. But their future is bleak because even if they escape, they will still be hunted--hunted by the gang who still want the diamonds and hunted by the police for two murders. The ending is clever and surprising--and I, for one, didn't see it coming, even though Williams dropped hints along the way.\n--pigeye\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3dbc5bf14b45f82c523cfe44617d7b4e0d0b9e","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+Gulf+Coast+Girl+%28aka+Scorpion+Reef%29+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3dbc5bf14b45f82c523cfe44617d7b4e0d0b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,61,188,91,241,75,69,248,44,82,60,254,68,97,125,123,78,13,11,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
