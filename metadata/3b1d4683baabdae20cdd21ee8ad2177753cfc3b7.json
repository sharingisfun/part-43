The film\ndepicts a future world in 2035 devastated by disease, forcing the human\npopulation to live underground. Convict James Cole (Willis) &quot;volunteers&quot; for\ntime travel duty to gather information in exchange for prison release. When\nhe first arrives in the past, Cole is arrested and locked up in a psychiatric\nhospital, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe), a psychiatrist, and\nJeffrey Goines (Pitt), the insane son of a scientist and virus expert.\n\nAfter Universal Pictures acquired the rights to remake La JetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e as a fulllength\nfilm, David and Janet Peoples were hired to write the script. Under\nTerry Gilliam's direction, Universal granted the filmmakers a $29.5 million\nbudget, and filming for 12 Monkeys lasted from February to May 1995. The\nfilm was shot mostly in Philadelphia and Baltimore, the setting of the story.\n\nThe film was released to critical praise and grossed approximately $168\nmillion in worldwide box office totals. Brad Pitt was nominated the Academy\nAward for Best Supporting Actor, and won a Golden Globe for his\nperformance. 12 Monkeys also won and was nominated for various\ncategories at the Saturn Awards.\n\n\nPlot\n\n\nJames Cole (Willis) is a convicted criminal living in a grim post-apocalyptic\nfuture. In 1996-1997, the Earth's surface was contaminated by a virus so\ndeadly that it forced the surviving population to live underground. To earn a\npardon, Cole allows scientists to send him on dangerous missions to the\npast to collect information on the virus, thought to be released by a terrorist\norganization known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. If possible, he is to\nobtain a pure sample of the original virus so a cure can be made.\nThroughout the film, Cole is troubled with recurring dreams involving a chase\nand a shooting in an airport.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/17177742862137&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/17177742862137&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n* Bruce Willis as James Cole\n* Madeleine Stowe as Kathryn Railly\n* Brad Pitt as Jeffrey Goines\n* Christopher Plummer as Dr. Goines\n* Jon Seda as Jose\n* Christopher Meloni as Lt.
