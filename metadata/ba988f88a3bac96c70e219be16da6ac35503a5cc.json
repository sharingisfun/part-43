An attempted assassination by a mob boss goes badly and Frankie retaliates, only to wind up in the hands of the Feds. Frankie agrees to testify against the mobsters and his life is suddenly worthless - unless he submits to going into federal protection. The FBI gives him a new name - Howard Akers - and relocates him to a sleepy middle-class suburb in Little Rock, AR. Howard catches the attention of his lovely neighbor, Leigh, a bored fund-raiser for a non-profit zoo whose husband, Dennis, is having an affair - and she knows it, but she doesn't know it's with her hot-blooded sister, Bootsie. Leigh becomes friends with the enigmatic Howard, but Dennis and Bootsie see an opportunity to earn the million-dollar bounty the mob has put on his head by turning him in to the mob.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba988f88a3bac96c70e219be16da6ac35503a5cc","amp;dn":"Federal+Protection+%282002%29.DVDRip.GoGo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba988f88a3bac96c70e219be16da6ac35503a5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,152,143,136,163,186,201,108,112,226,25,190,22,218,106,195,85,3,165,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
