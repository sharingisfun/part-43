Several modes of speech are used; which include, along with colloquial and heightened prose, a formal verse for the elegies of the Cumaean Sibyl and a more relaxed pentameter for the young lovers, Attilio and Francesca. The lovers are  given a full-dress sonnet each as a\nsoliloquy at their moment of most intense feeling. These langourous wanderings through the ruins are interrupted by flashbacks to an erupting Vesuvius, bringing to dust the plans and aspirations of the innocent and guilty alike.\n\nLike The Lizard in this play, basking in the glowing sun, you should relish this perfect incarnation of radio drama. Its an echo of a golden past.\n\nReed wrote nearly 40 plays for radio, most were broadcast in the 1950s and 1960's on the Third Programme, including the wonderful Hilda Tablet plays. Some of these were re-broadcast in the 1970s, so its possible that someone has recordings \nof them, please consider uploading and sharing if you have any.\n\n\n\nThe Cast:\n\nThe Cumaen Sibyl....Flora Robson\nThe Traveller.......Marius Goring\nAttilio.............Carlo Cura\nFrancesca...........Rosalind Shanks\nThe Lizard..........Carlton Hobbs\nMacFarlane..........John Laurie\nMacBride............Frank Duncan\nJudy................Hilda Kreiseman\nWalter..............David Spencer\nBill................Derek Seaton\nMargery.............Deborah Dallas\nThe Guide...........Hector Ross\nThe Merchant........Godfrey Kenton\nhis Wife............Kathleen Helm\nAn Old Man..........Malcolm Hayes\nThe Silent Old Gentleman..Carlton Hobbs\nThe Silent Old Lady.......Kathleen Helm\n\nMusic by Anthony Smith-Masters\n\nProducer Douglas Cleverdon.\n\n\nsource: tape recording of broadcast material\n\n\nType                : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate             : 128\nMode                : stereo\nFrequency           : 44100 Hz\nFrames              : 223035\nLength              : 01:37:06\nEncoder             : Gogo (before 3.0)\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306596dc93b10b1c2fcd98f95b6474f1efe19df6","amp;dn":"The+Streets+of+Pompeii++%28BBC+Radio+1970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306596dc93b10b1c2fcd98f95b6474f1efe19df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,101,150,220,147,177,11,28,47,205,152,249,91,100,116,241,239,225,157,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
