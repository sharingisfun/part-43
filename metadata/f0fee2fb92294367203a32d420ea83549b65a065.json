In this course, photographer Frank Doorhof shows viewers some techniques for freezing a subject in motion. He travels to an outdoor skate park to shoot a BMX bicycle rider and then goes into the studio to photograph a leaping model. During the shoots, Doorhof talks about how he adjusts his lighting setups and camera settings. He also discusses the importance of changing perspective, how to use strobes and flashes to achieve high contrast effects, a white balance trick for colorizing your images, and how to use scrims and flags to eliminate lens flare. Photographing moving subjects can yield some exciting and dynamic images so follow along with this Kelby Training course and learn how it is done.\n\nLesson 01 Introduction (4:27)\nLesson 02 BMX Ramp, Part 1 (7:31)\nLesson 03 BMX Ramp, Part 2 (10:05)\nLesson 04 BMX Jumps with Rain (5:14)\nLesson 05 Jump Shots (8:41)\nLesson 06 Eliminating Lens Flare (8:53)\nLesson 07 Lighting Changes (7:09)\nLesson 08 Styling (5:28)\n\nTOTAL: 00:57:28\n\n[IMG]http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/69/kelbytrainig1.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/8145/kelbytrainig2.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/764/kelbytrainig3.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/8371/kelbytrainig4.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img207.imageshack.us/img207/7919/kelbytrainig5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img573.imageshack.us/img573/6131/kelbytrainig6.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fee2fb92294367203a32d420ea83549b65a065","amp;dn":"Freeze+Motion+Photography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fee2fb92294367203a32d420ea83549b65a065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,254,226,251,146,41,67,103,32,58,50,212,32,234,131,84,155,101,160,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
