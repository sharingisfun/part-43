Just when you thought it was safe to park again in Philly: Parking Wars returns, more riotous than ever!\n\nThe people you love to hate - the men and women of the Philadelphia Parking Authority - are back, ticketing, booting and towing the cars of problem parkers who express their outrage in furious Philly fashion.\n\nReturning faves include &quot;Gadget Man&quot; Garfield and his booting partner Sherry, hunting for scofflaws in a new high-tech van. And ticket writers are back to face off with irate citizens and dodge angry drivers including wise***ing Brian, short-but-tough Carmen, the trouble-attracting Danielle, male-attention-magnet Marylin, the protective supervisor Luz and fun-loving Shawn. New faces include rookie ticket writer Mike who clashes with drunken revelers on wild South Street, &quot;glamour gal&quot; Marlene, tough-talking Lori, and Jen who is so gung-ho to boot, she'll even scan for scofflaws on her own block.\n\nAll roads in Philly still lead to the impound lot - the &quot;car prison&quot; where tempers flare as drivers struggle to get their cars back. This season a man becomes so outraged that no one can calm him down, a religious couple looks to the power of Jesus to help them, police are called in to investigate an alleged theft, and a teenager blames everyone but herself for being towed.\n\nOur &quot;heroes&quot; not only endure verbal abuse but they can also experience real danger. When a police officer is shot and killed, the unarmed parking officers are reminded how scary it can be to wear a uniform and walk a gritty beat.\n\nIntense, humorous and always emotional - &quot;Parking Wars&quot;' second season is more outrageous than ever.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c4eccc08eb894dc1fc0d947dc8387c702fd85a","amp;dn":"parking.wars.s03e01.VeroVenlo.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c4eccc08eb894dc1fc0d947dc8387c702fd85a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,196,236,204,8,235,137,77,193,252,13,148,125,200,56,124,112,47,216,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
