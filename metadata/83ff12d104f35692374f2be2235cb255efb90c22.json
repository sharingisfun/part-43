Included with the disc is a 28-page booklet containing song titles/credits, Metallica band pictures old &amp; new, album covers and/or band photos of artists being covered, and 20-pages of written bio by David Fricke (Managing Editor, Rolling Stone Magazine). Disc-1 recorded Sept/Oct 1998 at The Plant Studios, Sausalito, CA. Disc-2 recorded at numerous locations from 1984-95. This is their 8th album. Label - Elektra. \n\nCOMMENTS: All cover tunes. Brilliant idea. Metallica pays homage to the bands they grew up with and admired. Many of the songs they cover here are hard to find - and you may not find them anywhere else but here. A few of my all-time favorite Metallica tracks are here... &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Killing Time&quot;. New classics from disc-1 include &quot;Sabbra Cadabra&quot; (Black Sabbath), &quot;Astronomy&quot; (Blue Oyster Cult), &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; (Lynyrd Skynyrd), and &quot;It's Electric&quot; (Diamond Head). Two great covers of &quot;Turn The Page&quot; (Bob Seger) and &quot;Whiskey In The Jar&quot; (Thin Lizzy) were also excellent, but sadly destroyed by being over played on the radio. Other artists being covered on &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; include those listed above as well as Danzig, Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, Killing Joke, Motorhead (4 songs featured), Queen, Budgie (2 songs), Mercyful Fate (the track &quot;Mercyful Fate&quot; is a medley of their songs - &quot;Satan's Fall&quot;, &quot;Curse of the Pharaohs&quot;, &quot;A Corpse Without Soul&quot;, &quot;Into The Coven&quot;, &quot;Evil&quot;... at over 11 minutes, it's Metallica's longest song ever recorded), etc. &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; enjoyed success on the charts - reached #2 on the Billboard Top 200 Album charts for 1998; singles &quot;Turn the Page&quot; (#1 on the Mainstream Rock charts), &quot;Whiskey In The Jar&quot; (#4 - also won a Grammy Award for best hard rock performance), and &quot;Die, Die My Darling&quot; (#26). This release - Great idea. Lots of music. Great songs (some more classic than others) played by one of the best metal bands of the '80's/90's. Something for old/new fans alike with plenty of thrash and mainstream heavy metal. Great sound production. Awesome set of discs (5 stars). \n\nby R.
