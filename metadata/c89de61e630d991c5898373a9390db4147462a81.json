Equip your ship, form alliances, and trade your wares in this futuristic world. You travel in your personal sub through 60 different missions. Along the way, a sinister plot comes up, and you must be the person to bring it to a halt.\n\n2) AQ - The water is no longer calm. The undersea world has undergone a transformation from tranquil environment to a place of unspeakable violence, graphic murder and horrific danger. It is now the 27th century and mercenaries such as 'Emerald' Dead Eye Flint ply their deadly trade among the warring forces of man and nature. Gamers take the role of Flint, taking command of a loosely aligned force of fellow mercenaries who hire themselves out to the powerful leaders of this inhospitable world. Players fight vicious battles against crazed mercenaries, mighty military forces and hideous sea monsters. The frantic pace never lets up in Aquanox, true adrenaline-rush action for today's gamers.\n\n3) AQ 2 - A new story of the underwater world Aqua.
