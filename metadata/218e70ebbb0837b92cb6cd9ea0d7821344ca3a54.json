Analytic thermodynamic models are developed for a wide variety of cooling systems and a broad range of operating conditions. These models are easily implemented in the field or laboratory. Although the authors focus upon mechanical (electrically-driven) chillers - primarily reciprocating and centrifugal machines - there is also substantial material on heat-driven absorption chillers. Heat pumps and heat transformers are also addressed. A few less common chiller types are also treated, such as thermoelectric, thermoacoustic and vortex-tube units. \n\nThe material is presented in a manner that can appeal to both the engineer and the physicist, and can form a bridge between the two communities in their analysis and presentation of cooling systems. In each chapter, the authors try to capture the basic physics of the problem, and to emerge with quantitatively accurate predictive and diagnostic tools. They aim for simple thermodynamic models where the functional dependencies of chiller performance on the major operating variables are transparent. And all the models presented are required to stand the test of comparison against experimental performance data. The reader is shown how chillers can be viewed as input-output devices, viewed from the outside and probed with only externally-measurable parameters such as power input, cooling rate and coolant temperatures. measurable parameters such as power input, cooling rate and coolant temperatures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218e70ebbb0837b92cb6cd9ea0d7821344ca3a54","amp;dn":"Cool+Thermodynamics+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218e70ebbb0837b92cb6cd9ea0d7821344ca3a54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,142,112,235,187,8,55,185,44,182,205,158,160,215,130,19,68,202,58,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
