Jackson is at first unaware he's on \nfire, and continues dancing. \n\nHe was never the same after the accident, reports the new issue of Us Weekly, on \nstands today.\n\nTo relieve the second and third-degree burns on his scalp and body (and later to \nhelp him tolerate multiple surgeries on the scorched spot on his head), Jackson \nwas prescribed several medications, which kicked off his addiction to painkillers \nand obsession with plastic surgery, multiple sources tell Us.\n\n\n\nType: Videoclip\nFormat: MPEG (12,8 MB), Xvid-AVI (13,1 MB)\nDuration: 01.26 min (= 01 min + 26 sec)\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.usmagazine.com/news/video-michael-jacksons-tragic-commercial-accident-2009157&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.usmagazine.com/news/video-michael-jacksons-tragic-commercial-accident-2009157&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\nInfo Wikipedia:\n\n\n\nIn 1984, Pepsi sponsored The Jacksons' Victory Tour. In return, Michael and his \nbrothers were to star in two commercials for the company. Jackson had reworked \n&quot;Billie Jean&quot; for the commercial and entitled it &quot;Pepsi Generation&quot;. \n\nThe song was used as the official jingle for the commercials and released as a \n7&quot; promo single. The launch of &quot;The Choice of a New Generation&quot; campaign in \nFebruary 1984 was attended by 1,600 people who were issued with a programme and \na 7&quot; single. During the filming of the second commercial a firework exploded and \nJackson's hair caught fire, leaving the singer needing reconstructive surgery.\n\nThe commercials were premiered at the Grammy Awards, with Jackson wearing a \nhairpiece to cover his burns as he collected a record eight awards.\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean#Pepsi_commercials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean#Pepsi_commercials&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?f=34&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=30402&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at july 16, 2009 - 11.10 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da6b2d2916e6653563806dfa29feee270ad3fa4","amp;dn":"Michael+Jackson%5C%27s+%5C%27Pepsi+Commercial+Hair+Accident%5C%27+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da6b2d2916e6653563806dfa29feee270ad3fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,166,178,210,145,110,102,83,86,56,6,223,162,159,238,226,112,173,63,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
