Mantronix were probably the first group to popularise samples as pop hooks, although their music actually crossed the boundaries of hardcore rap, electro, techno and house, their music has inspired artists around the world. Their first single; Fresh Is The Word, hit the streets of New York in 1985 courtesy of Sleeping Bag Records. The track had the streets and clubs of New York pumping with its raw beats and East Coast rapping that draws comparisons to Run DMC and LL Cool J. Their second single, Ladies, featured a smoother vocal sound than Fresh Is The Word, and the third single followed just a few months later, Bassline, is another slice of typical mid-80's hip-hop with it's raw beats and energetic rapping, and reached the UK top 40 in May 1986. With its futuristic production Mantronix: The Album was way ahead of it's time when released in 1985 and featured all of their hit singles and some of the rawest hip hop ever released. Now the album has been remastered and features 5 extra tracks - different versions of three of their key tracks. This album is Mantronix best and an essential album for any hip hop fan.\n\n\nTracks\n\t1.\tBassline \n\t2.\tNeedle to the Groove \n\t3.\tMega-Mix \n\t4.\tHardcore Hip-Hop \n\t5.\tLadies \n\t6.\tGet Stupid &quot;Fresh&quot;, Pt. 1 \n\t7.\tFresh Is the Word \n        8.
