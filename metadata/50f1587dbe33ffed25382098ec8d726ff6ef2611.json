His best-known compositions include &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;, &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; and &quot;Johnny Strikes Up The Band&quot;, all of which are featured on his 1978 release, Excitable Boy. Other well-known songs written by Zevon have been recorded by other artists, including &quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot;, &quot;Mohammed's Radio&quot;, &quot;Carmelita&quot;, and &quot;Hasten Down the WInd&quot;.\n\nAlong with his own compositions Zevon recorded or performed occasional covers, including Bob Dylan's &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; and Leonard Cohen's &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;. He was a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman later performed guest vocals on &quot;Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)&quot; with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.\n\nDuring the Sentimental Hygiene sessions, Zevon also participated in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers by the likes of Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and Prince. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they would eventually see the light of day as a Hindu Love Gods album.\n\nThe immediate follow-up to Sentimental Hygiene was 1989's Transverse City, a futuristic concept album inspired by Zevon's interest in the work of cyberpunk science fiction author William Gibson. It featured guests including Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady, keyboard player Chick Corea and guitarists Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour and Neil Young. Key tracks include the title song, &quot;Splendid Isolation,&quot; &quot;Run Straight Down&quot; (which had a promotional video that featured Zevon singing in a factory while Gilmour played his guitar solos) and &quot;They Moved the Moon,&quot; the latter among Zevon's eerier ballads.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50f1587dbe33ffed25382098ec8d726ff6ef2611","amp;dn":"Warren+Zevon+-+Run+Straight+Down++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50f1587dbe33ffed25382098ec8d726ff6ef2611","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,241,88,125,190,51,255,237,37,56,32,152,236,141,114,111,246,239,38,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
