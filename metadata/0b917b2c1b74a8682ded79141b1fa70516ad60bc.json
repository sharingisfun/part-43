Now, 30 years later, Jacques' son Jean-Michel Cousteau and his expedition team have set sail to explore dangerous and spectacular locales across the globe in the high-definition series, Jean-Michel Cousteau: Ocean Adventures, premiering with the film Voyage to Kure.\n\n\nIn this two-part episode, the Ocean Adventures team explores the Amazon, the most powerful of the world's rivers. Flowing through the world's largest tropical rainforest -- the most biodiverse region on the planet -- the Amazon is endangered, and it has the potential to alter global climate. Twenty-five years ago, Jean-Michel Cousteau explored the Amazon. Since that time, an area almost the size of Texas has been deforested. Cousteau and his team return to gather information on how this has affected the region and the planet and how it may continue to impact our world. \n\nEpisode: Return to the Amazon\nThe Amazon River travels through nine countries and contains more species of fish than the Atlantic Ocean\n\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 47mn 1s 187ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 240 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 368 (1.652) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b917b2c1b74a8682ded79141b1fa70516ad60bc","amp;dn":"PBS+Ocean+Adventures-+Return+to+the+Amazon+1of2.%282008%29.WS-PDTV.X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b917b2c1b74a8682ded79141b1fa70516ad60bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,145,123,44,27,116,168,104,45,237,121,20,27,31,167,5,22,173,96,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
