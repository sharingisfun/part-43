You can also set it to\nnotify you when you have reached a certain amount. This\nis useful if you have a metered connection, and you don't\nwant to go past your limit.\n\nThis older version still works as well as the newer ones,\nbut doesn't require complicated cracks and doesn't phone\nhome. It does not include all the bells and whistles of the\nnewer versions (4.0+).\n\nTracked on a variety of public trackers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:237412abf908be53a05d2f3d03833028f94fdc87","amp;dn":"DU+Meter+3.05+Build+148+%5BWindows%5D+%5BSerial+Included%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"237412abf908be53a05d2f3d03833028f94fdc87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,116,18,171,249,8,190,83,160,93,47,61,3,131,48,40,249,79,220,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
