Finally, there's a guide that delivers. \n\n\nAs a professor at the Spanish university that offered that country's first master's degree in video game creation, author Daniel Sanchez-Crespo recognizes that there's a core programming curriculum every game designer should be well versed in-and he's outlined it in these pages. \n\n\nBy focusing on time-tested coding techniques-and providing code samples that use C++, and the OpenGL and DirectX APIs-Daniel has produced a guide whose shelf life will extend long beyond the latest industry trend. \n\n\nCode design, data structures, design patterns, AI, scripting engines, 3D pipelines, texture mapping, and more: They're all covered here-in clear, coherent fashion and with a focus on the essentials that will have you referring back to this volume for years to come. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb59187679f7c9c6a866733b68a466a4abf5a54f","amp;dn":"Core+Techniques+and+Algorithms+in+Game+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb59187679f7c9c6a866733b68a466a4abf5a54f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,89,24,118,121,247,201,198,168,102,115,59,104,164,102,164,171,245,165,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
