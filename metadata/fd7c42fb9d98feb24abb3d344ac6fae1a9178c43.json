The story is an adaptation of the Silent Hill series of survival horror games created by Konami. The film, particularly its emotional and aesthetic content as well as its creature design, includes elements from Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, and Silent Hill 3. The film also includes some music, such as Wounded Warsong, from the fourth game. A game in the series released after the film, Silent Hill Homecoming, incorporated some elements of the film.\n\nThe film follows a mother, Rose, who takes her troubled adopted daughter, Sharon, to Silent Hill, the town the girl cries out for while sleepwalking. After being knocked unconscious in a car crash outside the town, Rose awakens to find her daughter missing and the town engulfed in an alternate reality of fog and falling ash. While searching for her daughter, she faces surreal reality shifts and monstrous creatures while uncovering her daughter's connections to the town's dark secrets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd7c42fb9d98feb24abb3d344ac6fae1a9178c43","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd7c42fb9d98feb24abb3d344ac6fae1a9178c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,124,66,251,157,152,254,178,74,187,61,52,74,198,250,225,169,23,140,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
