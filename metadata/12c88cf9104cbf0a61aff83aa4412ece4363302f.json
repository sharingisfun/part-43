While she continued to sell records in healthy numbers into the 21st century, she expanded her activities as an actress in film and on the legitimate stage, and particularly on television, where she starred in a long-running situation comedy. Such diversification made her the greatest crossover star to emerge from country music since Dolly Parton. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tCountry\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Does He Love You (Duet With Linda Davis)\n02.You Lie\n03.Fancy\n04.For My Broken Heart\n05.Love Will Find Its Way To You\n06.They Asked About You\n07.Is There Life Out There\n08.Rumor Has It\n09.Walk On\n10.The Greatest Man I Never Knew\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12c88cf9104cbf0a61aff83aa4412ece4363302f","amp;dn":"Reba+McEntire-Greatest++Hits+Vol+2+%281993%29%5BCDRip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12c88cf9104cbf0a61aff83aa4412ece4363302f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,200,140,249,16,76,191,10,97,175,248,58,164,65,46,206,67,99,48,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
