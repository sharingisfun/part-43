Ort) drowns his sorrows in liquor and awakes the next morning in bed with a car thief, Edward (Tim Bergmann), who happens to be gay. With no place to go, Christoph rooms with Edward, who ignores his assertions that he's straight. While everyone at work gossips about Christoph's sexuality, lovely Helen (Carin C. Tietze) romances him.\n\n Ripped with CloneDVD, spoken language is German with English embedded subtitles. My upload speed isnt fantastic, so please help seed a little bit once you get yours.
