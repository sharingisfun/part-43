I changed the file types over to mp3 so they'd be more compatible with most people's music programs and such, and also translated them into 320 kbps. Enjoy.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is the sophomore album from the Seattle-native, William Control. It's a follow up to the 2008 Hate Culture phenomena, and certainly lives up to its predecessors hype. All around good album, with high points, in my opinion, throughout the entire thing. I've played it through about 4 or 5 times now and will most likely be keeping it on repeat for the next few days at the very least.\n\ntl;dr, great fucking album. Any real fan of Wil Francis will love this.\n\n|Track Listing|\n_________________\n\nUne Annonce | 1:25\nVorspiel | 1:06\nAll Due Restraint | 3:09\nI'm Only Human Sometimes | 3:30\nCan't Help Falling In Love | 3:23\nWhy Dance With The Devil When You Have Me | 4:11\nMy Lady Dominate | 4:03\nSoliloquy | 3:57\nDorian Gray | 3:47\nUltrasound | 2:53\nNoir | 2:33\nEpilogue | 11:22\n\n|Stand-Out Tracks|\n_________________\n\nAll Due Restraint\nI'm Only Human Sometimes\nCan't Help Falling In Love (amazing Elvis cover)\nDorian Gray\n\nThese four tracks alone set in stone the type of music William does best. Listen to them for yourself and make your own assumptions, and goddammit buy the CD when it's released on June 8th, it's amazing and deserves all of the sales it can get. If you download this torrent and do not end up buying the album sometime in the near future, I will end you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f75f46dd80b70d61736804c7523a19b770b89c","amp;dn":"William+Control+%7C%7C+Noir+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71f75f46dd80b70d61736804c7523a19b770b89c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,247,95,70,221,128,183,13,97,115,104,4,199,82,58,25,183,112,184,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
