The main world is divided into the &quot;Real World&quot; and the &quot;Dream World&quot;, each with a separate, but similar map. To get from one world to the other, the party uses special warps (such as in wells), by ascending/descending stairs on the world map or falling through holes in the &quot;Dream World&quot; to the &quot;Real World&quot;.\nIf something cannot be found in the &quot;Real World&quot;, it may appear in the &quot;Dream World&quot;, such as with Spiegelspire, in the middle of the quest. Also, another similarity to much of the series is the &quot;Dread Realm&quot;. This separate map features a dark island with a psychedelic sea surrounding it and some of the toughest monsters in the game. The final boss, Mortamor, lives there. Also, once Mortamor is defeated, the player can access the bonus dungeon and the secret final boss, Nokturnus.\n\nJapanese Release on - January 28, 2010       [Released]\nNorth America Release on - February 14, 2011 [Released]\n\nI am still working on confirming that the patched and non-patched versions of these games work on all flash cards, with or without active protection bypass.
