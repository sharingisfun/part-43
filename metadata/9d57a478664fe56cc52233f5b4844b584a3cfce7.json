Aubrey Smith, Katherine DeMille, Joseph Schildkraut\n\nDirected by: Cecil B. DeMille\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Crusades (1935)\n\nThe Holy Wars are given the usual overblown Cecil B. DeMille treatment in The Crusades. \n\nIt all begins in the 12th-century AD, when Jerusalem falls into the hands of the Saracens, and the Christians are slaughtered or sold into slavery. A holy man known as The Hermit (C. Aubrey Smith) rallies the rulers of England and Europe to launch a Crusade to reclaim Jerusalem in the name of Christianity. \n\nAmong those embarking upon this massive undertaking is England's King Richard the Lion-Hearted (played as a swaggering roughneck by Henry Wilcoxon), who finances his knights by marrying wealthy French princess Berengaria (Loretta Young) sight unseen. Saladin (Ian Keith), the elegant and well-spoken ruler of the Saracens, attempts to stave off the crusaders by kidnapping Berengaria and holding her hostage.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d57a478664fe56cc52233f5b4844b584a3cfce7","amp;dn":"The+Crusades+%281935+-+Cecile+B+DeMille%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d57a478664fe56cc52233f5b4844b584a3cfce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,87,164,120,102,79,229,108,197,34,51,245,180,132,75,88,74,60,252,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
