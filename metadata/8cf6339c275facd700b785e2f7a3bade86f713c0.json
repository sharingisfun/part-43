In Rome, Emperor Claudius, newly risen to the imperial throne, dreams of taking his place in history alongside his illustrious forebears Caesar and Augustus. Among the legions marches Rufus, keeper of the Emperor's elephant. War is coming and the united tribes of Britain will make a desperate stand against the might of Rome. The Emperor has a very special place for Rufus and his elephant in the midst of the battle - as a secret weapon to cow the Britons with the visible manifestation of Rome's power. &quot;Claudius&quot; is a masterful telling of one of the greatest stories from Roman history, the conquest of Britain. It is an epic story of ambition, courage, conspiracy, battle and bloodshed, and confirms Douglas Jackson as one of the best historical novelists writing today.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cf6339c275facd700b785e2f7a3bade86f713c0","amp;dn":"Claudius+-+Douglas+Jacks++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cf6339c275facd700b785e2f7a3bade86f713c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,246,51,156,39,95,172,215,0,183,133,226,247,163,186,222,134,247,19,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
