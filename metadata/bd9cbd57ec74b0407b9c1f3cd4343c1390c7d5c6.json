The album was commercially successful, reaching number 12 on the UK Albums Chart and number four on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nOriginally titled Soul Sucka, the album is the first to feature guitarist Gus G and drummer Tommy Clufetos, who replaced long-term guitarist Zakk Wylde and Mike Bordin respectively.
