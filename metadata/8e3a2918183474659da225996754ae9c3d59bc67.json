Make sure VMware W'Stn (v6-7.x) or VM Player (v3.x) is turned off \n   (can't patch a file if it's in use).\n2. Double-click the Installer and make your selection ...it will confirm done, seconds later.\n3. VMware should now run with the bios file you selected.\n\nNote:- on first use a &quot;back-up&quot; copy of your vmware-vmx.exe is made and confirmation of \nit's location displayed ... if for any reason you wish to return to an untouched state, you have \nthe ability to just manually overwrite vmware-vmx.exe in your Program Files with your untouched \nback-up copy.\n\nMain Menu\n\n1-55:\nIndividual manufacturer brands with SLP 2.1 + 1.0 (*=no SLP1.0)\n\nXP:\nVirtual PC Mode for XP\n\nSLP:\nMulti (AIO) manufacturer brands (over 90+) with SLP1's for XP\n\nUSB:\nUSB_Boot.iso file delivered to Desktop to allow booting USB Stick in VMWare\n\nON/OFF:\n10 second boot delay option (on/off)\n\n00:\nreturn VMWare to default state (un-patched)\n\nUSB Boot (USB_Boot.iso allows booting from USB Stick)\n\nThe VMWare virtual machine's BIOS does not offer the option to boot from USB.\n\nThere is a workaround:-\n\n* Download the plpbt-x.x.x.zip file and unzip it.\n* Boot your virtual machine on plpbtnoemul.iso or plpbt.iso\n\n* Choose USB with up/down arrows and press ENTER.\n* Before you press ENTER, remember to &quot;connect&quot; your USB drive to the virtual machine:\n\nNote that: This trick doesn't work under VirtualBox.\n\nSource Files:- Plop [ http://www.plop.at/]\nSource Info:- Kioskea [ http://en.kioskea.net/faq/7591-boot-from-your-usb-drive-under-vmware]\n\nDOWNLOAD LINK 1:- Main Patcher\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datafilehost.com/download-d4269581.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datafilehost.com/download-d4269581.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* updated 28/02/2011\n\n* added various &quot;Brands&quot;\n\n* updated script\n\nFile: VMBIOS_Selector_v315l.7z\nCRC-32: 5008cb83\nMD4: 4a8a795baa2c73a0a8ff04718bd4b931\nMD5: d34ed5c1cced5cd51bb1c671c36d0127\nSHA-1: d141ecb530cf9de3df7df8a554146736304d464c\nSize : 7.21mb\n\nDOWNLOAD LINK 2:- ROM Collection\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.datafilehost.com/download-741de919.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.datafilehost.com/download-741de919.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n* updated 28/02/2011\n\n* added various &quot;Brands&quot; &amp; &quot;BootLogo's&quot;\n\n* collection of individual VMWare Bios Rom files from main patcher (over 50+ brands)\n\nFile: VMWare_ROM_Collection.7z\nCRC-32: a22c013c\nMD4: 48267ed82dc5784af653ddbd3031477b\nMD5: 5923471127f6a74996d280cbee140285\nSHA-1: 5bcf97b9df023e2b379c334bf1491e4cf7ef1f95\nSize : 1.6mb\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e3a2918183474659da225996754ae9c3d59bc67","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation%2FPlayer+%28Multi-Brand%29+Bios+Installer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e3a2918183474659da225996754ae9c3d59bc67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,58,41,24,24,52,116,101,157,162,37,153,103,84,174,156,61,89,188,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
