Before the start of season two of Smallville, DC Comics published a one-shot comic based on the television series simply titled Smallville: The Comic.  The issue featured two stories. The first, written by Mark Verheiden and Roy Martinez and the second  by Michael Green and John Paul Leon.  Eventually, DC Comics began publishing a bi-monthly comic featuring various stories involving the characters from Smallville.  Writer and script co-ordinator Clint Carpenter describes the comic book line as a companion piece to the show, instead of a non-canon version of the characters. As Carpenter describes it, the comic book line expands on events that occur in the show, like showing what happens after season ending cliffhangers.  Carpenter sees the comics as providing &quot;additional depth&quot; to those characters that receive limited screen time on the show, or whose storylines need additional explanation.\n\nCarpenter was not the first person asked to oversee the comic. Mark Verheiden, who co-wrote the one-shot comic, was originally going to be in charge of the bi-monthly series.  Verheiden's commitment to the television series kept him from taking on the comic books, so he asked Carpenter if he would take on the responsibility.  Although the series is meant to expand on the events of the show, occasionally there are continuity errors that are created because of the differences in production schedules between the comic and the show.  The series not only ties into the television show, but also the Chloe Chronicles webisodes, and the various Smallville-related webpages.  In addition, the comics feature interviews with the cast and crew, as well as information on the production of the episodes.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cc0504a40945306e4de78d31b82f3b5428d685","amp;dn":"Smallville+%28TV+Tie-in%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cc0504a40945306e4de78d31b82f3b5428d685","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,204,5,4,164,9,69,48,110,77,231,141,49,184,47,59,84,40,214,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
