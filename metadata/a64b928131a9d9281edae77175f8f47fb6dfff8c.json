If they legalized it, they may be correct. Smoking Pot is a sin? NOT. Drinking Wine a Sin? Nope. It's in The Bible, The Divine Word of God!!!\n\nGENESIS 1:29 \n29  And God said, Behold, [b]I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth[/b], and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. \n\nDid you know that there are 23 different trees listed in the Bible? Did you know that when this text is written in Hebrew, all 23 trees are spelled with ELS in that 1 sentence. Google: equal distance letter sequence. For a better explanation than I care give. (Eg. Write down every 7th letter to make a word.)This happens only in The original Hebrew Torah.(OT)If just one letter in The Scriptures was changed this phenomena would not happen. There are thousands of Hidden Codes in The Bible. Google: Bible Codes, for more info.\n\n\nObama said he was getting us out of Iraq and Afghanistan. So why are we now spending more money in Afghanistan NOW than we did for Iraq? THIS IS INSANITY. WE ARE INSANE TO KEEP PUTTING UP WITH THE LIES OUT OF WASHINGTON. ARREST THEN ALL AND TRY THEM FOR TREASON. NO DEATH SENTENCES. LIFE in Prison with NO NO NO chance for parole, LIFE at Hard labor. I mean bustin Rock with Sledge Hammers 12 hours a day. Maybe just for fun a little waterboarding too.\n\nThe More You share the More shares you will receive, may Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.   \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.    \n\nGet info on the Take Over by The New World Order Below  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.khouse.org/topical_bible_study&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net&lt;/a&gt; \nListen to Alex Jones  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bibledatabase.com/html_bibles.html&lt;/a&gt; \n \nSeed long and Prosper.  \n\nEphesians 5:11\n\n11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove (expose) them.\n\n\n\n\n                                   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a64b928131a9d9281edae77175f8f47fb6dfff8c","amp;dn":"POTHS+-+Conspiracy+Facts+-+Part+46+-+How+Weed+Won+The+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a64b928131a9d9281edae77175f8f47fb6dfff8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,75,146,129,49,169,217,40,30,218,231,113,117,248,244,127,182,223,255,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
