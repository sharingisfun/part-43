However in recent years it has also become a extremely powerful server to stream live and on demand video in several formats to our network and the Internet.\n\nIt started as a student project at the French ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°cole Centrale Paris but is now a worldwide project with developers from 20 countries.\n\nVLC is built in a modular way. This means that you can choose from a range of different modules to decide how to control VLC and how to display the video output.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n# Decoders:\n\nNative support for WMA Professional, without the use of the Win32 dlls\n\nFix issues in subtitles, especially SSA ones\n\nVarious fixes on theora and ogg\n\n\n# Demuxers:\n\nVarious fixes for EPG support in MPEG-TS demuxer\n\nFixes for potential stack overflow in .avi, .mp4 and .asf demuxers\n\n\n# Access:\n\nFixes for v4l2 devices\n\nFixes for dvb-c channels-scanning\n\n\n# Qt Interface:\n\nFix some playlist sorting issues\n\n\n# Encoders:\n\nMPEG2 transrate stream output removed\n\nx264 default-values closer to x264.exe defaults.\n\nx264 rc-behaviour fixes:\n- if user defines qp-value, CQP-mode is used\n- otherwise if user defines vb=0, CRF-mode is used\n- otherwise ABR-mode is used\n\nx264 set vbv-bufsize/vbv-maxsize better if user hasn't defined these:\n- ABR mode set vbv-max-bitrate=bitrate\n- vbv-bufsize is bitrate * seconds between keyframes (keyint/fps)\n\n\n# Playlist:\n\nLua scripts for Mpora and Vimeo playback\n\n\n# Translations:\n\nNew Kazakh and Croatian translations\n\nLithunanian translation is available on Windows\n\nGalician, Korean, Nepali, Vietnamese, Ukrainian, Brazilian, Arabic and French translation updates\n\n\nED2K Link:\ned2k://|file|vlc-1.0.2-win32.exe|18527244|0B82668419897EAF388B907196B18895|h=AZEXBRDN6GIB2OYPGVJERMVEX5EBNOIM|/\n\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nHere you have a long list of features in VLC media player: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ec34ab4ddce3d7ba1930326a73455c3216e57f","amp;dn":"VideoLAN+Client+%28VLC+media+player%29+1.0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ec34ab4ddce3d7ba1930326a73455c3216e57f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,236,52,171,77,220,227,215,186,25,48,50,106,115,69,92,50,22,229,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
