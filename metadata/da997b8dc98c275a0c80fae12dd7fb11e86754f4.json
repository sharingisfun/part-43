An old hand at the routine, StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s contention that his compendium can entertain anyone with math-class memories is amply borne out, and his ability to surprise is one reason. One never knows whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next: a proof that two plus two indeed equals four jostles with a spoof of proof itself. To keep readers on their toes, or at least flipping back to his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsuperlative storehouse of sneaky solutions,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Stewart flummoxes them with bizarre propositions, such as two plus two actually equals zeroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re doing modular arithmetic. Speaking of equality, the equal sign makes for a go-to topic for amusing vignettes, while stories about math underlying modern technology underscore the serious side of a subject with which Stewart makes such good sport. A great distraction for math mavens at any knowledge level. --Gilbert Taylor\nProduct Description\nOpening another drawer in his Cabinet of Curiosities, renowned mathematics professor Ian Stewart presents a new medley of games, paradoxes, and riddles in Professor StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hoard of Mathematical Treasures. With wit and aplomb, Stewart mingles casual puzzles with grander forays into ancient and modern mathematical thought.\n\nAmongst a host of arcane and astonishing facts about every kind of number from irrational and imaginary to complex and cuneiform, we learn:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How to organize chaos\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How matter balances anti-matter\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How to turn a sphere inside out (without creasing it)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ How to calculate pi by observing the stars\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and why you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t comb a hairy ball.\n\nAlong the way Stewart offers the reader tantalizing glimpses of the mathematics underlying life and the universe. Mind-stretching, enlightening, and endlessly amusing, Professor StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hoard of Mathematical Treasures will stimulate, delight, and enthrall.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Professor-Stewarts-Hoard-Mathematical-Treasures/dp/0465017754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302032403&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Professor-Stewarts-Hoard-Mathematical-Treasures/dp/0465017754/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1302032403&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da997b8dc98c275a0c80fae12dd7fb11e86754f4","amp;dn":"Hoard+of+Mathematical+Treasures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da997b8dc98c275a0c80fae12dd7fb11e86754f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,153,123,141,201,140,39,90,12,128,250,225,45,215,251,17,232,103,84,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
