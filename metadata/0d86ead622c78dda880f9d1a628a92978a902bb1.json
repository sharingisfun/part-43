As its title suggests, the fourteen track collection focuses solely on the group's best known tracks, including such classics as &quot;Psycho Killer,&quot; their commercial breakthrough cover of Al Green's &quot;Take Me to the River,&quot; &quot;Once In A Lifetime,&quot; and &quot;Burning Down the House,&quot; among others. But the inclusion of a pair of oddities, &quot;Sax and Violins&quot; and &quot;Lifetime Piling Up,&quot; will raise a few eyebrows, especially with such a backlog of stronger material that very easily could have fit alongside the renowned hits (namely &quot;Memories Can't Wait,&quot; &quot;Crosseyed and Painless,&quot; &quot;Swamp,&quot; &quot;Girlfriend is Better,&quot; etc.). But by and large, for a single disc collection, The Best Of (Once In A Lifetime) accomplishes its goal ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ hopefully one day a slightly more expanded version will see a stateside release.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Psycho Killer\n[02] Take Me To The River\n[03] Once In A Lifetime\n[04] Burning Down The House\n[05] This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\n[06] Slippery People - (Live)\n[07] Life During Wartime - (Live)\n[08] And She Was\n[09] Road To Nowhere\n[10] Wild Wild Life\n[11] Blind\n[12] (Nothing But) Flowers\n[13] Sax And Violins\n[14] Lifetime Piling Up\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:03m:20s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 157mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop Pubk\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 12 October 1992\n\nRecords Company    \t- EMI Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.talking-heads.nl \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.davidbyrne.com \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n\nCheck Me Out - Piratebay - Mininova - H33t - Demonoid - Torrentbox - Genesis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d86ead622c78dda880f9d1a628a92978a902bb1","amp;dn":"%5B1992%5D+The+Best+Of+Once+In+A+Lifetime+-+Talking+Heads+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d86ead622c78dda880f9d1a628a92978a902bb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,134,234,214,34,199,141,218,136,15,157,26,98,138,146,151,138,144,43,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
