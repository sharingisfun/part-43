There wasn't any information on the remastering in the CD, but it was an official release from Sangare's own label, so I assume the CD release was sourced from the original master tapes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee91086b78338a717b3add9a8288d27495ac209e","amp;dn":"Oumou+Sangare+-+Laban+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee91086b78338a717b3add9a8288d27495ac209e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,145,8,107,120,51,138,113,123,58,221,154,130,136,210,116,149,172,32,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
