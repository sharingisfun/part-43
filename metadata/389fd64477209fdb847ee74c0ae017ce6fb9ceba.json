And itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fair to say has no intention of leaving a life of crime behind him. Thanks to the book of contacts heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s accrued while inside, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s looking to put his newly found knowledge to commercial, and criminal, use.\n\nPlayed by Tom Hardy, in a strong leading turn, Jackson doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take long to get back to business. The Take lands him a London rife with gang warfare though, and we soon get the impression that this is not a safe place to be. Events start in the mid 1980s, and the narrative of the drama then covers the next decade, and the cultural and political changes that encompasses. And JacksonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quite go the way heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d envisagedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nCo-starring Brian Cox and Charlotte Riley, The Take packs plenty in over its four instalments, and it doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hold back on portraying just how brutal the London underworld can be. Yet itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gripping drama, nonetheless, spearheaded by a superb turn from Tom Hardy in the lead role. Granted, it crams too much into four episodes, and often has to gallop through events. Plus, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a familiarity to the narrative. But this is a gritty, well-released adaptation of a strong book, and worth seeking out. --Jon Foster\n\nSynopsis\nScreenwriter Neil Biswas' (BRADFORD RIOTS) adaptation of Martina Cole's novel THE TAKE, spans 10 years of British socio-political change. The backdrop of the Thatcher era and its transition into the birth of New Labour, is particularly relevant to the drama's theme of idealised new beginnings; stemming from and resulting in a sense of disillusion.\n\nFreddie Jackson (Tom Hardy, BRONSON, ROCKNROLLA) leaves prison in 1984, after serving 4 years for bank robbery. His loyal, if unstable, wife Jackie (Kierston Wareing, RISE OF THE FOOTSOLDIER) has waited for him on the outside, under the misguided impression that he wants to go straight. Freddie, however, is raring to get back into the game, keen on becoming king of the East End underworld. Cousin Jimmy (Shaun Evans, BOY A) is hot on his heels and, with time, rises the ranks of the quickly expanding crime empire -- eventually eclipsing Freddie himself. He also has something else Freddie covets, Jackie's younger sister Maggie (Charlotte Riley, WUTHERING HEIGHTS), and together they have a loving relationship the Jacksons can only dream of. Bitterness and jealously threaten to tear the family apart, as loyalties are brought into question, trusts are betrayed, and violence ensues. In an era of new promises and possibilities, everyone it appears, is on the take.\n\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 1 000 MiB\nDuration : 2h 56mn\nOverall bit rate : 792 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2009-07-20 01:17:21\nTagged date : UTC 2009-07-20 09:53:29\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.9.3 2008112300\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;723f131b1c323e465c42&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 2h 56mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 628 Kbps\nWidth : 716 pixels\nHeight : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate mode : Variable\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate : 12.500 fps\nMaximum frame rate : 86.022 fps\nResolution : 24 bits\nColorimetry : 4:2:0\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.061\nStream size : 793 MiB (79%)\nWriting library : x264 core 65\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nFormat settings, SBR : No\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 2h 56mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 230 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\nStream size : 202 MiB (20%)\nLanguage : English\nEncoded date : UTC 2009-07-20 01:17:21\nTagged date : UTC 2009-07-20 09:53:28","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389fd64477209fdb847ee74c0ae017ce6fb9ceba","amp;dn":"THE+TAKE+2009%40TFKC-H.264++RIP+BY+STIG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389fd64477209fdb847ee74c0ae017ce6fb9ceba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,159,214,68,119,32,159,219,132,126,231,76,10,224,23,206,111,185,206,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
