So it's pretty rare in this widescreen presentation.\n\n\nRegarding this movie:\n\nTitle:\nModern Girls\n\nCountry:\nUSA\n\nYear:\n1986\n\nDirector:\nJerry Kramer\n\nActors:\nCynthia Gibb\nVirginia Madsen\nClayton Rohner\nDaphne Zuniga\nChris Nash\nStephen Shellen\nRick Overton\nPamela Springsteen\nJosh Richman\nMartin Ferrero\nQuin Kessler\nSharron Shayne\n\nLength:\n80:33 min\n\nSource:\nDVB (MGM-Channel)\n\nVideo:\n720x400 ( AR: 1,80 )\n\nSound:\n2.0 stereo mp3\n\nLanguage:\nenglish\n\nFile size:\n743 MB (779.296.768 Bytes) -&gt; 1/6 of a DVD ( 2/12 in the &quot;system of 12th&quot; )\n\nRemarks:\n\nNice 80s comedy with a great cast.\n\nPlot from IMDB\nMargo, Kelly, and CeCe have three things in common: they're roomates, they're gorgeous, and they're hooked on the glamour and excitement of L.A.'s rock and roll night life. These dating Modern Girls are in for a night of their lives. Because tonight, their usual fun and games get hilariously funny and seriously dangerous when they get mixed up with a rock star, an arrogant ex-boyfriend, a pseudo-sadist, and the nicest nerd in The City Of Angels. It's a full night to say the least-full of fun, sex, laughs, and rock and roll!\n\n\n\nBonus:\nnone\n\n\n\nReleased:\nJanuary 9th, 2007\n\n\n\nRegarding the file size:\n\nI decided a while ago to use file sizes based on the size of a DVD instead of CD.\nSo basically I looked at the sizes suggested by AutoGK (1/6, 1/5, 1/4 of a DVD and so on)\nand created a system that made the most sense to me:\n\nDivide a DVD by 12 and use multiples of that.\n\n1/12 373,25 MB = 391.666.666 Bytes\n2/12 (1/6) 746,51 MB = 783.333.333 Bytes\n3/12 (1/4) 1119.78 MB = 1.175.000.000 Bytes\n4/12 (1/3) 1493,02 MB = 1.566.666.666 Bytes\n5/12 1866,28 MB = 1.958.333.333 Bytes\n\nI wouldn't use file sizes over 2 GB since those tend to cause problems with stand alone DVD player.\n\nNow movies can be freely combined and burnt to a DVD-Rom just by chosing files that add up to 12/12.\nOne could now take one really big sized move and combine it with medium sized movies\nand maybe a small one and still wouldn't waste any DVD capacity.\n\n\nAn example:\n\nOne big movie:\n5/12 1866,28 MB = 1.958.333.333 Bytes\n\nOne medium sized:\n3/12 (1/4) 1119.78 MB = 1.175.000.000 Bytes\n\nThis adds up to 8/12.\n4/12 left, so I could chose two movies of 2/12\nor one of 4/12\nor one of 3/12 and one of 1/12\nand so on\n\n\nWorst case would be to waste 1/12 because those file sizes will probably not be used that often,\nbut there are short features and DVD specials and so on, so that shouldn't happen often.\nIf combined the right way, it should never be necessary to waste space.\n\nI'll also set the size slightly under the target size to garantee that in the end 12/12 really fit a DVD\nand not exceed it by a few bytes.\n\nI hope you like that system. It's not completely new, I guess, but I never read about a real &quot;system&quot; before,\nso I tryed to build this one...at least for my own stuff.\nMaybe someone might like this, too and joins in.\n\nThis release:\n\nThe movie is 2/12 (1/6) of a DVD.
