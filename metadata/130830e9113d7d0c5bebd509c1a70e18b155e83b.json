The Pirate Bay and sites that pull torrents from it can be a few hours / days behind, but you can always get the latest torrent on the bottom of http://wikileaks.ch/cablegate.html\n\nIf you run a local WikiLeaks &quot;pull&quot; / &quot;scrape&quot; mirror (search P2P networks for &quot;wikileaks scrape&quot;), then extract this update in the Web path.  These 7z files can be extracted with WinRAR or 7zip for Windows, or p7zip for any operating system.\n\nThe bad guys can put up blocks to all HTTP mirrors at any time, which is why grabbing, seeding, and otherwise proliferating the latest torrents is very important!\n\nHTTP download mirror at http://alexlibman.com/dl/wikileaks/ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130830e9113d7d0c5bebd509c1a70e18b155e83b","amp;dn":"WikiLeaks+CableGate+update+for+January+31st%2C+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130830e9113d7d0c5bebd509c1a70e18b155e83b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,8,48,233,17,61,125,12,91,235,213,9,193,167,14,24,177,85,232,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
