In her presentations she exposes shocking and highly suppressed facts about our government poisoning us with radiation right at this very moment. Leuren documents every statement she makes with research documents, many of which use actual government data to draw their conclusions. Did you know that diabetes, autism and other forms of mental illness are caused by exposure to radiation?\n\nGlobal Nuclear Coverup - Leuren Moret _ 2005.mp4\nH.264, 432 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 320, Millions\nAAC, Stereo (L R), 48.000 kHz\n241.71 MB\n587.84 kbits/s\n57:06.62\n\nComment: It seems that not only have Iraqi people been poisoned by depleted uranium but Americans have been contaminated by radioactive materials too for many decades.
