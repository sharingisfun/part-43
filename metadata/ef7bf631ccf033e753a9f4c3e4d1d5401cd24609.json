This is Cal Tjader Live and at his best. Each performance is a Master Class. ~ Ed Bogas\n\nA 1972 live set, Live at the Funky Quarters is every bit of its time: Cal Tjader's vibraphone is supported by Al Zulaica's electric piano and John Heard's Jaco Pastorious-style bass-as-lead-instrument, giving the whole thing a fusiony sheen that will be the dealbreaker for many listeners. Those not constitutionally averse to early-'70s fusion will find much to enjoy here, however, as Tjader plays with his usual grace and fluidity, and Zulaica's electric piano solos are refreshingly free of Chick Corea-style overplaying. The jazz-rock-inflected reworkings of earlier Tjader favorites like &quot;Manteca&quot; and &quot;Soul Sauce III&quot; -- which features an amazing extended percussion breakdown section buoyed by Heard's rubbery bassline -- work surprisingly well, and newer material like &quot;Philly Mambo&quot; and the delicate allad &quot;Mother and Child&quot; is well-suited to the players' strengths. Most of this album can be found on the CD two-fer Descarga, but that release deletes a funky version of Tjader's tune &quot;Theme,&quot; so true fans will want to search for the original vinyl. ~ Mog.Com\n \nPersonnel:\nBass - John Heard \nCongas - Michael Smithe \nDrums - Dick Berk \nElectric Piano - Al Zulaica \nEngineer [Live] - Gary Stauffer \nEngineer [Remix] - Jim Stern \nProducer - Ed Bogas \nVibraphone, Percussion - Cal Tjader  \n\nCal Tjader - Live At The Funky Quarters Tracks:\n01 A1   Leyte (6:30) \n02 A2   Mother And Child (5:40) \n03 A3   Cubano Chant (4:54) \n04 A4   Soul Sauce III (5:48) \n05 B1   Philly Mambo (7:00) \n06 B2   Davito (4:10) \n07 B3   Manteca_Theme (7:00)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7bf631ccf033e753a9f4c3e4d1d5401cd24609","amp;dn":"Cal+Tjader+-+Live+At+The+Funky+Quarters+%281972%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7bf631ccf033e753a9f4c3e4d1d5401cd24609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,123,246,49,204,240,51,231,83,169,244,195,228,209,213,64,28,210,70,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
