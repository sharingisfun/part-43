One of country music's greatest stars, few can match the\n#\n   emotional range of Tucker's smoky vocals.\n#\n   Working with Grammy Award-winning producer Pete Anderson (Dwight Yoakam,\n#\n   Michelle Shocked, Roy\n#\n   Orbison, Sara Evans), Tucker completely transformed the delivery and meaning\n#\n   of the songs with her earthy, passionate and unflinching style. From\n#\n   heartbreaking to tough-as-nails, the recordings are powerful as Tucker wrings\n#\n   new, unexpected emotions from these classics.\n#\n   Guest artists include the Grascals, Jim Lauderdale and bluegrass stars Rhonda\n#\n   and Darrin Vincent, with\n#\n   producer Anderson playing guitar on every track.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b38450b960482e6533a856c48616595387b90c","amp;dn":"Country+-+Tanya_Tucker-My_Turn-2009-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b38450b960482e6533a856c48616595387b90c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,179,132,80,185,96,72,46,101,51,168,86,196,134,22,89,83,135,185,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
