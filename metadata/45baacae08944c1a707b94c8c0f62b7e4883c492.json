It is the second single from their eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown. The single was released through Reprise Records on May 25, 2009 as a digital download and July 14, 2009 as a CD single. The song has been a success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at #22, which has become their highest charting single since 2005.\nIt was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo/Group with Vocals and Best Rock Song in 2010. &quot;21 Guns&quot; has sold over 1,727,000 copies as of June, 2010.\n\nThe song is featured heavily in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and appears on the soundtrack, which was released on June 23, 2009. It became available for download on the music video game series Rock Band on July 7, 2009, along with the songs &quot;East Jesus Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;.\nThis song was featured in episode 6 of The Vampire Diaries.\n\n\nPlot\n\nThe video takes place with the band and the album's two protagonists Christian (Josh Boswell) and Gloria (Lisa Stelly) taking refuge in a white room after robbing a bank. The police arrive outside the room and open fire through the window. As bullets rain through the room, the band continues playing. Gloria picks up the phone and throws it into a fish tank. As the bullets continue to fly and tear apart the room, Christian and Gloria walk toward each other, unharmed by the bullets. They embrace and kiss, recreating the 21st Century Breakdown cover art. The video may represent the meaning of the song in the 21st Century Breakdown story.\n\nAfter spending the previous week at number 3, the video peaked at number one on VH1 Top 20 Countdown on August 22, 2009 and again on September 19, 2009. It also won &quot;Best Rock Video&quot;, &quot;Best Direction in a Video&quot; and &quot;Best Cinematography in a Video&quot; for the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n\nSnapshots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/913/21gunsgreendaymp4000004.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/913/21gunsgreendaymp4000004.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2692/21gunsgreendaymp4000099.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2692/21gunsgreendaymp4000099.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/9216/21gunsgreendaymp4000076.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img248.imageshack.us/img248/9216/21gunsgreendaymp4000076.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4723/21gunsgreendaymp4000238.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4723/21gunsgreendaymp4000238.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img709.imageshack.us/img709/4555/21gunsgreendaymp4000276.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img709.imageshack.us/img709/4555/21gunsgreendaymp4000276.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDetails\n\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFile size                        : 73.8 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 51s\nOverall bit rate                 : 2,121 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nDuration                         : 4mn 51s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1,998 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 3,745 Kbps\nWidth                            : [b]1,280 pixels[/b]\nHeight                           : [b]720 pixels[/b]\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                  : Constant\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\nStream size                      : 69.4 MiB (94%)\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nDuration                         : 4mn 51s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 124 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 246 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 4.30 MiB (6%)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45baacae08944c1a707b94c8c0f62b7e4883c492","amp;dn":"21+Guns+-+Greenday+%28HD+720p%29+%5Bmildpoison%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45baacae08944c1a707b94c8c0f62b7e4883c492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,186,172,174,8,148,76,26,112,123,148,200,192,246,43,126,72,131,196,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
