They originated not according to some single, all-explaining\npatternÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as is often sweepingly arguedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but in a wide variety of different ways and in response to a great many different social and pyschological needs.\n\nGrant and Hazel have provided a finely grained and authoritative dictionary-style reference that is quite handy for identification of any figure from classical mythology. The book will prove useful for keeping at one's side when reading Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, Euripides and company. Very helpful appendices include genealogical trees, alphabetical list of classical authors referred to, and clear and informative maps. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b13d601d7736af740b6135df8bda2aa6df546db5","amp;dn":"Who%5C%27s+Who+in+Classical+Mythology+%282002%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b13d601d7736af740b6135df8bda2aa6df546db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,61,96,29,119,54,175,116,11,97,53,223,139,218,42,166,223,84,109,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
