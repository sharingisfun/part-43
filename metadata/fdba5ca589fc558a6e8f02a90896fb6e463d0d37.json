It was written and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and stars Audie Murphy, Michael Redgrave, and Giorgia Moll. It was critically well-received, but was not considered a box office success.\n\n  Audie Murphy  ...  The American  \n  Michael Redgrave  ...  Thomas Fowler  \n  Claude Dauphin  ...

Greene was furious that his anti-war message was excised from the film, and he disavowed it as a &quot;propaganda film for America.&quot;  The Quiet American was remade in 2002, directed by Philip Noyce, with Brendan Fraser and Michael Caine, in a version more faithful to Greene's novel.\n\nThe Quiet American was filmed in Rome's CinecittÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Studios between January 28 and late April 1957, with some location shooting in Saigon, the first time a feature film was shot in Vietnam. The crew had some difficulty filming there ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they had to avoid shooting at noon because of the harsh shadows, they had trouble receiving permission to shoot inside a Buddhist temple because of moon's phase, and they indavertantly helped a political protest take place that would otherwise have been shut down by the police, because the authorities assumed it had been staged for the film.\n\nHumphrey Bogart was reported to have been considered to play the lead role, but it was first offered to Montgomery Clift, with Laurence Olivier to play &quot;Fowler&quot;. When Clift withdrew for reasons of health, Olivier also left the project.\n\nGraham Greene had been a war correspondant in Indochina, and was critical of the growing American involvement there. By making the character of &quot;Pyle&quot; an aid worker and private citizen and not a representative of the U.S. government, and by focusing on the love triangle aspects of the story instead of the geo-politics of the war, producer-director-writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz significantly diluted the impact of Greene's story, which led the author to disavow the film.\n\nPhoung is a young Vietamese woman, but actress Giorgia Moll is Italian.\n\nThe film's dilution of Greene's political point was mentioned by some critics, but the acting was nevertheless noted for its high quality, especially of Michael Redgrave. Also praised were the locations. Writing in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther said: &quot;Scenes shot in Saigon have a vivid documentary quality and, indeed, the whole film has an aroma of genuine friction in the seething Orient.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdba5ca589fc558a6e8f02a90896fb6e463d0d37","amp;dn":"The+Quiet+American+%5B1958%5D+Joseph+L.+Mankiewicz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdba5ca589fc558a6e8f02a90896fb6e463d0d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,186,92,165,137,252,85,138,110,143,2,169,8,150,251,110,70,61,13,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
