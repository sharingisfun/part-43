While never quite as inspiredly free-associative as James Brown at his best, their chanted catch phrases bridged the gap between threateningly tough and playground-ready. Gold collects high points that are still a joy to hear--can it be?--a quarter century after the band's peak. Never as clever as George Clinton with Parliament and Funkadelic they were able to have a mild success. Fire was the hit that brought them to my attention and their most popular tune ever. I remember collecting their albums mostly from the $1 cut out bins at the record stores. If the album turn out not to have any real hits at least I had a picture of a hot chic to enjoy. This collection in my opinion only is missing one song and that is &quot;Honey&quot; from the album with the same name. If anyone reading this has that CD will upload that album (in the .flac format of course) you will be a true friend.\n\nTrack Listings\n1. Feel the Beat (Everybody Disco)\n2. Love Rollercoaster\n3.
