The song was the first track to be released from the 1982 album Mirage, the fourth album by the band with Lindsey Buckingham acting as main producer with Richard Dashut and Ken Caillat.\n \n&quot;Hold Me&quot; was written by Christine McVie and Robbie Patton and it became one of Fleetwood Mac's biggest hits in the USA. Released in July 1982, it peaked at #4 for seven consecutive weeks.\n \nIn the UK, &quot;Hold Me&quot; was not a successful single. It was first released there in June 1982 and failed to chart. It became a quite a popular radio hit however, and it was eventually re-issued in February 1989 to promote the group's 1988 Greatest Hits package with &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; as the B-side. It only reached #94.\n\nFleetwood Mac are a British-American rock band formed in 1967 in London. The two most successful periods for the band were during the late 1960s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist Peter Green and achieved a UK number one with &quot;Albatross&quot;; and from 1975 to 1987, with more pop-orientation, featuring Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.\n\nThe only original member present in the band is its namesake drummer, Mick Fleetwood. Despite band founder Peter Green naming the group by combining the surnames of two of his former bandmates (Fleetwood, McVie) from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, bassist John McVie played neither on their first single nor at their first concerts. The keyboardist, Christine McVie, has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album Kiln House.\n(video has a mostly-transparent white &quot;vh1 classic&quot; logo at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Me_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Me_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaeIPAaDc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KaeIPAaDc&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9500kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Layer 2 Audio 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:39\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
