Of course, beautiful singing alone does not a great record make, and here Vernhes is on hand to infuse nuance into the album's arrangements. He puts to use a bevy of divergent instrumentation-- electric guitar, bass clarinet, various organs, a Colombian hand drum, and many others-- to add texture and unexpected flourishes of sound throughout. When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed  \n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/12/23/lia-ices/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89547746358dd50cf669a6ab4077efae34dc036e","amp;dn":"Lia+Ices...Necima%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89547746358dd50cf669a6ab4077efae34dc036e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,84,119,70,53,141,213,12,246,105,166,171,64,119,239,174,52,220,3,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
