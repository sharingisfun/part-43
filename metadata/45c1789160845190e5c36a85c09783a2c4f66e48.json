With Kleiner added to the band, Tub Ring adopted the\nsimilar sounds of Mr. Bungle. Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance\ntook note of Kleiner's passion and creativity and ended up\nproducing their first official full-length.\nEventually, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Tub Ring associated\nwith Dog Fashion Disco and Mindless Self Indulgence. For example,\nRob Kleiner filled in for Mindless Self Indulgence's injured\nGuitarist, Steve, Righ?, on the road in 2004 and 2005.\nOn December 10, 2005, Tub Ring came in second place during MTV2's\n&quot;Dew Circuit Breakout&quot; competition. Tub Ring performed two songs\nthroughout the competition including &quot;Future Was Free&quot; as well as a\ncover of Justin Timberlake's &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;.\nOn October 17, 2006, it was announced that the band had signed with\nthe experimental metal/rock record label The End Records on the\nlabel's official website. The band released their album, The Great\nFilter.1 on the first of May, 2007.\n\nDiscography\n\nDemos\n\nStupid Pet Tricks (1992)\nMusic for the Bathroom (1993)\n...And the Mashed Potato Mountain Etiquette (1995)\nSuper Sci-Fi Samauri Rockstar Ultra Turbo II (ver3.6) (1997)\n\nAlbums\n\nDrake Equation (June 12, 2001)\nBook of Water (December 5, 2001)\nFermi Paradox (October 15, 2002)\nZoo Hypothesis (August 17, 2004)\nThe Great Filter (May 1, 2007)\nSecret Handshakes (August 31, 2010)\n\n/team FKK\n\n01  stop this (now)                                  02:21\n02  bird of a different color                          02:18\n03  gold finger                                        03:02\n04  touching the enemy                                02:37\n05  burn                                              01:47\n06  cryonic love song                                  02:40\n07  feed the rapture                                  02:27\n08  flash                                              03:12\n09  i shot your faggot horse bitch                    02:45\n10  chronic hypersomnia                                03:20\n11  optimistic                                        02:53\n12  the day the world will end                        02:33\n13  tip of my tongue                                  02:04\n14  the horrible and the holy                          03:58\n\n37:57 min\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c1789160845190e5c36a85c09783a2c4f66e48","amp;dn":"Tub_Ring_-_Secret_Handshakes-2010-FKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c1789160845190e5c36a85c09783a2c4f66e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,193,120,145,96,132,81,144,229,195,106,133,192,151,131,162,196,246,110,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
