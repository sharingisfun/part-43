From here on, it's basically one masterpiece after another. Though not difficult works, technically speaking, they partake in full measure of Mozart's uniquely sensual brand of melody. That means that successful performances must know how to spin out a singing musical line, while at the same time making the most of the rare opportunities for soloistic display. Taste and musicianship are more important qualities than virtuosity, and that makes these pieces ideal vehicles for Arthur Grumiaux's aristocratic temperament and technical polish. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efdd43a49b8bf415af7d1b0f17f2a156e703b2a3","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+Complete+Violin+Concertos+-+Grumiaux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efdd43a49b8bf415af7d1b0f17f2a156e703b2a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,221,67,164,155,139,244,21,175,125,27,15,23,242,161,86,231,3,178,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
