Tracks such as &quot;Rebel Waltz&quot; on Sandanista, &quot;Sean Flynn&quot; on Combat Rock, &quot;Sleepwalk&quot; on Earthquake Weather and &quot;Mondo Bongo&quot; on Global-A-Go-Go all share a common vibe - lyrical and beautiful - which is sadly overlooked whenever people write or talk about Joe's music.\n\nThis CD was originally released in 1987 as the soundtrack to Alex Cox's film &quot;Walker&quot;. It inhabits similar musical and thematic territory to albums such as &quot;Straight To Hell&quot; and &quot;Earthquake Weather&quot;, but in my opinion &quot;Walker&quot; is far superior - an overlooked gem.\n\nThe music on this CD is mostly instrumental, with Joe providing the vocal on a few tracks, including the wonderful &quot;Unknown Immortal&quot;. &quot;Walker&quot; takes us on an exotic journey through Central and South American music, with Joe's passion and rough edges blending perfectly (just as Alex Cox mixes old and new references in the movie - Zippo Lighters, Cadillacs, Vietnam choppers, revolutionaries...) so we end up with a cocktail that is truly satisfying. Special mention must be given to Zander Schloss, whose guitar playing is exceptional throughout.\n\nIf you're going to name your bands &quot;Latino Rockabilly War&quot; and &quot;Mescaleros&quot; then I guess it must be in your blood. Listen to this CD on a hot and sultry evening... look up at the stars and remember Joe Strummer. \n\n.: Cover :.\n\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nFilibustero\nOmotepe\nSandstorm\nMachete\nViperland\nNica Libre\nLatin Romance\nThe Unknown Immortal\nMuskey Waltz\nThe Brooding Side of Madness\nTennesse Rain\nSmash Everything\nTropic of no Return\nTropic of Pico","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75228325b480a0475357e5e919c0625bf0ceacb4","amp;dn":"Joe+Strummer+-+Walker+OST+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75228325b480a0475357e5e919c0625bf0ceacb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,34,131,37,180,128,160,71,83,87,229,233,25,192,98,91,240,206,172,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
