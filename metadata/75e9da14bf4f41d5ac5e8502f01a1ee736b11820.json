Now in his third year of retirement, the celebrated master detective Sherlock Holmes announces to his old friend Dr. Watson his firm resolve to stay well out of the affairs of others. But this emphatic sentiment is to be short lived. At the behest of his enigmatic brother, Holmes is persuaded to investigate two unexplained, catastrophic train derailments that have caused the deaths of more than forty people. Why would a criminal wreck an express train? As the clues accumulate the most homicidal lunatic in Britain remains at large. Can even the strenuous efforts of Sherlock Holmes avert an international calamity and bring to justice this evil assassin? All is revealed in a tale that would make even the late Conan Doyle proud.\n\nUploader's note:\nThis book covers a time period of about 7-8 years up to 1914 including the events of His Last Bow. The writer even works in The Siege of Sidney Street (where a young Winston Churchill received a bullet through his top hat whilst wearing it!)\nThis is a cassette rip but not mine. What I did have I put through Audacity to get it sounding better. This is the results.\nI really liked the story and thought we needed something of quality to get over those cringing Holmes documentaries and films that I've uploaded recently. Besides I seem to get more comments for the audio books so don't be shy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e9da14bf4f41d5ac5e8502f01a1ee736b11820","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+Railway+Maniac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e9da14bf4f41d5ac5e8502f01a1ee736b11820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,233,218,20,191,79,65,213,172,94,133,2,240,26,30,231,54,177,24,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
