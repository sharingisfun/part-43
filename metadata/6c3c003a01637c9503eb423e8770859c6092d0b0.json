Their\ntwelfth full-length record, it takes in some typically off-the-wall\ninfluences, including Miles Davis and John Lennon. The group's\npsychedelic background may have informed their decision to draft in\nMGMT for a contribution to one track, and even Karen O from the Yeah\nYeah Yeahs makes an appearance on vocal duties. Recorded in\nguitarist/keyboardist Stephen Drozd's house, it is the first time the\nLips have attempted a double album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c3c003a01637c9503eb423e8770859c6092d0b0","amp;dn":"The_Flaming_Lips-Embryonic-2CD-2009-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c3c003a01637c9503eb423e8770859c6092d0b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,60,0,58,1,99,124,149,3,235,66,62,135,112,133,156,96,146,208,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
