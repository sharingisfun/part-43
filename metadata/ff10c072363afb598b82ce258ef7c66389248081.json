Books # 4 and 6 are bookmarked as well as all the other what is very useful for browsing.\n \n\n\nIncludes classics of the subject as well as contemporary best-sellers:\n\n\n1. Masters of the Mind: Exploring the Story of Mental Illness from Ancient Times to the New Millennium (Theodore Millon, 2004)\n\nThe compelling story of the quest to understand the human mind - and its diseases.\nThis engaging presentation of our evolving understanding of the human mind and the meaning of mental illness asks the questions that have fascinated philosophers, researchers, clinicians, and ordinary persons for millennia: What causes human behavior? What processes underlie personal functioning and psychopathology, and what methods work best to alleviate disorders of the mind? Written by Theodore Millon, a leading researcher in personality theory and psychopathology, it features dozens of illuminating profiles of famous clinicians and philosophers.\n\n\n2 Personality Disorders in Modern Life, 2nd Edition (Theodore Millon, 2004)\n\nExploring the continuum from normal personality traits to the diagnosis and treatment of severe cases of personality disorders, Personality Disorders in Modern Life, Second Edition is unique in its coverage of both important historical figures and contemporary theorists in the field. Its content spans all the major disorders-Antisocial, Avoidant, Depressive, Compulsive, Histrionic, Narcissistic, Paranoid, Schizoid, and Borderline-as well as their many subtypes. Attention to detail and in-depth discussion of the subtleties involved in these debilitating personality disorders make this book an ideal companion to the DSM-IV(TM).\n\n\n3. The Normal Personality: A New Way of Thinking About People (Steven Reiss, 2008)\n\nMany Psychologists regard personality and mental illness as closely related. The shadow of Freudian analysis looms over modern psychopathology, driving many psychologists to try to understand their clients' personal troubles and personalities using constructs developed to study mental illness. They believe that dark, unconscious mental forces that originated in childhood cause personality traits, personal troubles, and mental illnesses. Steven Reiss thinks problems are a normal part of life. In The Normal Personality, Reiss argues that human beings are naturally intolerant of people who express values significantly different from their own. Because of this intolerance, psychologists and psychiatrists sometimes confuse individuality with abnormality and thus over-diagnose disorders. Reiss shows how normal motives, not anxiety or traumatic childhood experiences, underlie many personality and relationship problems, such as divorce, infidelity, combativeness, workaholism, loneliness, authoritarianism, weak leadership styles, perfectionism, underachievement, arrogance, extravagance, stuffed shirt-ism, disloyalty, disorganization, and overanxiety. Based on a series of scientific studies, this book advances an original scientific theory of psychological needs, values, and personality traits. Reiss shows how different points on motivational arc produce different personality traits and values. He also shows how knowledge of psychological needs and values can be applied in counseling individuals and couples. The author describes new, powerful methods of assessing and predicting motivated behavior in natural environments including corporations, schools, and relationships.\n\n\n4. Popular Psychology - An Encyclopedia (Luis A. Cordon, 2005)\n\nThe 120 or so entries in this volume cover a wide range of topics, including, for example, Alien abduction, Birth order, Insanity defense, Mad cow disease, Multiple personality disorder, Parenting styles, and Satanic ritual abuse. Also represented are individuals such as Carl Jung and Dr. Phil. The goal is &quot;to try to counteract the tide of misleading information about the field of psychology with a concise guide to some things that the well-informed student of psychology and the interested general public ought to know.&quot;\nThe length of each entry varies from just a few lines to nine or more pages (for Memory) and there are a few black-and-white illustrations scattered throughout. Nearly all entries include a limited &quot;Further Reading&quot; list, generally offering both supporting and critical sources. Following the A-Z entries is an annotated bibliography that includes Web sites.\nThe book cover states readers will &quot;want to consult this work to understand what is good in the popular presentation of psychology and what is unworthy of serious attention.&quot; That may well be too expansive a goal as some topics that could have been valuable for both students and lay readers appear to be missing. Two specific contemporary topics that have apparently not been included are transpersonal psychology and tissue memory. Another curiously missing topic is counseling. In the entry Psychiatry, there is a relatively straightforward discussion of the difference in practice between psychiatrists and clinical psychologists. There is, however, no mention of counseling psychologists, though this discipline is licensed by most of the individual states and is also certified nationally in the U.S.\nPopular Psychology is easy to read, easy to browse, and would be of value in public and undergraduate libraries that have limited information on this topic. It would also be appropriate in high-school libraries, where it could be used as a basic reference for class-based study\n\n\n5. The Principles of Psychology - Vol I, II (William James, 1890)\n\nA famous long course, complete and unabridged. Widely considered to be the most important text in the history of psychology. Stream of thought, time perception, memory, experimental methods ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ these are only some of the concerns of a work that was years ahead of its time and is still valid, interesting and useful. Highly illustrated.\nJames has gathered together what he feels to be the most interesting and most accessible information for the beginning student. Psychology, according to James, deals with thoughts and feelings as its facts and does not attempt to determine where such things come from. This would be the realm of metaphysics, and he is careful to avoid crossing over from science into philosophy. This first volume contains discussions of the brain, methods for analyzing behavior, thought, consciousness, attention, association, time, and memory. Anyone wanting a thorough introduction to psychology will find this work useful and engaging.\n\n\n6. Psychopathology of Everyday Life (Sigmund Freud, 1901)\n\nThe most trivial slips of the tongue or pen, Freud believed, can reveal our secret ambitions, worries, and fantasies. The Psychopathology of Everyday Life ranks among his most enjoyable works. Starting with the story of how he once forgot the name of an Italian painter-and how a young acquaintance mangled a quotation from Virgil through fears that his girlfriend might be pregnant-it brings together a treasure trove of muddled memories, inadvertent actions, and verbal tangles. Amusing, moving, and deeply revealing of the repressed, hypocritical Viennese society of his day, Freud's dazzling interpretations provide the perfect introduction to psychoanalytic thinking in action.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff10c072363afb598b82ce258ef7c66389248081","amp;dn":"Psychology+%26+Personality+Disorders+-+UPDATED+on+Oct.+10th+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff10c072363afb598b82ce258ef7c66389248081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,16,192,114,54,58,251,89,139,130,206,37,142,247,198,99,137,36,128,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
