However, when you take it on your travels you are unable to connect to any wireless \n\nnetwork.  You're frustrated, you've asked a friend to help, you've been to the PC repair store ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and \n\nstill no joy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you can use wireless only in your own home !!  This is where The Ultimate \n\nTroubleshooter (TUT) comes in :  load it, and immediately it identifies for you the background task \n\nwhich is causing this nightmare.  And the irony :  the wireless router installation CD sent to you by \n\nyour Internet Service Provider installed that task, and, naturally, you never suspected it might be \n\nthe cause of all your problems.   See what's new in Version 4 ! \n\nThis is just one of the many benefits which have made The Ultimate Troubleshooter (TUT) the PC Tuning \n\nand PC Troubleshooting tool of choice for Home Users, Small Businesses, and IT Specialists and Large \n\nCorporations alike.  TUT is PC healthcare, PC repair, PC tuning, and PC maintenance in Plain English\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\nAfter downloading several torrents for this I had problems with the keygens they supplied having \n\ntrojans.  I discovered I had a keygen from DVT for version 4.64 that did not report a trojan so I've \n\nput this torrent together with that keygen which works with version 4.92 as well. I have installed on \n\nthree machines, 2 Windows 7 and XP Pro SP3 with no problems.  Enjoy!\n\nBikerbone\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed73d9543cd0be35236ca3cb0f604ce174a5e193","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Troubleshooter+4.92","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed73d9543cd0be35236ca3cb0f604ce174a5e193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,115,217,84,60,208,190,53,35,108,163,203,15,96,76,225,116,165,225,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
