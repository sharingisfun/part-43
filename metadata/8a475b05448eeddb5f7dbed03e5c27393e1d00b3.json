This package was built using ArchLinux and also \ntested on Ubuntu 10.04, it should work properly on any Linux distribution\n with wine properly installed.\n\nTo install the game run rs_installer.sh. This will extract the archive \nto ~/.wine/wineprefixes/RosettaStone. \n\nThis package only contains the main rosetta stone application.\nYou will need to install at least one language for this to be useful.\n\nTo install a language, mount the iso or CD to /media/cdrom, then run \n~/bin/RosettaStone, and add the language as normal.\n\nIf you do not mount the CD to /media/cdrom it will not be detected.\n\nYou can find language packs on your favorite torrent site, I personally\ntested this one: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bitsnoop.com/rosetta-stone-v-3-swedish-level-1-3-q911554.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bitsnoop.com/rosetta-stone-v-3-swedish-level-1-3-q911554.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you don't know how to mount an ISO here is an example:\nsudo mount -o loop /path/to/somelanguage.iso /media/cdrom\n\nTo launch the application execute the script located in ~/bin, either by double \nclicking on it, or from a terminal enter: &quot;~/bin/RosettaStone&quot; (case \nsensative). \n\nI reccomend adding $HOME/bin to your PATH, especially if you \nwant to use more then one corkscrew. \nA desktop launcher is not included with this release, but you can easily make one \nyourself using the included icon.\n\nTo uninstall delete the RosettaStone folder in ~/.wine/wineprefixes.\n\nI encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other applications \nand games. This package along with the installer can be freely redistributed \nand/or modified only by qualified software pirates. If you are happy to see a game \nor program you like running on linux be sure to let the developers know. \n\nFor other packages just search &quot;CorkScrew&quot; on your favorite torrenting site. \n\nAny requests/feedback/questions/issues/comments/virgin offerings, are welcome. \nContact me on Demonoid:or leave a comment \non thepiratebay, i check both regularly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a475b05448eeddb5f7dbed03e5c27393e1d00b3","amp;dn":"CorkScrew+Rosetta+Stone+For+Linux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a475b05448eeddb5f7dbed03e5c27393e1d00b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,71,91,5,68,142,237,219,95,125,190,208,62,92,39,57,62,29,0,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
