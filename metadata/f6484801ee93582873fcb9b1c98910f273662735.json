He meets some of the people who have undergone pioneering heart operations and the scientists who are pushing the limits of cardiac treatment.\n\nWe meet a man who has had his heart replaced with an artificial one powered by a mechanical pump he carries around in a rucksack, and witness a scientist bring a dead animal heart back to life on a workbench.\n\nPlus, the work of an American scientist who is using stem cells to turn what she calls a 'ghost heart' - the scaffold of a heart - into a replacement heart for humans.\n\n---------------------------------\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1640kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9) \nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime per Part 59.mins \nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 747 MB\nSource: DVB-rip (BBC- HD)\nEncoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6484801ee93582873fcb9b1c98910f273662735","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+2011+-+How+to+Mend+a+Broken+Heart+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6484801ee93582873fcb9b1c98910f273662735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,72,72,1,238,147,88,40,115,252,185,177,201,137,16,242,115,102,39,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
