He has been called &quot;the father of Swedish music&quot;, &quot;the Swedish HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndel&quot; and the &quot;Inovator and reformer of Swedish Church Music&quot;.\n\nRoman spent six years (1715-1721) in London and there studied with Johann Christoph Pepusch and met Francesco Geminiani and the great HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndel whose music he admired. Roman returned to Sweden at the age of 27 and was appointed Deputy Master and six years later became Chief Master at the Swedish Royal Orchestra. Aside from being a composer, he was a performer. The violin and oboe were his favorite instruments.\n\n--The Swedish Mass (Then Svenska Messan)-- \nIt is easy to hear HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndel's influence upon Roman in this piece. The mass was first performed in 1752 at Ekeblad residence in Stockholm by the Royal Court Orchestra and Adolf Fredrik's private orchestra, bolstered by cantors from the churches of Stockholm and oboists from the military guards along with as many competetant amatuers as could be engaged. This was Roman's last large work for orchestra and choir.\n\nThis version is sung in the original Swedish and was recorded over two concerts during October 1983 in the Alfred Fredrik Church, Stockholm. It features the 'Alfred Fredrik Bach Choir' and the 'Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble' and three outstanding Swedish soloists (Mikael Samuelson: Baritone, Anne-Sofie von Otter: Mezzo-soprano, Hillevi Martinpelto: Soprano) - Conducted by Anders ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œhrwall.\n\n--Track List (English)--\n01 Lord, Have Mercy On Us\n02 Glory To God In The Highest\n03 And On Earth Peace\n04 We Praise Thee\n05 We Give thanks To Thee\n06 Lord God\n07 Heavenly King\n08 Son Of The Father, Only Begotten\n09 Lord God, Lamb Of God\n10 Thou Who Sittest At The Right Hand Of God Our father\n11 Thou Who Takest Away The Sins\n12 For Thou Only Art Holy\n13 With The Holy Spirit\n\n\n--Track Detail (Swedish)--\nKYRIE\n01 Choir: Herre fÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rbarma tig\n\nGLORIA\n02 Choir: ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ra vare Gud\n03 Choir: Och frid pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ jordene\n04 Aria (Soprano): Vi lofve tig\n05 Choir: Vi tacke tig\n06 Aria (Soprano, Alto) &amp; Choir: O Herrre Gud himmelske konung\n07 Aria (Soprano): O Herre Gud himmelske konung \n08 Aria &amp; Duet (Soprano, Alto): O Herre thens aldra hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gstes enfÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶dde Son \n09 Aria (Alto): O Herre Gud Guds Lamb \n10 Duet (Soprano, Baritone): Tu som sitter pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ Fadrens hÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶gra hand\n11 Choir: Tu som borttager vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rldenes synder\n12 Choir: Ty tu ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤st allena helig\n13a.
