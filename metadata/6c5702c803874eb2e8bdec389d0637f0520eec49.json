Most are DeltaGlider or Dan Steph's DeltaGlider IV, but some are Doug Beachy's Altea Aerospace XR2 RavenStar.\n\nCoolest one is KFC to ascension island in less than 20 minutes, cruising inverted in the atmosphere at 11.5 km/sec (well above escape velocity) and doing one of the most extreme tactical landings that not even a crack C-17 pilot would do (in a real C-17 anyway) - with no in-flight thrust reversers or retro thrust - airbrakes only.  Also has video with a crazy low-delta-V trajectory to mars with aerobrake.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c5702c803874eb2e8bdec389d0637f0520eec49","amp;dn":"Orbiter+Space+Flight+Simulator+2006+%26+2010+-+29+Vids+by+TexFilms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c5702c803874eb2e8bdec389d0637f0520eec49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,87,2,200,3,135,78,178,232,189,236,56,157,6,55,240,82,14,236,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
