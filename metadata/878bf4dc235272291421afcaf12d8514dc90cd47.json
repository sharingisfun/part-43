Coming together in the first year of the new century, the group quickly gained a reputation for powerful rock. Combing the live intensity of Quicksand with more exploratory guitars and a newly melodic singing approach from Schreifels, Rival School took the urgency of the new metal trend and gave it a solid heart and a thoughtful mind. \n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Post Hardcore, Alternative\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
