She sounds uniformly great, but it's only one side of the Ross story. Of course, those who didn't like hearing her doing disco, funk, and pop/dance will find this a bargain. Among the featured songs are &quot;You're All I Need to Get By,&quot; &quot;I'm Still Waiting,&quot; &quot;My Man (Mon Homme),&quot; &quot;Touch Me in the Morning,&quot; &quot;All of My Life,&quot; &quot;Love Me,&quot; &quot;Theme from Mahogany,&quot; &quot;Sparkle&quot; and &quot;Endless Love.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nAll The Great Love Songs\n========================\n\n01.
