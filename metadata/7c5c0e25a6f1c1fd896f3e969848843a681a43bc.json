The central catch behind this unusual production is the locale: the play will be conducted at the local steelworks. Zelenka's central narrative crisscrosses two spheres of reality - the documentary-like sphere of the actors playing the characters, and the more traditional cinematic narrative involving the characters in the play itself. Soon, distinct, haunting parallels between the two begin to emerge. Then, an unexpected tragedy arrives from out of left field that brutally impacts one of the spectators of the play, and further echoes the structure and preoccupations of the tale in the original novel. Throughout, Zelenka explores one central theme: that of intellectuals and their moral accountability to a world that has lost both spiritual faith and a bedrock of ethos.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Karamazovi (2008) by pdm.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 39mn\n      Bit rate : 1961 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 9.09 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 39mn\n      Bit rate : 1508 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.345\n      StreamSize : 1.05 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 39mn\n      Bit rate : 446 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, Subwoofer\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 318 MiB\n\nCzech audio; English srt, Czech and English subpack\n\nPosted at KG by janatas, rip by PODiUM ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5c0e25a6f1c1fd896f3e969848843a681a43bc","amp;dn":"Karamazovi+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5c0e25a6f1c1fd896f3e969848843a681a43bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,92,14,37,166,241,193,253,137,111,62,150,152,72,132,58,104,26,67,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
