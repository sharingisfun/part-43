David Koepp (War of the Worlds) is adapting \nthe book by author John Godey.This version of The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 splits the Walther Matthau character of Walter Garber into \ntwo persons (Denzel Washington as MTA Dispatcher Walter Garber, and John Tutorro as NYPD Hostage Negotiator Detective Camonetti), \nboth of whose ordinary day is thrown into chaos by an audacious crime: the hijacking of a subway train that is in Garbers charge. \nJohn Turtorro plays the chief Hostage Negotiator who finds he is a fish out of water without Garber.John Travolta co-stars as Ryder, \nthe criminal mastermind who, as leader of a highly-armed gang of four, including a subway-knowledgeable henchman, (played by Luis \nGuzman), threatens to execute the train's passengers unless a large ransom is paid within one hour. As the tension mounts beneath \nhis feet, Garber employs his vast knowledge of the subway system in a battle to outwit Ryder and save the hostages.Camonetti starts \nthe movie taking charge of the situation, suspecting Garbers complicity, but realizes his mistake when his actions cause the death \nof a hostage. Realizing that only Garber can solve the problem, he spends the rest of the movie making Garbers job easier by becoming \nthe Liaison between his SWAT Team and Garber. In the end, it is Garber who solves the riddle of how the criminals intend to get away \nwith the money.\n\n \nDenzel Washington ... Walter Garber\nJohn Travolta ... Ryder\nLuis GuzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n ...
