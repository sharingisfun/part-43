While in school, he befriends Twinkie, a &quot;military brat.&quot; Twinkie introduces him to the world of racing in Japan. Though forbidden to drive, he decides to race against D.K., the &quot;Drift King&quot;, who has ties to the Yakuza, and loses, totaling the car because of his lack of knowledge of drifting, racing that involves dangerous hair pin turns. To repay his debt, he enters the underground world of drift street racing. As he becomes better and better, he must finally prove his worth in that world by once again racing D.K.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFast &amp; Furious\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nVideo Resolution.....: 853 x 352 (640x352 Container)\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.37 Mbps\nPoster Art...........: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/pfastandfurious4-1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/pfastandfurious4-1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nScreen Shots.........: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f41.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f41.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f42.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f42.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f43.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f43.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f44.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/RS%20Shots/f44.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDb Link............:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013752/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1013752/&lt;/a&gt;\nIMDb Description.....: Heading back to the streets where it all began, two men rejoin two women to blast muscle, tuner and exotic cars across Los Angeles and floor through the Mexican desert. When a crime brings them back to L.A., fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto reignites his feud with agent Brian O'Connor. But as they are forced to confront a shared enemy, Dom and Brian must give in to an uncertain new trust if they hope to outmaneuver him. And from convoy heists to precision tunnel crawls across international lines, two men will find the best way to get revenge: push the limits of what's possible behind the wheel.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis was a request ... and it was fairly easy to fill since I'd already encoded these months ago.  Just had to dig them up and put them in a folder :D\n\nIf you're into hot cars and hot bods, this film series aims to please.  Full of adrenaline, action, horrible acting, and not enough bare skin, the films are a stereotypical thrill-ride of action, violence, and sexy people.  But there's nothing wrong with that at all ...\n\n\nTRIVIA:\n1.  For those interested, Tokyo Drift is the third film, but since we see that Han is alive and kicking at the beginning of Fast &amp; Furious, obviously the film precedes Tokyo Drift.  So if you're looking to watch the films in chronological order, be sure to watch Tokyo Drift LAST.\n2.  Most people don't know, there's an extra minute of footage after the credits of the first film.\n3.  When they arrived on set of the first film, neither Michelle Rodriguez nor Jordana Brewster had a driver's license or learner's permits.  \n4.  For those who don't know, when Dom tells Brian at the house party, &quot;You can have any beer you want, as long as it's a Corona.&quot; ... this is a homage to Automotive Father, Henry Ford who is often credited with the phrase, &quot;You can have any color you want, as long as it's black.&quot;  Even though, the car he was referring to, the Model-T, actually came in several colors other than black, but black was by far the most common.\n5.  To achieve maximum realism, the director of Tokyo Drift refused to use CGI &quot;drift-sequences&quot; and rather used professional drift and rally drivers to perform all of the drifting scenes.\n6.  The yellow viper seen in 2 Fast 2 Furious was one of the first four &quot;new shape&quot; Production Dodge Vipers that the studio got &quot;on loan&quot; to use for shooting on the understanding they would not be damaged at all.  The Dodge Viper design and production team even sent representatives with each car and their presence was somewhat disruptive.  Because of this, the first car you see destroyed in the subsequent film is ... yes, a Dodge Viper.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAdditional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!
