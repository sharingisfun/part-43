The film will be screened as part of the festival's Panorama section.\n\nNienasycenie was screened at the Festival of Polish Feature Films in Gdynia. The film stars Cezary Pazura, who is featured in three different roles. The actor portrays the father of the main character, Zypcio; the crazed, corrupt and undervalued composer and pianist Putricydes Tengier; and the depraved quartermaster Kocmoluchowicz.\n\nAlongside Pazura, the film features Pazura's wife and the film's producer Weronika Marczuk-Pazura (as Persa), as well as Michal Lewandowski (Zypcio), Katarzyna Gniewkowska (Duchess Irina Wsiewolodowna), Leon Niemczyk (the Old Duke) and Arkadiusz Jakubik (Sturfan/Wang).\n\nThe film was produced by an international team made up of Polish and Lithuanian film professionals and was filmed in Lithuania. Most of the outdoor scenes in the film were shot at the Lithuanian Film Studio in Vilnius. Renowned jazz artist Leszek Mozdzer composed the music.\n\nDirector Wiktor Grodecki with his film Insatiability adapts Stanislaw Igncay WitkiewiczÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s provocative 1930ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel about the collapse of Western civilization as seen thought the eyes of confused 18-year-old boy.\n\nThe stunningly handsome young hero is an idealistic heir to a large brewery in Poland.  He is corrupted by the advances of both the decadent Princess Irina, who is after his money, and the court jester, the mad gay hunchback monk, who is after his virginity.  Set against a futuristic invasion of China into Eastern Europe, Insatiability  is a wild cinematic ride, a cornucopia comprised of black comedy, sex romp and satiric socioeconomic dogma.\n\nTrying to do a combination of Pier Paolo Pasolini and Pedro Almodovar, Witkor GrodeckiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Insatiability (2003) tells the tale of a young 18-year-old man who is coming of age at the time when Fascism is coming to Poland.  Though none of the sex or violence is quite as graphic as PasoliniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work, (especially Salo, which the case provocatively notes,) it eventually becomes very political and smart after a slow start.\n\nHe has money and along with his looks, blond hair and attractive body, he is a target for so many things and faster than you can say Fox &amp; his friends, finds himself in the middle of the growing madness as all kinds of situations and other personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-interest conspire to create mass chaos.  The original Stanislaw Igncay Witkiewicz book was set in the 1930s, but this film version is set in a strange near future where China is invading Poland.  At 128 minutes, it wears thin faster than expected, but if interested in the material, it is worth your time.\n\n\nMethod Fest \n2004  Won Best Director Wiktor Grodecki \n \nPolish Film Awards  \n2004  Nominated Eagle Best Costume Design (Najlepsze Kostiumy) Daiva Petrulyte \n2004  Nominated Eagle Best Film Score (Najlepsza Muzyka) Leszek Mozdzer \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2b384a0d08fc3bba33632ea003c228197ea2c0","amp;dn":"Nienasycenie+%28eng+sub%29+%5B2003%5D+Wiktor+Grodecki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2b384a0d08fc3bba33632ea003c228197ea2c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,43,56,74,13,8,252,59,186,51,99,46,160,3,194,40,25,126,162,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
