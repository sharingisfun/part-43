If you prefer the hands-on approach, FixTunes makes manually updating \nyour songs easy as well. You can type in the information you want directly or you \ncan search the music database from within the FixTunes program. Searching the \ndatabase makes it easy to browse directly to the correct artist / album / song \ncombination ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ even if you arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sure what they are supposed to be. FixTunes will \nread and save both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags to your MP3 song files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ including artist, \nalbum, title, track, year genre, comments and album cover art. \n\nAlbum Cover Art\nFixTunes will automatically download the album cover art images for your songs \nfrom the Internet and add them to your files. Many music programs (including \niTunes) will display the album cover art image of the currently playing song if \nthe image has been saved inside the fileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ID3 tags. In addition to the traditional\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ view of your music library, FixTunes allows you to browse your music by \nalbum cover. Album art is organized by Artist, Genre or Year allowing you to \nquickly scan your music collection. \n\nRename and Organize Your Music Library\nUsing FixTunes, you can easily organize thousands of music files into folders on \nyour hard drive. FixTunes will ask you how you want your files names (for example: \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArtist Name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Song Title (Track Number).mp3? and what type of folder structure \nyou want to organize the files into (for example: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMusic Folder Artist Name Album \nfileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). All you have to do is answer a few questions and FixTunes takes care of \nthe rest. FixTunes will also detect duplicate files and move the duplicate with \nthe lower file size to a special duplicates directory that you can go through at \nyour leisure. \n\nAutomated Organization\nHow long would it take you to manually go through all of your music and type in \nthe correct information? With FixTunes, your entire music collection can be fixed \nand organized with just a few clicks. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how it works:\nStep 1: FixTunes scans your computer / music folder(s) and finds your music files.\nStep 2: With two clicks, you tell FixTunes to begin looking the correct info for \n        your music files from the online database.\nStep 3: Once the correct information has been downloaded, you simply tell FixTunes \n        (with one click) to fix and organize your music files.

From within the program, you have one-click access to a \nvariety of sources including Google searches, Amazon.com catalog information, \nartist biographical info from Wikipedia and Amazon.com similar albums lists.\nFixTunes will also display details on the current album directly in the programs \ninterface: Artist, label, year, genres and track listings (so you can easily see \nwhich tracks you have and which you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t). \n\nSearch Your Music\nFixTunes makes every part of the library editing experience easy. There is always \na search field visible on the program that will display search results of your \nmusic files as you type. You can quickly find the songs you are looking for and \nedit their information, view catalog data or album art all within the same window.\n\nMusic Database\nThe power behind FixTunes is a huge music database with information on over \n4 million songs, albums and artists.

The database links to other music sources on the \nInternet, allowing FixTunes to download album art for your songs and give you \none-click access to artist bios and additional catalog information. \n\nEasy to Use\nFixTunes is easy to use.

Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at sept, 13 2009 - 23.45 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c913750df53afbfb06660b38b9c134005f4e2cc","amp;dn":"FixTunes+v4.82+%28Non-iTunes+Version%29+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c913750df53afbfb06660b38b9c134005f4e2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,145,55,80,223,83,175,191,176,102,96,179,139,156,19,64,5,244,226,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
