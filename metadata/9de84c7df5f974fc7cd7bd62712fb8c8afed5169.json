The comic, which is set in the year 2274, is notable for featuring early work by Grant Morrison, including the epic and apocalyptic Black Zoid storyline.\n\nOn the back of the title Secret Wars, it gained its own weekly title, Spider-Man and Zoids. The comicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anthology included reprints of Spider-Man stories and an original series of Zoids tales. The latter has no continuity with any Japanese anime (which didn't exist at the time) and it was created to go along with the original UK (and subsequently Australian) release of model kits.\n\nThe Zoids were created by a blue-skinned humanoid race named the Zoidaryans, native to the planet Zoidstar.  After the Zoidaryans apparently died out automated factories have produced legions of Zoids that continue to battle on, manned by androids, even though their creators have disappeared.  They are divided by two warring factions, the Blue Zoids and the Red Zoids.\nThe Red Zoids, led by Redhorn, land on Zoidstar and attempt to seize control of it. Threatened by these outsiders, the Blue Zoids temporarily cease their combat and unite under the mighty Zoidzilla to drive them off. Total war breaks out, with Redhorn forcibly converting Blue Zoids into red. \nInto this melee crashes the Celeste, a terran starship. The crew were transporting prison convicts to Zoidstar, believing it to be an uninhabited world where they can build a prison. The ship is blasted out of the sky by a fireball, stranding a few survivors on Zoidstar. Under the command of Captain Drew Heller, they are band together and attempt to survive and escape Zoidstar.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9de84c7df5f974fc7cd7bd62712fb8c8afed5169","amp;dn":"Zoids+%28Marvel+UK%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9de84c7df5f974fc7cd7bd62712fb8c8afed5169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,232,76,125,245,249,116,252,124,215,189,98,113,47,184,200,175,237,81,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
