You can create your own shadow puzzles in an edit mode within ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ShadowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also be able to fight it out online via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection as well as local multiplayer games.\n\nAs with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Tetris PartyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll again be able to use the Wii Balance Board as well as the Wii Wheel and Wii Speak and integrate your own Mii character to customize your own Tetris games.\n\nI quite enjoyed the first one, and if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s anything to go by, then Tetris Party Deluxe could be another hit for the Tetris name. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no AAA title, but it should be great fun and keep you entertained for hours on end.\n\nTetris Party Deluxe is set to hit the shelves over in the States in June but no release date has yet been released for the European version of the game, but I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see it being that far behind.\n\nPoster: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/4017/981421150060front692668.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/4017/981421150060front692668.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2325/98142120100224790screen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/2325/98142120100224790screen.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa516a1bf5b59784cbf0c27e4002eefed667703","amp;dn":"Tetris.Party.Deluxe.USA.WII-ProCiSiON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa516a1bf5b59784cbf0c27e4002eefed667703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,165,22,161,191,91,89,120,76,191,12,39,228,0,46,239,237,102,119,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
