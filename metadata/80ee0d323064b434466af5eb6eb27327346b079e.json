Sometime later, her head is taken to forensic entomologist John McGregor (Donald Pleasence) by Inspector Rudolf Geiger (Patrick Bauchau) and his assistant, Kurt (Michele Soavi). McGregor estimates the time of death as eight months prior.\nJennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly), insect-loving daughter of a movie star, arrives at the Swiss Richard Wagner Academy for Girls, chaperoned by Frau BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner (Daria Nicolodi), who places her with roommate Sophie (Federica Mastroianni). While sleepwalking through the academy and out onto the roof, Jennifer witnesses a student being murdered. She awakens and falls, fleeing into the village and eventually becoming lost in the woods. McGregor's chimpanzee attendant Inga (Tanga) finds her and leads her to him. Witnessing her apparent interaction with his insects, McGregor comes to believe she has a special gift for telepathy with them. After sheltering with him overnight, she returns to the academy and is subjected to a brain scan by the school doctor (Antonio Maimone) in a bid to cure her somnambulism.\nFollowing an ilicit tryst the same night, Sophie is murdered. Sleepwalking once again, Jennifer finds herself outside the school building and in guided by a firefly to a maggot-covered glove. When other students taunt Jennifer for her connection to insects, she summons a swarm of flies which covers the entire building, then faints. Convinced that Jennifer is insane and possibly responsible for the killings, the headmistress arranges for her to be transferred to a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Jennifer flees to McGregor's home just in time to evade the transfer.\nMcGregor identifies the maggots as those of the Great Sarcophagus fly, which is drawn to decaying human flesh. He gives one to Jennifer in a glass case and suggests she use it to help track the murderer. Near the now abandoned house where Vera Grandt was attacked, the fly becomes agitated, leading Jennifer to discover a severed hand but she is frightened off by a real estate agent. Inspector Geiger arrives moments later and learns that the house was abandoned eight months ago.\nLater that night, McGregor is murdered in his home after Inga is distracted and locked outside. Wandering the woods, the chimpanzee discovers a straight razor in a garbage bin. With nowhere left to go, Jennifer calls her father's lawyer Morris Shapiro for help. Instead of sending cash for a plane ticket, however, he alerts BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner, who finds Jennifer at the bank waiting for the money to be wired. Jennifer agrees to stay at BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner's house overnight.\nOnce there, BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner explains that the mirrors are all covered because they upset her son, who is profoundly mentally disabled. She then demands that Jennifer take some anti-fever pills. The girl agrees and locks herself in the bathroom for privacy, but after finding more maggots in the room she purges the pill. Enraged, BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner knocks Jennifer unconscious with a piece of lumber and imprisons her in the house.\nMeanwhile, Inspector Geiger arrives after learning that BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner was the tenant of the house where Vera Grandt was attacked. Shortly afterward, he can be heard screaming as Jennifer engineers her escape through a large hole in the floor that leads through a tunnel to a dungeon. Geiger, disfigured and chained to the wall, grabs at her and she tumbles into a pool full of decaying, maggot-infested corpses. BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner appears and attempts to finish them off, but Geiger frees himself and holds her off long enough to allow Jennifer to escape.\nIn the basement, Jennifer finds BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner's son, Patua (Davide Marotta), with a hideously deformed face. He chases Jennifer onto a motorboat and attempts to kill her, but she summons a swarm of flies that attack him. They eat away large portions of his flesh before causing him to drown in the lake. Swimming ashore, she is greeted by Morris Shapiro (Mario Donatone), who has arrived in response to her earlier phone calls. Before he can rescue her, BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner appears out of the darkness and decapitates him. Moments later, Inga arrives and kills BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ckner with the razor.
