He identifies with devastating examples all the most common fallacies popularly used in argument. We all like to think of ourselves as clear-headed and logical - but all readers will find in this book fallacies of which they themselves are guilty. The author shows you how to simultaneously strengthen your own thinking and identify the weaknesses in other people's arguments. And, more mischievously, Pirie also shows how to be deliberately illogical - and get away with it. This book will make you maddeningly smart: your family, friends and opponents will all wish that you had never read it. \n\n# Author: Madsen Pirie\n# Publisher: Continuum (November 2007)\n# Paperback: 182 pages\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0826498949\n# ISBN-13: 978-0826498946\n\n\n*** Knowledge is power.
