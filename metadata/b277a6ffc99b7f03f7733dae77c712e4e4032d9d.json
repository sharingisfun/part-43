Each adventure is initiated by a request by a different woman for Lord Zimbabwe to help her.\n\n\nLord Zimbabwe - Nick Romero\nDoctor Lilac - Dan Freedman\nTheremin - Peter Donaldson\nSophie Aldred\nOwen Oakeshott\nColin Guthrie\nProduced by Helen Williams\nBy Dan Freedman &amp; Nick Romero\n\n\nEctoplasm - S01 - E01 - The Curse Of The Mummy's Curse\nEctoplasm - S01 - E02 - The Case Of The Missing Lost Soul\nEctoplasm - S01 - E03 - The Affair Of The Baddie's Niece\nEctoplasm - S01 - E04 - The Adventure Of The Stupid Ignorant Americans\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 54s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n[b]A number of people are posting my torrents on other trackers.\nI have no problem with that - (Not much need as I already do this) - But a name check would be nice\nI was the one who spent weeks,months,years recording them[/b]\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b277a6ffc99b7f03f7733dae77c712e4e4032d9d","amp;dn":"Ectoplasm+-+S01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b277a6ffc99b7f03f7733dae77c712e4e4032d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,119,166,255,201,155,127,3,247,115,61,174,119,199,18,228,228,3,45,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
