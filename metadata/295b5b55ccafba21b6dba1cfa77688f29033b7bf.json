The -400 series is the best selling model in the 747 family.The 747-400 is to be superseded by the Boeing 747-8 as the latest commercial model, which is scheduled to begin deliveries in 2010. The last 747-400 was delivered in December 2009. \n\nThe 747-400 was announced by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in October 1985. Compared to the 747-300 the 747-400 has 6 feet (1.8 m) wing tip extensions, 6 feet (1.8 m) winglets, and a glass cockpit, which dispensed with the need for a flight engineer. The 747-400 also improved on the -300 with an additional fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, engines with improved fuel efficiency and higher thrust, an all-new interior, revised fuselage/wing fairings and newer in-flight entertainment. Like the 747-300, the passenger version of the 747-400 has the stretched upper deck (SUD) as a standard feature. The SUD is almost twice as long as the original 747 upper deck. The SUD was previously offered as a retrofit and first appeared on two Japanese 747-100 SR models.[6] While the wingspan was increased, the overall weight of the wings was decreased due to the use of composites and aluminum alloys. \n\nThe first 747-400 was rolled out in January 1988 and flew for the first time on 29 April 1988. Certification was received on 10 January 1989 with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines, 18 May 1989 with General Electric CF6-80C2s and 8 June 1989 with Rolls-Royce RB211-524Gs. The first 747-400 was delivered to Northwest Airlines on 26 January 1989, with service entry on 9 February.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilt with technical input from Boeing and using the latest modeling techniques for FSX, the PMDG 747-400X -8i/F Product Model Extension adds the majestic new Boeing 747-8 variant to your existing PMDG 747-400X installation. \n\nThis high definition visual model raises the bar on large airliner modeling by showing the 747-8i and 747-8F in exquisite detail. Transparent cabin windows, fully detailed flight controls, 3D engine cores, scalloped nacelles and the incredible 747-8 wing flex are all presented in vivid detail. The model is covered with high definition textures, giving an incredibly lifelike appearance to the model, right down to the finest details. \n\nThe PMDG 747-400X -8i/F Product Model Extension will also please your ears, as we have included a new GEnx based engine sound set so that you can experience the amazing audio experience of the new GEnx engines mounted under-wing. \n\nThe 747-8 is longer than the traditional 747-400, making for a careful challenge as you navigate standard taxiways at the world's airports. Experience the thrill of conducting 90 degree turns while ensuring that you keep the rubber on the pavement! \n\nThe PMDG 747-400X -8i/F Product Model Extension includes both the 747-8 Intercontinental and the 747-8F cargo variants of the aircraft. As usual, dozens of free airline liveries are available from the DOWNLOADS page here at PMDG. \n\n*Note: This product is a visual model extension that uses the underlying PMDG 747-400X simulation for the flight, cockpit and systems models. This product is not intended to simulate the difference in flight characteristics between the 747-400 and the 747-8. This product allows the user to add a high fidelity visual model of the 747-8 to their Flight Simulator X experience.\n\nENJOY!!\n\n\n\n\nTHE TUTORIAL IS COPYRIGHT (C) 2010 OF MAJOR WALES, AND ANY USE OF THIS TUTORIAL MAY RESULT IN PERMANENT DELETION OF THIS TORRENT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS TORRENT DOESN'T NEED ANY MOVING OF FILES (NO &quot;CRACKING&quot; USED!!)\n\nONLY USES LEGIT KEY AND NOTHING ELSE!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------\n|NOTE:                 |\n|                      |\n|NEED TO DOWNLOAD:     |\n|                      |\n|ENABLE BUTTONS.EXE!!  |\n------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295b5b55ccafba21b6dba1cfa77688f29033b7bf","amp;dn":"PMDG+747-400X+%2B+-8i+Installation+guide+%28BOXED+VERSION%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295b5b55ccafba21b6dba1cfa77688f29033b7bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,91,91,85,204,175,186,33,182,219,161,207,167,118,136,242,144,51,183,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
