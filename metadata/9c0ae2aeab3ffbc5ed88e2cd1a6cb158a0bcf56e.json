The author is Blitzer, and it is from the 5th edition.  \n\nThese are the solutions to all chapter test questions in the textbook.  \n\nIf you have a stupid professor who doesn't know how to teach, like me, then these will be very helpful for you. \n\nPlease keep this torrent going by seeding when you are done, or whenever there are peers connected. \n\nIf you would like more instructions, www.coolmath.com helped me.
