The album sparked a brief return to success for the band, including the hit track &quot;Give It Up&quot; which became a radio staple in Britain, but failed to make an impact in the United States, until it would be re-released on KC's next album.\n\nKC and the Sunshine Band is an American musical group. Founded in 1973 in Miami, Florida, their style has included funk, R&amp;B, and disco. Their most well known songs include the disco hits &quot;That's the Way (I Like It)&quot;, &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot;, &quot;I'm Your Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;Keep It Comin' Love&quot;, &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;, &quot;Give It Up&quot;, and &quot;Please Don't Go&quot;. They took their name from lead vocalist Harry Wayne Casey's last name (&quot;KC&quot;) and the &quot;Sunshine Band&quot; from KC's home state of Florida ('The Sunshine State').\n\nWith the release of the self titled triple platinum second album KC and the Sunshine Band in 1975 came the group's first major U.S. hit with &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;. It topped the R&amp;B chart in April and the Billboard Hot 100 in August. &quot;That's the Way (I Like It)&quot; also became a number one hit in November 1975 and the group did well at the 1976 Grammy Awards. The 1976 album Part 3 yielded two number one singles: &quot;I'm Your Boogie Man&quot;, &quot;(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty&quot; and &quot;Keep It Comin' Love&quot; peaked at number two. Their success lasted until the fifth album; their last chart topping hit was &quot;Please Don't Go&quot; in December 1979, hitting #1 for one week in January 1980, and becoming the first #1 hit of the 1980s. With the explosion of new wave music and the declining popularity of disco, the group explored other styles and changed labels, joining Epic Records in 1980 after TK Records went bankrupt.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;festival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_a_Night%27s_Work&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_in_a_Night%27s_Work&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faeCJAaDJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faeCJAaDJ&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:50\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
