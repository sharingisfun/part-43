The amateur videotape was compiled in October 1993, as a gift for Kurt Cobain. It would soon become frequent viewing material on the Nirvana tour bus, and later on the Foo Fighters tour bus as well. Later, after generated copies began circulating amongst fans, the band began selling copies at shows. The tape is only available in VHS format. The band is planning to release a DVD version in the future, but they want to digitally re-create the compilation from the original masters and need the proper time and funds to do so.[1]\n\nThe title of the film refers to several short film sketches that feature action figures, dolls and knick-knack toys having adult conversations and performing sexual acts. The shorts sometimes use stop-motion animation. Mingled within the shorts are home videos and concert performances that include many cover songs played in a joking and spontaneous manner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad83a9fd7947c268ee0fef6208b922b387cb7942","amp;dn":"Frogs+-+Toy+Porno","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad83a9fd7947c268ee0fef6208b922b387cb7942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,131,169,253,121,71,194,104,238,15,239,98,8,185,34,179,135,203,121,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
