Combat and damage mechanics are extremely detailed. Everything is simulated in game if possible. There are no abitrary \\&quot;to hit chance\\&quot; values in Battleships Forever. The game also features many innovative mechanics that you\\'ve never seen before. For example, the Cronus Battleship sports a Flux Shield generator that allows you to draw a defensive force shield around your ships in any shape you want. Another example are the Deflector modules that are used extensively through the game. These modules make a single section of a ship totally invulnerable to fire. This means that you will have to manoeuvre your ships to attack sections of the enemy ships not protected by Deflectors while keeping your own protected sections facing the enemy. Position is paramount!\n\nPlayers will command picked fleets made up of Battleships, Destroyers and Patrol Craft. The completed game will include ten campaign missions and multiple skirmish modes.\n\nBattleships Forever is inspired by and loosely based on Warning Forever by Hikoza.T.Ohkubo\n#+_+===============================================================================\nFurthermore:\n\nProject Status\nBETA TESTING/DEVELOPMENT (Tech and Engine)\n\nTitle: Battleships Forever\nGenre/Category: Tactical Real Time Strategy\nFile Size: ~11mb\nGame File-Type: Zipped\nChange Resolution: Yes(Can be changed in options or with alt-enter)\nFull Screen: Yes(Can be changed in options or with alt-enter)\nGame Resolution: 1024x768\n\nRecommended System Requirements\nWin98 or later\n128mb Graphics Card\n512mb of RAM\nIntel Pentium 2ghz and equivalent\n\nMinimum System Requirements (No surfaces mode)\nWin98 or later\n64mb Graphics Card\n256mb of RAM\nIntel Pentium 1.5ghz and equivalent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688d458de67fa8ff3031ac6b382ed4662e70df91","amp;dn":"Battleships+forever","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688d458de67fa8ff3031ac6b382ed4662e70df91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,141,69,141,230,127,168,255,48,49,172,107,56,46,212,102,46,112,223,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
