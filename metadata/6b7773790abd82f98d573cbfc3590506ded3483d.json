Does the           \n         creature exist? And if it does where is it? And how can it    \n         survive without being detected? Using a new interactive       \n         map the team has plotted more than 10,000 Bigfoot type        \n         sightings from around the world. These sightings are of       \n         an unidentified creature which walks on two legs and is       \n         covered in a thick layer of hair. Many of theses sightings    \n         date back over 100 years. With their expert knowledge         \n         of the natural world they are able to dismiss nearly 90%      \n         of the sightings, but what emerges is a series of global      \n         hotspots that cannot be explained which indicate that         \n         something is out there. The team examines these global        \n         hotspots and searches for explanations including new          \n         theories that suggest we may have been looking for the        \n          wrong creature all along?                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n         Release  Notes    \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                          ORENJI, 2HD, DHD, CTU                        \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
