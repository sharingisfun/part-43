If you use it correctly, and in combination with \nother programs such as data backup utilities, it will significantly reduce the risk of your\ncomputer being attacked or infected by a virus, and thus the risk of losing important or \nprivate data.\nThe Avast! Internet Security application comes with an antispam filter and built-in firewall.\nOnce installed, avast! runs silently in the background to protect your computer against all \nknown forms of malware. You don't need to do anything else - just install and forget! Active\ninternet users need greater protection for themselves as they shop and bank on-line. To secure\nagainst threats from infected web sites and the growing risk of identity theft, avast Internet\nsecurity provides you with continuous protection from its layers of antivirus, anti-spyware, \nanti-rootkit protection, firewall and antispam.\n\nReal-time shields. The real-time shields are the most important part of the program, as they are\nworking continuously to prevent your computer from becoming infected. They monitor all your \ncomputer's activity, checking all programs and files in real-time - i.e. at the moment a program\nis started or whenever a file is opened or closed.\n\nVirus Chest. The virus chest can be thought of as a folder on your hard disk with special properties,\nthat make it a safe, isolated place for storing potentially harmful files. You can work with the \nfiles in the virus chest, with some security restrictions.\n\navast! antispam filter. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated antispam filter to detect\nunwanted email.\nSpam delivered to your mailbox can result in your mailbox quickly becoming full, as a result which, \nlegitimate emails may not be received. It can also unnecessarily increase the load on the email server,\ninternet connection, local networks etc.\n\nFirewall. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated firewall which can be controlled directly\nfrom the avast! user interface.\nThe firewall monitors all communication between your computer and the outside world and blocks unauthorized \ncommunication based on a number of &quot;allow&quot; and &quot;deny&quot; rules. In this way, the firewall can prevent sensitive\ndata from leaving your computer and can also block attempted intrusions by external hackers\n\nCommand-line scanner. The ashCmd program uses the same avast! scanning engine to detect potential malware \ninfections so the results are exactly the same as running a scan via the normal program interface. The avast!\ncommand-line scanner, ashCmd.exe, is normally installed in the directory C:Program FilesAlwil Softwareavast5.\nA scan is run from the command prompt using various switches and parameters. To see a description of the \nparameters, locate the ashCmd file and double click on it. This will open a new window in which the various\nparameters are displayed.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Continuous protection against viruses and spyware\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Ensures all mails sent and received are clean\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keeps you protected from &quot;chat&quot; infections\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stops attacks from hijacked websites\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lets you safely browse suspicious websites or run unknown applications\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Blocks hacker attacks to protect your identity\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Keeps your mailbox free from spam\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Allows safe and uninterrupted gaming\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compatible with Windows XP, Vista and 7\n\nKey Technologies:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved Antivirus and anti-spyware engine\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New avast!
