The album entered (and peaked) in the UK Albums Chart at #5 in late 2005. The album peaked at #9 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart in mid-2005. It was not released in USA. The reason being was because executives at Atlantic Records were not sure if the album was right material for America [1]. Ultimately, in 2007, the album was released digitally and as an import in American record stores.\n\nWorldwide, the album has sold around 2,000,000 copies.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] All The Way\n[02] Don't Love You No More (I'm Sorry)\n[03] Hypnotic\n[04] Separate Ways\n[05] Johnny\n[06] Do You Believe In Love\n[07] One Last Dance\n[08] Unbelievable\n[09] Just Chillin'\n[10] Thief In The Night\n[11] Take 'Em Off\n[12] My Love Don't Stop\n[13] Let Her Go\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:53m:02s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 132mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type    \t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- R&amp;B\n\nOriginal CD Rip    \t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader  \t- Yes - only1joe \n\nOriginally Released\t- 22 August 2005\n\nRecord Company     \t- Teacup Warner\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.craigdavid.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.bebo.com/craigdavid \n\t\t\t- http://twitter.com/craigdavid \n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/craigdavid \n\t\t\t-\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d2640469b8014875358c47952e54f42aca7738","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+The+Story+Goes+-+Craig+David+-+132mb+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d2640469b8014875358c47952e54f42aca7738","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,210,100,4,105,184,1,72,117,53,140,71,149,46,84,244,42,202,119,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
