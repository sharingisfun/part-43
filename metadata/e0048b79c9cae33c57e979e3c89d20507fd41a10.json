She also appears in person at the end of the film, in a botched abduction attempt by Borat for cultural &quot;marriage&quot;\n\n\nplot\n\nBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)\n\nBorat Sagdiyev is a TV reporter of a popular show in Kazakhstan as Kazakhstan's sixth most famous man and a leading journalist.
