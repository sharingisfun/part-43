It was recently released as a motion picture directed by Jonathan Mostow and starring Bruce Willis.\n\nThe year is 2054, and life is reduced to a data feed. The fusing of virtual reality and cybernetics has ushered in the era of the personal surrogate, android substitutes that let users interact with the world without ever leaving their homes. It's a perfect world, and it's up to Detectives Harvey Greer and Pete Ford of the Metro Police Department to keep it that way. But to do so theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll need to stop a techno-terrorist bent on returning society to a time when people lived their lives instead of merely experiencing them. \n\nThe Surrogates is a story about progress and whether there exists a tipping point at which technological advancement will stop enhancing and start hindering our lives. It is also a commentary on identity, the Western obsession with physical appearance, and the growing trend to use science as a means of providing consumers with beauty on demand. \n\nVenditti was inspired to write The Surrogates after reading about numerous individuals who lost their spouses or their jobs due to their addiction to the internet and their online personas. In an interview, he says: &quot;It dawned on me that if you were somehow able to create a persona and send it out into the real world-where it could go to work for you, and run your errands, and so on-then you would never have to go back to being yourself.&quot;\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc5c1a32ac303266961432f2f36c17c600ea3fd","amp;dn":"The+Surrogates","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc5c1a32ac303266961432f2f36c17c600ea3fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,197,193,163,42,195,3,38,105,97,67,47,47,54,193,124,96,14,163,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
