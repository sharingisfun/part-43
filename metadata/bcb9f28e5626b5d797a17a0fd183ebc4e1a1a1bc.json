Trendle. James Reid (Tom Wilkinson) single-handedly built a media empire, but unfortunately his industrious genes werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t passed down to his son, Britt (Seth Rogen). Irresponsible, slovenly, and frequently inebriated, Britt is shaken out of his drunken stupor upon receiving word that his father has died. Shortly after Britt learns that he has inherited the family business, he forges an unlikely alliance with Kato (Jay Chou), one of his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s star employees, and together the pair hatch a plan to pose as villains in order to get close to the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most high-powered criminals. Outfitting their indestructible custom-made car, The Black Beauty, with the absolute latest in technology and high-tech weaponry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and arming themselves to the teeth with an array of gadgets that would make Batman blush ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the masked duo hit the streets as The Green Hornet and Kato. As the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fascination with the mysterious crime fighters hits an all-time high, BrittÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resourceful secretary, Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz), helps them to gather intelligence on notorious underworld kingpin Benjamin Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz), a criminal who holds the entire city in the palm of his hand, and represents everything that BrittÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father fought against. Little do the Green Hornet and Kato realize that Chudnofsky is already on to them, and that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not about to go down without a fight. Rogen and frequent writing partner Evan Goldberg provide the screenplay, with visionary Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) handling directing duties. \n\n\nCast:\nSeth Rogen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Britt Reid / The Green Hornet\nJay Chou ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Kato\nCameron Diaz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Lenore Case\nTom Wilkinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ James Reid\nChristoph Waltz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Benjamin Chudnofsky / Bloodnofsky\nDavid Harbour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ D.A.
