It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong.&quot; According to Draiman, the song also signifies Disturbed's lingering presence and success in the music industry. Draiman comments that the song &quot;kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking here, that we haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time.&quot; Guitarist Dan Donegan furthers this point, stating &quot;We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it.&quot; Draiman concludes, &quot;We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing.&quot;\n\n********************************\nMusic video\n********************************\n\nA music video went into production in June 2008 with Noble Jones as the director, and was unveiled on August 20, 2008. It features high-concept battle scenes, reminiscent of the films 300 and 10,000 BC, intercut with footage of the band performing the song. The video shows the progression of war throughout history; from basic fighting with spears, and arrows, to using modern weaponry such as firearms.\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED ONCE YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89f79b626e82e210fc4c40b8f37104ef01d070a8","amp;dn":"Disturbed+-+Indestructible+Music+Video+720p+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89f79b626e82e210fc4c40b8f37104ef01d070a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,247,155,98,110,130,226,16,252,76,64,184,243,113,4,239,1,208,112,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
