Having been robbed of a year's worth of skins by marauding Indians, Jed Cooper (Mature), Gus Hideout (James Whitmore), and Mungo (Pat Hogan) sign on at a nearby fort. Jed, however, falls in love with Corinna (Anne Bancroft), the refined wife of the commanding officer, Colonel Marston (Robert Preston), and when the latter begins to plan an all-out attack on an unruly Indian tribe, he attempts to prevent what, in all likelihood, will be a mass slaughter. Based on a novel by Richard Emery Roberts, The Last Frontier was re-released to television as Savage Wilderness and came complete with a rousing title song performed by Rusty Draper.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d995a2caba47e4f85dcbde5a4c635c11dd25536","amp;dn":"The+Last+Frontier%2C+Anthony+Mann%2C+1955","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d995a2caba47e4f85dcbde5a4c635c11dd25536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,153,90,44,171,164,126,79,133,220,189,229,164,198,53,193,29,210,85,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
