Seemingly, band animosity was at a high-point by now but you'd never know it because it's another polished live show. The only possible gripe being that it sounds like no-one bothered to turn up. Lack of crowd noise is no bad thing, though, because between tracks Fish is more than keen to get his political point across in typically gruff brogue, giving particular attention to the Northern Ireland's conflict on the classic 'Forgotten Sons'.\n\nTracklist:\nDisc 1:\n01.
