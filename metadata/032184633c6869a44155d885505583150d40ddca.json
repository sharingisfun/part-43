At the same time, he also continues the primarily electric sound of that record. As far as his selection of material goes, Borderline may sometimes lack the surprising, esoteric charm of his earlier recordings, but there are still some terrific finds, including the Tex-Mex-flavored &quot;The Girls from Texas,&quot; which may be the album's finest moment. Other highlights include one of John Hiatt's best, the written-to-order &quot;The Way We Make a Broken Heart,&quot; as well as Billy &quot;The Kid&quot; Emerson's &quot;Crazy 'Bout an Automobile,&quot; which Cooder had been performing live for a number of years, and the soulful Maurice &amp; Mac treasure &quot;Why Don't You Try Me.&quot; And while it's moments like these that help make Cooder's records special, he also takes on some better-known '50s and '60s offerings with moderate success. His recording of Wilson Pickett's 1966 hit &quot;634-5789&quot; isn't going to make anyone forget the original, but he's able to pull it off as a rocker, while &quot;Speedo&quot; and &quot;Down in the Boondocks&quot; are respectable covers. Borderline may not have the singular personality of his best '70s work, but it's a solid outing nonetheless.\n\nRecorded at Warner Bros.
