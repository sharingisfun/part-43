In 2006 Josh Ritter was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest Living Songwriters&quot; by Paste magazine. Ritter has an Americana musical style and has often been compared to Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and Leonard Cohen.\n\n\nSo Runs the World Away is the sixth full-length album by American singer-songwriter Josh Ritter. It was released on vinyl record on April 17th, 2010 as a part of Record Store Day in the United States. The vinyl record came packaged with a CD version of the album as well. The official album release will be April 23, 2010 in Ireland and May 4, 2010 worldwide. Ritter said of the album that it &quot;marks the beginning of a new period in [his] life,&quot; and that overall, &quot;the songs are larger and more detailed, and feel to me as if they were painted in oil on large canvasses.&quot;\n\nThe record's release was met with high anticipation and covered by multiple news and media publications. Stephen King reported looking forward to the album. Bob Boilen of NPR's All Songs Considered said of the album, &quot;I've come to expect good records from him...but this one took my breath away.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Ritter&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Ritter&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the Yet Unknowing World is a limited-edition EP album by Josh Ritter and The Royal City Band, released on February 8, 2011.\n\nThe EP features b-sides, demos, and remixes from the So Runs the World Away recording sessions. To the Yet Unknowing World was first made available on Ritter's official website and at his 2011 tour performances. The EP later went on sale at indie record stores and iTunes, February 15, 2011. The title is from a line in the fifth act of Shakespeare's Hamlet (the title of So Runs the World Away was also from a line of Hamlet, however, from the third act).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Yet_Unknowing_World_%28EP%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Yet_Unknowing_World_%28EP%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
