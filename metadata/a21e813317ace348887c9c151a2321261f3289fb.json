Its initial writer was Sean McKeever. Each issue of Spider-Man Family contained brand new stories featuring Spider-Man and his supporting cast, reprints of classic Spider-Man tales, and an American translation of the original Japanese manga, Spider-Man J.\n\nIn June 2008, Spider-Man Family was rebranded as Amazing Spider-Man Family, and became a showcase title for many of the divergent timelines that had clustered the franchise. In addition to strips set in the Brand New Day timeline, a strip exploring the early days of Peter Parker's life as Spider-Man was also included. Another feature, Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man, written by Tom DeFalco, took place within Marvel's MC2 continuity. \n\nIn November 2008, Joe Quesada confirmed on his blog that cult favourite Spider-Girl would be moving to Amazing Spider-Man Family in April 2009. \n\nOn July 13, 2009, Marvel announced a new monthly anthology title, Web of Spider-Man, to replace Amazing Spider-Man Family. Unlike Amazing Spider-Man Family, it will contain only new stories featuring Spider-Man with the only backup being Spider-Girl.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21e813317ace348887c9c151a2321261f3289fb","amp;dn":"Amazing+Spider-Man+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21e813317ace348887c9c151a2321261f3289fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,30,129,51,23,172,227,72,136,124,156,21,26,35,33,38,31,50,137,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
