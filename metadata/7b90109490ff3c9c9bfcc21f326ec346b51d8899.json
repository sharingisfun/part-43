Adam, sixty something, a                 \n    former swimming champion, is pool attendant            \n    at a smart N'Djamena hotel. When the hotel             \n        gets taken over by new Chinese owners, he is           \n        forced to give up his job to his son Abdel.            \n        Terribly resentful, he feels socially                  \n    humiliated. The country is in the throes of               \n    a civil war. Rebel forces are attacking the                \n    government. The authorities demand that the                \n    population contribute to the &quot;war effort&quot;,             \n        giving money or volunteers old enough to               \n        fight off the assailants. The District Chief           \n        constantly harasses Adam for his                       \n    contribution.
