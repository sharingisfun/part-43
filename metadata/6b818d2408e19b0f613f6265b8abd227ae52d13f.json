A concise yet thorough overview of the languageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s syntax and features is presented, followed by an introduction to Tango, the popular generalÃ¢â‚¬â€œpurpose library youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find invaluable when building your D applications.\n\nby Kris Bell, Lars Ivar Igesund, Sean Kelly, Michael Parker | ISBN-13: 978-1-59059-960-0 | Published Feb 2008 | 208pp.\n\nThe D programming language is a strongly typed, natively compiled computer\nlanguage. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re familiar with C, C++, or Java, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re very\nmuch at home with D, as it retains most of the constructs with which many\nprogrammers are already comfortable. At the same time, D is different in ways\nboth subtle and striking, successfully combining a number of programming styles\nwhile managing to retain a succinct and reasonably simple grammar.\n\nD is designed as a systems language, although it is suitable for a wide range\nof projects, from small programs developed by one person to large-scale,\ncommercial applications worked on by dozens of developers.\n\nTango is a general-purpose companion library that provides a rich variety of\npractical functionality. The Tango library is open source software, with a\nstrong following and an increasingly large number of compatible add-ons\navailable.  TangoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s design is intended to satisfy a desire for both efficiency\nand flexibility, mirroring two principal attributes of D itself. The\napplication programming interface (API) offers many services you would expect\nto find in a modern software development toolkit, such as containers,\ncompression algorithms, threads, fibers, networking, and text manipulation.\n\nThis book, Learn to Tango with D, is an introduction to both the D language and\nthe Tango library. The key features of both are presented in a condensed and\nfast-paced format, where the goal is to give you sufficient information to\nbecome productive quickly and effectively.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.digitalmars.com/d/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.digitalmars.com/d/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b818d2408e19b0f613f6265b8abd227ae52d13f","amp;dn":"%28D+Programming%29++Tango+with+D+-+Apress+-+Digital+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b818d2408e19b0f613f6265b8abd227ae52d13f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,129,141,36,8,225,155,15,97,63,98,101,184,171,210,39,174,82,209,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
