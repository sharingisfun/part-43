Tango mini-series published by DC - Vertigo comics.\n\nHere's the setup:\n\n&quot;Vincente Ponticello isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just a guy who dances the tango in San Francisco, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite possibly one of the best people to dance the tango in San Francisco. What heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not telling anyone, though, is that before he moved out west, he was involved in some less than legal activities and a bit of a gangsterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and now heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in hiding from his old New York associates, making sure to never go back east. Then Autumn shows up, the girl who got away, and sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s desperate for him to recover some pictures that are being used for blackmail. But even on the other side of the country, VincenteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about to learn that you can never really go home again.&quot;\nGreg McElhatton - readaboutcomics.com\n\n\nAll thanks go to the scanners and the original sources who as always wish to remain nameless.\n\n\nPlease seed.
