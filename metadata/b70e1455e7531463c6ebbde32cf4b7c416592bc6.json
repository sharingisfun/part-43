These tracks have never appeared on any other (legitimate) release and so this 7 counts as one of the most prized possessions in any Rush fans' collection. The single was not a great success, and is certainly not the finest Rush recording, but provides a good insight into the formative stages of their career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b70e1455e7531463c6ebbde32cf4b7c416592bc6","amp;dn":"Rush+1973+First+Single+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b70e1455e7531463c6ebbde32cf4b7c416592bc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,14,20,85,231,83,20,99,198,235,189,227,44,244,183,196,22,89,43,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
