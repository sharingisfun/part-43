The Allstars supply molasses-smooth grooves for Clinton to croon over, which he does very well on tracks like &quot;Underground Angel,&quot; the title track and &quot;Fly Away.&quot;\n\nThere are also moments where this is an out-and-out party starter. &quot;If Anybody Gets Funked Up (It's Gonna Be You)&quot; kicks off the album in grand fashion with a nice groove, and the capper is a remix of the same song by P-Funk associate Colin Wolfe.\n\nBut there are those songs that lapse into a boring cadence and stay there. Tracks like &quot;Flatman &amp; Bobbin&quot; and &quot;Mathematics&quot; are prime examples of filler rather than meat.\n\n&quot;T.A.P.O.A.F.O.M.&quot; is hit-or-miss a good portion of the time. There's nothing on here that is really truly BAD, but there are a few selections that are definitely less than good. All in all, however, this is a good record, and if you're a P-Funk fan, this is most definitely your LP. \n\nTrack listing:\n1. If Anybody Gets Funked Up(It's Gonna Be You)\t\n2. Summer Swim\n3. Funky Kind (Gonna Knock It Down)\n4. Mathematics\t\n5. Hard As Steel\n6. New Spaceship\n7. Underground Angel\n8. Let's Get Funky\n9. Flatman &amp; Bobbin\n10.
