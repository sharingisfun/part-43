Since Albania was a part of the dowry of Luis' wife, it seemed like a reasonable idea at the time.

The protagonists talk incessantly, and by the time they get down to the final grand battle, it turns out to be a skirmish between several dozen men.\n\nSorry but I coldn't found subtitles for this movie. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085357/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085357/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36822dfeeab5529f6cb4b47ab828caf69fcf2aeb","amp;dn":"La+Conquista+de+Albania%2FAlbaniaren+konkista%2FThe+Conquest+of+Alba","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36822dfeeab5529f6cb4b47ab828caf69fcf2aeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,130,45,254,234,181,82,159,108,180,180,122,184,40,202,246,159,207,42,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
