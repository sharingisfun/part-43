At 18, Knox moved to Boston to pursue his music career, landing support slots for Art Garfunkel, Pete Francis (of Dispatch), and Tyrone Wells. While there he created his first EP, 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Buckled Knees; its award-winning track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNever Letting GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was featured in MTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s College Life.\n\nNow a New Yorker, Knox derives inspiration from the city that never sleeps for his debut album The Matador &amp; the Acrobat, voted one of Shred NewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTop Ten Albums of 2009.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The city has had a major effect on his writing style: Armed only with a pen and notebook, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ride the subway for hours, observing this new, rich, frenetic underground worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or as one Matador track describes it, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBelly of the Beast.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The resulting visionary melodies, hooks, and intricate arrangements create a stunning world where the songs may hold shadow and darkness, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always light at the end of the tunnel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dadb2fe0377a8d4aa0b0c406db0831e7293e5459","amp;dn":"Will+Knox+-+The+Matador+And+The+Acrobat+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dadb2fe0377a8d4aa0b0c406db0831e7293e5459","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,219,47,224,55,122,141,74,160,176,196,6,219,8,49,231,41,62,84,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
