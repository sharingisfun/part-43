She has been noted for her ethereal visual style and symbolic lyrics. In the early 1980s, and after a hugely successful first solo album, Rolling Stone deemed her &quot;The Reigning Queen of Rock and Roll&quot;.\n\nTrouble in Shangri-La is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter and Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks. Released in 2001, it was her first new solo album since 1994's Street Angel. The album returned Nicks to the top 5 for the first time since 1983's The Wild Heart, and achieved Gold status within six weeks of its release for sales of over 500,000 copies in the U.S. As of May 2008, the album has sold 660,000 copies in the US.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0371d4397c03f18d6d334c6e15037883321c7695","amp;dn":"Stevie+Nicks+-+Trouble+in+Shangri-La+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0371d4397c03f18d6d334c6e15037883321c7695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,113,212,57,124,3,241,141,109,51,76,110,21,3,120,131,50,28,118,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
