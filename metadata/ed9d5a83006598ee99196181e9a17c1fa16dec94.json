It was written by Michael Hutchence and Andrew Farriss, and produced by Nile Rodgers.\n\nIt was released as a single in the U.S. in December 1983, where it reached No. 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. In Australia, it reached No. 1 in 1984, and became an international hit during that year.\n\nSinger Daryl Hall sings the chorus along with Hutchence. According to an interview done in Australia, Hall says Nile Rodgers called him up and asked him to sing on the song. Rodgers had produced the song &quot;Adult Education&quot; for Hall and Oates the previous year.\n\nINXS (pronounced &quot;in excess&quot;) is an Australian rock and New Wave band, formed as The Farriss Brothers in 1977 in Sydney. Mainstays are Garry Gary Beers on bass, Andrew Farriss on keyboards, Jon Farriss on drums, Tim Farriss on lead guitar and Kirk Pengilly on guitar/sax. For twenty years they were fronted by Michael Hutchence on lead vocals, whose &quot;sultry good looks&quot; and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band. Initially known for their New Wave/ska/pop style, they later developed a harder pub rock style, including funk and dance elements.\n\nINXS has won six Australian Recording Industry Association awards including three for 'Best Group' in 1987, 1989 and 1992, and was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2001. To date INXS have sold more than 30 million records.\n(video has a semi-transparent white &quot;festival&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Sin_(INXS_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Sin_(INXS_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/daehcaadj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/daehcaadj&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9640kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:37\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
