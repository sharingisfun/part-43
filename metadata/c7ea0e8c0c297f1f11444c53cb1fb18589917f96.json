That's why his books are the choice of millions worldwide. Now you, too, can quickly master C++ using his proven method. In this fully updated new edition, Herb explains the C++ language, from its fundamentals to its most advanced features. You'll start with an overview of C++ and the general form of a C++ program.\n\nYou'll then learn essentials such as control statements, operators, variables, classes, and objects. Then it's on to exceptions, templates, namespaces, run-time type ID, and the Standard Template Library (STL). There is even a synopsis of the extended keywords used for .NET programming--all presented in Herb's clear, crisp, uncompromising style.\n\nYou will learn about:\n\n     * The general form of a C++ program\n     * Data types, operators, and expressions\n     * Control statements\n     * Functions\n     * Pointers and references\n     * Classes and objects\n     * Function and operator overloading\n     * Constructors and destructors\n     * Templates\n     * Exception handling\n     * Inheritance\n     * Virtual functions\n     * The C++ I/O system\n     * Run-time type ID\n     * Namespaces\n     * The Standard Template Library (STL)\n     * Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles\n     * And much, much more! \n\n\n\n##### Notes #####\n\nThis is an eBook version of C++ from The Ground Up, it is fully OCR'ed (meaning all of the text can be copied and searched), the pages have been properly numbered to match those of the print edition and the chapters (and sub-sections) have been bookmarked for easy reference.\n\nI have also included all of the examples in the book, so you will not have to type them all in to see what they do.\n\nThis book is good for programmers and non-programmers alike who want to learn how to code in C++, an object-orientated language. Although knowing some C will certainly help you it is not at all necessary.\n\nPlease seed this as long as possible after downloading as my Internet connection is very slow and I will not be able to seed at very fast speeds.\n\nIf you liked my upload don't forget to say thank you :).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ea0e8c0c297f1f11444c53cb1fb18589917f96","amp;dn":"C%2B%2B+from+the+Ground+Up+%28incl.+examples%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7ea0e8c0c297f1f11444c53cb1fb18589917f96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,234,14,140,12,41,127,31,17,68,76,83,203,31,177,133,137,145,127,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
