June 1808. Southern Spain. The city of Gerona is under siege by the French army, who is desperately trying to gain a hold onto the fort defending the city's harbour, but things do not look good. As all looks as bad as bad can be, things become even worse, for Team Gamma is on its way to change their fate, and alltogether time itself, and this may not be in a good way. Mostly.\n\nEnter Sophia the jewish summoner (there is no god, only Jahwe and us), Shawarina the fashistic necromancer, and Yubeij the ronin (idiot). Hired as a desperate measure to restore the original timestream that got destroyed somehow, they hack and slash their way all through history.\n\nStyle: Splatter-slapstick-comedy-historic fiction.\nAge: 16+\n\nPlease seed!\n\n\nwww.timecrusaders.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485ec3d38a06c0cf800451da1d0232853ff59403","amp;dn":"Time+Crusaders+-+01-+Under+Attack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485ec3d38a06c0cf800451da1d0232853ff59403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,94,195,211,138,6,192,207,128,4,81,218,29,2,50,133,63,245,148,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
