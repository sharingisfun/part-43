But no one has produced a more\nconsistently excellent set of Brahms symphonies than this....\n\nBrahms is my favorite composer, so I've heard lots of recordings of all four\nof these symphonies. In my opinion, Sanderling's Third and Fourth are\nbetter than any other recordings I have heard - and that includes\nSzell, Walter, Abbado, and Kleiber's Fourth - all highly praised. The\nSecond, although it lacks the excitement and vigor of Kertesz or the\ncurrently unavailable Steinberg, is as loving and beautiful as anyone\ncould make it. Only in the First Symphony do I find Sanderling\nuncompetitive with the very best. His performance there just seems a\nbit rough and scrappy for my taste. The sound is as good as you could\nask for. This set is one of the least known true jewels of the entire\ncatalogue. If you love Brahms, then you MUST have it!\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n[Disk 1]\n\n01) Symphony No. 1 in C minor, op. 68 - I.
