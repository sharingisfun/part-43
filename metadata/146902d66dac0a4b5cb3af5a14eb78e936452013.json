And Gervaise, his vivid 1956 adaptation of Emile Zola's 1877 masterpiece L'assommoir, is no exception.\nAn uncompromising depiction of a lowly laundress's struggles to deal with an alcoholic husband while running her own business,\n\nGervaise was nominated for an Oscar, and the indomitable Maria Schell earned best actress honors at the Venice Film Festival. Rene Clement, one of France's leading directors after the post World War 2 era directs an adaptation of Emile Zola's novel, L' Assommoir.\n\nThis French film which won BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best Actor, Francois Perier also was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language film. \n\nClement, known for his originality and inventiveness depicts the fatal degeneration of one woman's family in 1860's France. This depressing and devastating story of one working class woman's efforts to improve herself are doomed by the two alcoholic men in her life. First is her former lover, Lantier, who left her and their two children to live with another woman and secondly her current husband, Coupeau, who takes to alcohol after he falls off a roof and injures himself.\n\nThis film is an excellent view of the lower and working class in 1800's France and has an outstanding cast. Your heart breaks for main character, Gervaise, a crippled laundress, who only wants to be happy and improve her lot. She is played very realistically by Maria Schell. I felt this was very close to being a Greek Tragedy. Not only do the two men in her life break her heart and give her more than she can bear but the person she thinks is her best friend has nothing but revenge on her mind from a former fight they had years earlier. When the only decent man in her life leaves the scene because he thinks Gervaise is involved in some kind of &quot;menage a trios&quot;.\nGervaise loses all hope and spirals downward into depression and the evils of alcoholism herself.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/vlcsnap-2009-09-23-08h42m19s218.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/vlcsnap-2009-09-23-08h42m19s218.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/vlcsnap-2009-09-23-08h44m02s240.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i672.photobucket.com/albums/vv90/tau-tau_the-egyptian-mau/vlcsnap-2009-09-23-08h44m02s240.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----my rip---\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,610,473,472                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:57:08                \n\nFrame Count:....................................168502             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................448                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.357                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1632                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.250&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n\n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
