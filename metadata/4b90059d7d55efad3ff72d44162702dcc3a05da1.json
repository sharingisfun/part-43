Her ex-husband, Fritz Lang directs this routine, outdated drama about an exotic dancer named Seetha (Debra Paget) who is hired by Chandra (Walther Reyer), an Indian maharaja. Chandra is having problems keeping his domain in order and his subjects are on the verge of rebellion. To make matters worse, Seetha is not interested in him but in Harald Berger (Paul Hubschmid), an architect. Harald is there to construct colonial-style architecture, but between the rebellious peasants and the Maharaja, he and Seetha have dim prospects for a future here.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052295/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052295/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1244&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-1244&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\nFritz Lang\n\n\n\n        Debra Paget\t ... \tSeetha\n\tPaul Hubschmid\t... \tHarald Berger / Henri Mercier in French version\n\tWalter Reyer\t... \tChandra\n\tClaus Holm\t... \tDr. Walter Rhode\n\tLuciana Paluzzi\t... \tBaharani\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 00:00:00\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480  4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 0 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,00 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b90059d7d55efad3ff72d44162702dcc3a05da1","amp;dn":"The+Tiger+of+Eschnapur+%281959%29++Fritz+Lang+Eng+%28ext+Greek+subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b90059d7d55efad3ff72d44162702dcc3a05da1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,144,5,157,125,85,239,173,63,247,45,68,22,39,2,220,195,160,93,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
