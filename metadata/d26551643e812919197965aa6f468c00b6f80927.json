If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d26551643e812919197965aa6f468c00b6f80927","amp;dn":"PDFTiger+v1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d26551643e812919197965aa6f468c00b6f80927","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,101,81,100,62,129,41,25,25,121,101,170,111,70,140,0,182,248,9,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
