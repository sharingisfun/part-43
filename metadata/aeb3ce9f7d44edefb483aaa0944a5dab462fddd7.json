The value of this method of selection is its proximity to both the painters' intentions and their patrons' requirements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb3ce9f7d44edefb483aaa0944a5dab462fddd7","amp;dn":"European+Portrait+Painting+1420-1670","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb3ce9f7d44edefb483aaa0944a5dab462fddd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,179,206,159,125,68,237,239,180,131,170,160,148,74,93,171,70,47,221,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
