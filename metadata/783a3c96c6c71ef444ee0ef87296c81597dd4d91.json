While various synth pioneers had come \nbefore -- Gary Numan, early Human League, late-'70s Euro-disco, and above all \nKraftwerk all had clear influence on Speak &amp; Spell -- Depeche became the \nundisputed founder of straight-up synth pop with the album's 11 songs, light, \nhooky, and danceable numbers about love, life, and clubs. For all the claims \nabout &quot;dated&quot; '80s sounds from rock purists, it should be noted that the basic \nguitar/bass/drums lineup of rock is almost 25 years older than the catchy \nkeyboard lines and electronic drums making the music here. That such a sound \nwould eventually become ubiquitous during the Reagan years, spawning lots of \ncrud along the way, means the band should no more be held to blame for that than \nMotown and the Beatles for inspiring lots of bad stuff in the '60s. Credit for \nthe album's success has to go to main songwriter Vince Clarke, who would extend \nand arguably perfect the synth pop formula with Yazoo and Erasure; the classic \nearly singles &quot;New Life,&quot; &quot;Dreaming of Me,&quot; and &quot;Just Can't Get Enough,&quot; along \nwith numbers ranging from the slyly homoerotic &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; to the moody thumper \n&quot;Photographic,&quot; keep everything moving throughout. David Gahan undersings about \nhalf the album, and Martin Gore's two numbers lack the distinctiveness of his \nlater work, but Speak &amp; Spell remains an undiluted joy.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    AN EARVOLUTION REVIEW ON THE REMASTERS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe remaster includes remixed stereo versions of the original recordings, \nadditional songs, 5.1 surround sound and DTS versions on DVD, and a &quot;Behind the \nMusic&quot; style &quot;mini-film.&quot; However, because it was the record that kicked things \noff for the band, I'll focus on Speak and Spell.\n\nDepeche Mode were unique when Speak and Spell was originally released and not \nsimply because they disposed of the guitar, bass, and drum and replaced them \nwith synthesizers. Thier uniqueness stemmed from matching all these sounds with \ntheir finely crafted pop songs. Vince Clarke, Andy Fletcher and Martin Gore \nmanned the synths behind David Gahan's innocent vocals. &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot;, \na Depeche Mode classic and arguably their most recognizable tune on Speak and \nSpell, still has that heart thumping beat. That first record also included \nDepeche Mode classic's &quot;New Life&quot; and &quot;Dreaming of Me.&quot;\n\nClarke's songs range from fluffy dance party song's to extremely dark and \nmenacing. On the remaster they include the not so subtle, but upbeat, tale of \nheartbreak &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot;. The homoerotic &quot;Boys Say Go&quot; and \n&quot;What's Your Name?&quot; are almost laughable after 25 years of debate on the \n&quot;sexuality&quot; of Depeche Mode. The songs hold up as instrumental's, but I can't \nimagine Gahan or Gore even entertaining such light fare. &quot;Puppets&quot; and \n&quot;Photographic&quot; are much more indicative of the template that Gore would adopt in \nfuture Depeche Mode songs. These are the hidden gems of Speak and Spell.\n\nGore's infancy as a song writer is on full display for their first album. The \nforgettable &quot;Big Muff&quot; follows the somber &quot;TORA! TORA! TORA!&quot; - which is solid \nenough for repeat listens and hints ever so slightly at the musician that Gore \nwould become. Gahan's vocals which seemed muffled on the original release gain a \nlittle more strength on the stereo remaster and are completely liberated in the \n5.1 and DTS versions. More than on any other Depeche Mode release Gahan comes \nacross more as a figurehead rather than a front man, especially on the \naforementioned &quot;Boys Say Go&quot; and &quot;What's Your Name?.&quot;\n\nFor pure and casual Depeche Mode fans, the retrospective mini-film Do We Really \nHave to Give Up Our Day Jobs?, makes this remaster worth it's weight. Clarke, \nFletcher, Gore, and Gahan are positively giddy when they remember the genesis of \nDepeche Mode. Clarke, of course, left after Speak and Spell and went on to form \nYazoo (Yaz in America) and later the hugely successful Erasure. Twenty five \nyears has dispelled any acrimony that occurred at the time. Clarke's leaving the \nband is only mentioned in a textual epilogue at the close of the mini-film.\n\nOne of the other highlight's of the mini-film is the interview with Brian \nGriffin who conceptualized the cover photo for Speak and Spell. He owns up to \nthe fact that the cellophane covered swan is a bit over the top and finally \nadmits he has no idea what he prompted him to submit such a horrible cover to \nthe band, though the band seem to give him a pass.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was the only Depeche Mode album with Vince Clarke as a member of the band. \nClarke wrote most of the songs for the band, before departing to form the \nsynthpop duo Yazoo with Alison Moyet and later, the duo Erasure with Andy Bell.\n\nThe album is significantly lighter in tone and melody than their later work, a \ndirection which can largely be attributed to Clarke's writing. After he left, \nMartin Gore would take over songwriting duties, writing almost all of the band's \nmaterial. Later albums written by him would explore darker subjects and \nmelodies.\n\nThe album title alludes to the then-popular &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; electronic toy.\n\nWhen interviewed by Simon Amstell for Channel 4's Popworld programme in 2005, \nMartin Gore and Andrew Fletcher both stated that the track &quot;What's Your Name?&quot; \nwas their least favourite Depeche Mode song of all time.\n\n2006 RE-RELEASE\n\nThe album was re-released on 3 April 2006 (along with Music for the Masses and \nViolator) as part of Mute's extensive Depeche Mode reissue schedule. This \nspecial edition release was a double disc set that included a Hybrid SACD/CD and \na DVD. This format included the album in 5 formats - multi-channel SACD, stereo \nSACD, PCM stereo CD, DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1.\n\nIn the United States, the album was not re-released until June 2, 2006. The US \nversion was only a CD rather than a SACD/CD Hybrid, though it still included the \nDVD which was identical to the European one (barring some different copyrights \nand logos).\n\nThe re-release somewhat preserves the album as it was originally intended. As \nsuch, while it is mostly the same as the British version, North America got a \ncompletely new version with some songs that have never been released there. For \nexample, &quot;New Life&quot; was the original version, not a remix, and &quot;I Sometimes Wish \nI Was Dead&quot; finally debuted in North America. However, &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;, the \nband's very first single which was not on the original album, was put at the \nend. The four bonus tracks on the original CD release in the UK, were left off \nof the re-issued CD, but were on the DVD.\n\nAlso included was a 28 minute documentary about the making of the album entitled \nDepeche Mode: 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1981 (Do We Really Have To Give Up Our Day Jobs?) featuring \ninterviews with the group (including Vince Clarke) and other relevant presonnel \nsuch as Daniel Miller. There is various footage of the group's appearances on \nTop of the Pops including their very first appearance from 1981 performing &quot;New \nLife&quot;. There is also vintage BBC footage of the Speak &amp; Spell Tour from the same \nyear.\n\nThe remastered album was released on &quot;deluxe&quot; vinyl in March 2007.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNEW LIFE     by Stewart Mason\n\nThe opening track from Depeche Mode's debut album, &quot;New Life&quot; does a fine job of \nintroducing the band's early sound, a mixture of Euro- disco beats, Kraftwerk-\ninspired synth textures, and the sort of shameless pop hooks that would largely \ndisappear from the band when primary songwriter Vince Clarke left shortly after \nthis album's release. The song's instantly memorable chorus (not to mention the \nclever evocation of the Beatles' version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; at the end) is an \nearly indicator of Clarke's unapologetic love of catchy tunes and ear-grabbing \ngimmicks, which he would go on to refine in Yazoo and Erasure, but the ultra-\nmodern electronic arrangement, created by the band in association with Mute \nRecords head and experimental composer Daniel Miller, balances Clarke's devotion \nto ABBA with an of-the-moment sonic palette. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDREAMING OF ME     by Stewart Mason\n\nDepeche Mode's first single wasn't a chart success -- in fact, it was such a \nflop that it wasn't included on the U.K. edition of their debut album, Speak &amp; \nSpell, and only made it onto the U.S. version because someone at Sire Records \napparently felt a bit queasy about the song called &quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was \nDead,&quot; which &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; replaced -- but it's a charming slice of synth pop \nthat neatly sets the agenda of the Vince Clarke-led edition of the band. Despite \nthe chilly modernism of the all- electronic production, which producer/solo \nartist/ Mute Records owner Daniel Miller made sure was entirely au courant, \n&quot;Dreaming of Me&quot; is a distinctly catchy pop song, with a twinkling musical hook \nand a winsome chorus that Dave Gahan and Martin Gore sing in an absolutely \nangelic harmony. Remember that in 1980, when this single was released, the \nclosest that the new wave of British electronic music had come to a truly catchy \npop single was perhaps Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's &quot;Enola Gay,&quot; and \nsongs like Miller's own &quot;Warm Leatherette&quot; were much closer to the norm. \n&quot;Dreaming of Me,&quot; though it wasn't a success at the time, was an early harbinger \nto a new rapprochement between what had previously been a defiantly anti-\ncommercial backwater of the post-punk underground and the Top of the Pops. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH     \tby Ned Raggett\n\nLight, breezy, throwaway, and all the better for it, &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; was \nVince Clarke's triumphant moment with Depeche Mode, both putting the band on a \nfirm enough footing to strike out even higher and confirming Clarke's own \nsongwriting genius. If the desire is for synth pop, this is almost certainly it. \nWhile the early '80s saw England gripped with the synth wave, Depeche, with this \nsong, overtly married happy, romantic pop sentiments with clean, crisp \ntechnology like nobody beforehand -- and the amount of those following who used \nthis as a model can't be counted. The true mark of the song's success is that 20 \nyears and a technological revolution on, nothing about the track sounds \nspecifically dated, it's just a great pop song, sung excellently by David Gahan, \nbacked with fine harmonies. The beat is big and sharp without being pummeling, \nits dancefloor appeal immediate and obvious, the sweet synth melodies spiralling \nthroughout the track with the greatest of ease. If Depeche had been a straight-\nup rock band, this would be a &quot; power pop classic,&quot; but the truth is, as \nrecorded, it was the power poppiest of them all, so intrinsically identified \nwith band and era that the group plays it to this day, long after Clarke's \ndeparture. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ (A REQUEST)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's usual to post comments only to complain about a torrent which doesn't work \nin your configuration.  It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:783a3c96c6c71ef444ee0ef87296c81597dd4d91","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Speak+%26+Spell+%285.1+DTS+9624-AC3%29+%5BDVD%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"783a3c96c6c71ef444ee0ef87296c81597dd4d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,58,60,150,198,199,30,244,68,238,14,248,114,150,200,21,151,221,77,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
