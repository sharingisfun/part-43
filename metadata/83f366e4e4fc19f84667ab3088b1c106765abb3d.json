Scott Fitzgerald's story, re-teams the director with Brad Pitt, who takes on the title role. What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness. Cate Blanchett co-stars along with Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 2 Hours 46 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f366e4e4fc19f84667ab3088b1c106765abb3d","amp;dn":"The+Curious+Case+of+Benjamin+Button%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f366e4e4fc19f84667ab3088b1c106765abb3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,243,102,228,228,252,25,248,70,103,171,48,136,177,193,6,118,90,187,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
