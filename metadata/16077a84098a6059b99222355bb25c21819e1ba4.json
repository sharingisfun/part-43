It was Manning who allegedly stole the classified documents \npublished by WikiLeaks. It is Manning who now languishes in a US \nmilitary prison.\n\nNow reporter Quentin McDermott tells the inside story of Bradley \nManning and his daring intelligence heist. David House is one of the \nfew civilians allowed to visit Bradley Manning in jail. He describes the \nyoung soldier's mental deterioration and his struggle to deal with long \nhours of confinement.\n\nHe tells the program: &quot;...the US Government is just trying to put \nimmense pressure on him in order to get him to crack open.&quot;\n\nIn Monday's Four Corners we hear the only recording of Bradley \nManning's voice and we listen to the logs of alleged conversations \nwith the man who ultimately betrayed him.\n\nThat man is Adrian Lamo. In an extraordinary interview he reveals \nhow he came to know Bradley Manning, claiming the young soldier \nopenly confessed to him his role in the WikiLeaks scandal.\n\nFour Corners also explores the disputes that have erupted inside \nWikiLeaks. A former insider has told the program how he held deep \nreservations about Julian Assange's determination to keep releasing \nmaterial that might compromise his source.\n\nThe program puts these accusations to the WikiLeaks boss.\n\nThere is little doubt America wants to punish Julian Assange. But to \nbring a case against him vital questions must be answered: How did \nPrivate Bradley Manning steal the classified material? How did he \nrelay it to WikiLeaks? Did he do this of his own accord or did Julian \nAssange conspire with him to take the information?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2011/s3135595.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2011/s3135595.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
