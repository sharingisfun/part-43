The album was released on 31 March 2008 with the lead single, &quot;Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)&quot;, released in November 2007. The second single, &quot;American Boy&quot; featuring Kanye West reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on downloads alone and was released physically on March 24. The American Boy remixes, and the Album &quot;Shine&quot; were taken from the US iTunes store due to a decision by Atlantic to follow Kid Rock's successful decision to not sell his latest album on iTunes or any digital retailer. It was added back onto the store on 9 September[1]  due to a large drop in sales and &quot;American Boy&quot;'s decline in Billboard rankings. Shine has been certified Gold in the UK, denoting 100,000 copies sold. It features the Grammy-winning Single American Boy.  Shine was one of the twelve nominees for the 2008 Mercury Prize.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Danny McKenna - Award-winning British artist Estelle never got her just desserts for her 2004 debut album The 18th Day. Though the record was a critical success, it failed to make the mainstream splash many had hoped for. Her sophomore project, Shine, seems hell bent on avoiding the same fate. Backed up by a coterie of high profile US starlets--Wyclef Jean, will.i.am, Mark Ronson and Kanye West--Shine has surefire commercial success written all over it; though that's not to say Estelle has sold out. Despite the high-impact American-style production, Shine remains reassuringly British. Estelle's West London twang is as sharp as ever, and even Kanye drops rhymes about &quot;WAGS&quot; and &quot;London Boys&quot; (see single &quot;American Boy&quot;). It's every bit as diverse as its predecessor too, featuring dancehall party jams (&quot;Magnificent&quot;, produced by Mark Ronson and featuring Kardinal Offishall), the will.i.am produced &quot;Wait a Minute (Just a Touch)&quot; (which uses a twisted up sample from Screamin' Jay Hawkins' &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;) to lovers' rock (&quot;Come Over&quot;) and, of course, some love ballads too, such as &quot;Substitute Lover&quot;, overseen by Wyclef. A solid all-round follow up, Shine should give Estelle the commercial success she deserves.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Wait A Minute (Just A Touch)\n[02] No Substitute Love\n[03] American Boy\t---&gt; Featuring Kanye West\n[04] More Than Friends\n[05] Magnificent\t---&gt; Featuring Kardinal Offishall\n[06] Come Over\n[07] So Much Out The Way\n[08] In The Rain\n[09] Back In Love\n[10] You Are\t---&gt; Featuring John Legend\n[11] Pretty Please (Love Me)\t---&gt; Featuring Cee-Lo\n[12] Shine\n\t\nTotal Play Time\t&gt; 00h:47m:30s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 327mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nVideo Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nUploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; R&amp;B Hip Hop Rap\nRelease Date\t&gt; 331 March 2001\nRecord Company\t&gt; Atlantic Recording\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.estellemusic.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_%28singer%29\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/e/estelle.html\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27d7a267405098abd3e0787b7595a50dd26fab6e","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+Shine+-+Estelle+327mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27d7a267405098abd3e0787b7595a50dd26fab6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,215,162,103,64,80,152,171,211,224,120,123,117,149,165,13,210,111,171,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
