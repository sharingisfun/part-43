It's fab for driving, and equally good at parties,\nas long as you're a 30-something plus! The beats per minute aren't \ntoo high, and this will therefore not cause you to rev up to max speed. \n\nBut it does help to pass a long journey, or cheer you up while you're \nstuck in that infernal traffic jam.\n\nThe album has music from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and the 90s, and is a well\nthought-out selection of music. \n\nThere is no 'sameness' about the tracks, so each new track will be a \ngentle surprise to you, and you will sometimes reach for the cover, \nto see who the artist was on a particular track! \nI did, for 'Driver's Seat - Sniff 'n' the Tears. \n\nDid you know that that was a hit in 1979? \nAnyway, lest I get too carried away, a good buy, if you are a \ncompilation-junkie like me, and an album you will come to treasure.\n_____________________________________________________\n\nCD 1\n\n1.
