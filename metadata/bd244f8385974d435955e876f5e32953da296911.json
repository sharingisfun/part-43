This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nI am very proud on sound quality and hence I recommend use of stereo system and proper loudspeakers (connect Line Out of Soundcard or standalones with Line In of any Stereo rack).\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).\nMany of movies I encode have embedded or external  subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd244f8385974d435955e876f5e32953da296911","amp;dn":"Breaking.Bad.S03E06.720p.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd244f8385974d435955e876f5e32953da296911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,36,79,131,133,151,77,67,89,85,232,118,245,227,41,83,218,41,105,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
