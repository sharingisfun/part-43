Humans \nwaited for the hostile attack, or the giant advances in technology. Neither came. Instead, the aliens were \nrefugees, the last survivors of their home world. The creatures were set up in a makeshift home in South \nAfrica's District 9 as the world's nations argued over what to do with them. Now, patience over the alien \nsituation has run out. Control over the aliens has been contracted out to Multi-National United (MNU), a \nprivate company uninterested in the aliens' welfare - they will receive tremendous profits if they can make \nthe aliens' awesome weaponry work. So far, they have failed; activation of the weaponry requires alien DNA. \nThe tension between the aliens and the humans comes to a head when an MNU field operative, Wikus van der \nMerwe (Sharlto Copley), contracts a mysterious virus that begins changing his DNA. Wikus quickly becomes \nthe most hunted man in the world, as well as the most valuable - he is the key to unlocking the secrets of \nalien technology. Ostracized and friendless, there is only one place left for him to hide: District 9.\n\n \nSharlto Copley ... Wikus Van De Merwe\nJason Cope ...
