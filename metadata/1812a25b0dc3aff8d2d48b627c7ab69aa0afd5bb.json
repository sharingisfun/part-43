There are so many great tracks that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible to list them all, but highlights have to be the barnstorming &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot;, the bouncy, floor-filling &quot;Rock DJ&quot; and the song that madeth the man, &quot;Angels&quot;.\n\nIt included two new songs, these being &quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, which were both released as singles.&quot;Radio&quot;, the compilation's first single, was released in October 2004, debuting at number-one of the UK Singles Chart (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit) selling 41,732 copies.
