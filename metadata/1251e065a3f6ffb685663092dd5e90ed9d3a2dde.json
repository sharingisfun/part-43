Anderson (Keanu Reeves) leads a secret life as a hacker under the alias &quot;Neo&quot; and wishes to learn the answer to the question &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;. Cryptic messages appearing on his computer monitor and encounters with three sinister Agents, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), lead him to a group led by the mysterious underground hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man who offers him the chance to learn the truth about the Matrix. Several members of Morpheus' inner circle, including an infamous female hacker called Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), take Neo to a secret meeting, but only after they have exposed and removed a robotic tracking bug implanted in Neo's body by the Agents. Morpheus then offers Neo a choice between two pills: A blue pill that would return him to his old life, and a red pill that would allow him to learn the answers he seeks. Neo swallows the red pill, and he abruptly finds himself in a liquid-filled pod, his body connected by tubes and cables to a vast mechanical tower covered with identical pods. The connections are severed, and he is rescued by Morpheus and taken aboard his ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo's atrophied physical body is restored, and Morpheus explains the situation\n\nIMDB Link:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nKeanu Reeves\nLaurence Fishburne\nCarrie-Anne Moss\nHugo Weaving\nJoe Pantoliano\n\nThe Matrix (1999)\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1224.51 MiB\nDuration: 2h 16mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 256 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-21 05:39:23\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00813787543556810238.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/00813787543556810238.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12451920509062741614.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/12451920509062741614.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline: Neo wakes from a nightmare in which Trinity is shot by an agent of the Matrix while falling from a building. Morpheus receives a message from Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion's hovercraft. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock (Harry J. Lennix), the ranking military officer of Zion, orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught. Morpheus asks a ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle, in defiance of Commander Lock's orders. The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the Caduceus' crew, Bane, encounters Agent Smith, who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then leaves the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body.\n\nIMDB Link:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nThe Matrix Reloaded\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1225.12 MiB\nDuration: 2h 18mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 239 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-21 19:59:52\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40793390153427542942.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/40793390153427542942.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/07763702581147918498.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/07763702581147918498.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nStoryline: The film begins where The Matrix Reloaded ended. Bane and Neo are both unconscious, but Neo shows neural patterns suggesting he is in the Matrix. Morpheus decides to start a search for Neo within the Matrix. Neo finds himself trapped in a subway station; a transition zone between the Matrix and the machine world. At this station, Neo meets a 'family' of programs, including a girl named Sati, whose father tells Neo that the station is controlled by a program called The Trainman, an exile loyal only to the Merovingian who exerts complete control over the subway. When Neo tries to board the train with the family, the Trainman refuses to let him aboard. Seraph contacts Morpheus on behalf of the Oracle. The Oracle, with a changed appearance, informs Morpheus and Trinity of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus, and Trinity pursue the Trainman to secure Neo's release. The trio enters Club Hel to confront the Merovingian to release Neo. The Merovingian demands &quot;the eyes of the Oracle&quot; in exchange for Neo's release. Trinity loses her patience and provokes a Mexican standoff, forcing the Merovingian to release Neo\n\nIMDB Link:    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1224.31 MiB\nDuration: 2h 9mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 324 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-22 13:52:38\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31\nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26324853650068783869.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/26324853650068783869.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27285640710697068731.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/27285640710697068731.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!
