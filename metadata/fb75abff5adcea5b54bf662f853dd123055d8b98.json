Time Team material upto Series 17 (2010), including publications, specials, live broadcasts, and the various spin-off series (but exclude a number of short DVD-only extras and the pilots).\n\nThe files in this torrent have been collated from many different torrent sources, and represent the best versions that I could find, but HD files have been avoided where possible to keep the overall torrent size manageable.  A typical episode lasts ~48 minutes, in either 350Mb  or 700Mb filesize (VHS/TV/DVD mixed quality).  \n\nThis was originally collated as a megapack for a private tracker. I can take no credit for the capping or encoding any of this material: for more information about the source torrents, credits and reasoning behind particular version choices, see the included text file.\n\n__\n\nContents :\n\nTime Team S01 (1994)\nTime Team S02 (1995) + PDF reports\nTime Team S03 (1996) + PDF reports\nTime Team S04 (1997) + PDF reports\nTime Team S05 (1998) + PDF reports\nTime Team S06 (1999) + PDF reports\nTime Team S07 (2000)\nTime Team S08 (2001)\nTime Team S09 (2002)\nTime Team S10 (2003)\nTime Team S11 (2004)\nTime Team S12 (2005)\nTime Team S13 (2006)\nTime Team S14 (2007) + PDF reports\nTime Team S15 (2008)\nTime Team S16 (2009)\nTime Team S17 (2010) \n\nTime Team Specials 01-45\n\nTime Team Live 1997 - Turkdean, Gloucestershire\nTime Team Live 1998 - Bawsey, Norfolk\nTime Team Live 1999 - York\nTime Team Live 2000 - Canterbury, Kent\nTime Team Live 2001 - Braemore, Hampshire\nTime Team Live 2003 - The Big Dig\nTime Team Live 2005 - Big Roman Dig\nTime Team Live 2006 - Big Royal Dig\n\nTime Team America S01 (2009) PBS\nTime Team Digs, A History of Brtain (2002)\nTime Team History Hunters (1998-9)\n\nTrench One Magazine PDF (1998-05)\n\ndata sources.txt\n\n__\n\nThere is probably a significant overlap between the data in this torrent, and the recently posted (but less comprehensive and currently very slow to seed) torrent at https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6206367.  Feel free to selectively use this one to get data faster and help complete the other!
