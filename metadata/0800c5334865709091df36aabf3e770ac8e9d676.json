Soon afterwards, she became a highly visible symbol of Congress' efforts to deny NEA grants to potentially offensive material, as Senator Jesse Helms blasted Finley in 1990 for a piece in which she smeared chocolate over her nude body. When the NEA refused her application for a grant because of the content of her work, she and three other similarly affected artists sued; a federal district court declared the so-called &quot;standards of decency&quot; provision unconstitutional in 1992, a decision upheld four years later by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nHer performance work, all self-authored, was mainly centered around the oppression of women and resultant feelings of rage and self-loathing, but also addressed sexual repression, domestic abuse, homosexuality, and other taboo subjects. It was confrontational, provocative, often scatological, and left no room for neutrality.\n\nSteve Huey, All Music Guide\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0800c5334865709091df36aabf3e770ac8e9d676","amp;dn":"Karen+Finley+-+The+truth+is+hard+to+swallow+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0800c5334865709091df36aabf3e770ac8e9d676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,0,197,51,72,101,112,144,145,223,54,170,191,62,119,10,200,233,214,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
