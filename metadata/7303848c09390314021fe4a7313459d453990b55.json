Yeah? No? OK. That dream is about to come true whether you had it or not.\n\nThe songs on this compilation have mostly been created using original videogame hardware running home-brew software, and vary radically in style, from minimal 'one man and his Game Boy' compositions to 8-bit inspired full band performances. Pterodactyl Squad proudly presents the music of Weezer as you have never heard it before.\n\nCreative Commons - Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0 Unported","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7303848c09390314021fe4a7313459d453990b55","amp;dn":"Weezer+-+The+8-bit+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7303848c09390314021fe4a7313459d453990b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,3,132,140,9,57,3,20,2,31,228,167,49,52,89,212,83,153,11,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
