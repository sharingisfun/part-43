In order to maintain current population, the average woman must have 2.1 children during her lifetime. Essentially, she needs to replace herself and a man. Because some children will die before reaching maturity, slightly more than two children are needed. Hence, 2.1.\n\nA birthrate of more than 2.1 equals population growth. A birthrate of less than 2.1 means long term population decline.  The rate of 2.1 is based on currently low infant mortality rates.  In countries where infant mortality is higher, the birthrate required for population replacement would also be higher.\n\nQuestion: What does the expression ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDemographic WinterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mean?\n\nAnswer:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDemographic WinterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ denotes the worldwide decline in birthrates, also referred to as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbirth-dearth,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and what it portends.\n\nDemographer Philip Longman (author of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Empty Cradle: How Falling Birthrates Threaten World ProsperityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) observes: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe ongoing global decline in human birthrates is the single most powerful force affecting the fate of nations and the future of society in the 21st. century.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWorldwide, birthrates have been halved in the past 50 years. There are now 59 nations, with 44% of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population, with below-replacement fertility\n\nSometime in this century, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s population will begin to decline. At a certain point, the decline will become rapid. We may even reach population free-fall in our lifetimes.\n\nFor some countries, population decline is already a reality. Russia is losing three-quarters-of-a-million people a year. Its population (currently 145 million) is expected to fall by one-third by 2050.\n\nThe term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnuclear winter,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ popularized in the 1980s, alluded to the catastrophic environmental impact of a nuclear war. The long-term consequences of demographic winter could be equally devastating.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b0bfeb035dc5a399369a843f34dcadee5734e85","amp;dn":"Demographic+Winter+-+the+Decline+of+the+Human+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b0bfeb035dc5a399369a843f34dcadee5734e85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,11,254,176,53,220,90,57,147,105,168,67,243,77,202,222,229,115,78,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
