All Add-ons are tested by me personally with RailWorks2 v116.5a an works great! If you\nwant to download RailWorks, I advise you to download the &quot;RailWorks.2-SKIDROW&quot; torrent here on the TPB which is version v114.0b\nand update it with the upgrades in this torrent, that works fine for me. It's possible that the files also works with an older version of RailWorks or even with RailSimulator, but I hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t test that so I can't guarantee anything.\nSome of these Add-ons works also on a legal version of RailWorks, but please note that every time Steam updates RailWorks, the\nAssets that comes with RailWorks will be overwritten, so most of RSDL Add-ons don't work on legal versions! Have fun with it!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to install?\nAt first extract the *.rar file with WinRar or something else, then there are two options:\n-   *.rar file contains a *.rwp file; Install this using the Package Manager in Railworks by pressing &quot;Install&quot; in the &quot;Package\n    Manager&quot; tab and select the extracted *.rwp file, RailWorks will install the Assets now, if ask, overwrite existing Assets.\n-   *.rar file contains &quot;Assets&quot; and/or &quot;Content&quot; and/or some other folders; copy the folders to the main folder of RailWorks\n    for example &quot;C:\\Program Files\\RailSimulator.com\\RailWorks 2&quot;, if ask overwrite existing folders and files.\nNow you can use the installed Add-on in RailWorks, sometimes it's needed that you delete all &quot;Blueprint.pak&quot; files in the \nsubfolders of the &quot;Assets&quot; directory to show up the installed Add-ons!\n\nNote: With some files there is an Readme.txt enclosed, please read that file carefully for installation instructions!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdd-ons that are in the package (sorted on filename), for some Class xx locomotives, look also by the publisher of that loco:\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Scenario Pack 17\n- Armstrong PowerHouse - Class 20 Enhancement Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 24/25/26/27 Sound Pack\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 166 (updated)\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Class 220 (updated)\n- Armstrong Powerhouse - Lighting Effects Enhancement Pack (updated)\n- Bonus content Oct 2010\n- Class 25\n- Class 2P 4-4-0 pack\n- Class 42/43 Warschip\n- Class 86\n- Class 111\n- DTM - 003\n- Edinburgh to Glasgow\n- German Railroads - Class 118\n- German Railroads - Class 120\n- German Railroads - Class 143 at work\n- German Railroads - Handbuch BR 143\n- German Railroads - Steuerwagen im Nahverkehr\n- German Railroads - Modern tanker cars\n- Iron Horse House - Class 20 Expansion Pack\n- Iron Horse Hosue - Class 20 Scenarios\n- Iron Horse House - Class 44-45 + All Expansions\n- Iron Horse House - Class 44 45 45-1 46 Peak\n- Just Trains - Class 66 (Updated)\n- Off the Cotswold Line C-S-S Pack\n- RailWorks_v114.0b_to_v114.1b\n- Railworks 116.3e to 116.5a\n- Rural Landscapes\n- Scale Rail\n- SkiDrow Update3\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this torrent, please leave a comment!\nPLEASE seed at least as much as you've downloaded so everyone can enjoy this Add-ons!\n\nMany thanks to all users that have ever uploaded RailWorks Add-ons!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ab76a129238db7889a3e1294150eb00679612d0","amp;dn":"Railworks+Add-ons+2011+-+Part+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ab76a129238db7889a3e1294150eb00679612d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,183,106,18,146,56,219,120,137,163,225,41,65,80,235,0,103,150,18,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
