Every Little Teardrop 4:00 \n\nBenny Gallagher and Graham Lyle were more interested in songwriting than performing and it was as songwriters that they first made an impact. The first song of theirs that anybody recorded was Mr Heartbreak's here again. Dean Ford and the Gaylords (later to become the Marmalade) released it as a single but it flopped. Gallagher and Lyle continued to develop and Mary Hopkin recorded Sparrow\nAt about that time, Manfred Mann disbanded (later to re-emerge with a different line-up as Manfred Mann's Earth Band) and two of its members, Tom Mc Guinness and Hughie Flint, formed their own group, Mc Guinness Flint. Gallagher and Lyle were offered places in this new group, which they accept. They wrote and performed on two UK top five hits for the group (When I'm dead and gone, Malt and barley blues) but the pressures generated by the success became too great so the group disbanded.\n\nGallagher and Lyle decided to continue as a duo, working at their own pace. They recorded some fine albums before, in 1976, they released their strongest album, Breakaway. Two UK hits (I wanna stay with you, Heart on my sleeve) both peaked at number six, while the title track was a minor UK hit. Art Garfunkel covered Breakaway and had an American top forty hit with it.\n\nAgain, Gallagher and Lyle resisted the commercial pressure to exploit their success although they recorded further albums and had another minor UK hit, Every little teardrop. They continued as songwriters, not always together. Graham Lyle had a huge international hit when he co-wrote What's love got to do with it for Tina Turner.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c33ee85262e0c1dc8a74c87ea6da1b54b301ab3b","amp;dn":"Best+of+Gallagher+%26+Lyle%281998%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c33ee85262e0c1dc8a74c87ea6da1b54b301ab3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,62,232,82,98,224,193,220,138,116,200,126,166,218,27,84,179,1,171,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
