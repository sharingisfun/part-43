It leads up to the more restrained and more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“classicalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ style of the Third Symphony, composed in the tranquillity of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AinolaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (in English, SibeliusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife, AinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s House). This was the Sibelius familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s country retreat some 45 minutes drive outside Helsinki after he had forsaken his more gregarious and hedonistic life in Helsinki. The other film, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Maturity and SilenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, charts SibeliusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work through to the towering grandeur of the single-movement Seventh Symphony. This is notable for its concentration of material and its originality of structure and unity of form. Then from the same period thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the great tone poem Tapiola in which Sibelius brings a different, original sound to the orchestra. The film then tracks through to the long years through which he struggled in vain to compose an Eighth Symphony - the pages eventually consigned to the flames in his green ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“F majorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ stove at Ainola, by a composer who was so exceedingly self-critical that he was not prepared to allow anything that would not satisfy his stringent standards.\n\nThe visual elements of the films are striking. As to be expected, there are many views of FinlandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lakes and forests through the seasons: sun glinting on snow through tall phalanxes of trees; wisps of smoke-like cloud threading through and gliding across the tops of massed fir trees; mists creeping over dozens of islands and little islets on silvery lakes or embracing rugged mountain tops. There is archive film of Sibelius walking near Ainola and many portraits of the composer at different times of his life.\n\nDETAILS:\n\n    * Language: English\n    * Subtitles: French, German, Spanish, Italian\n    * Run time: 151 mins (both films)\n    * Aspect ratio: 16:9 Anamorphic and 4:3\n    * Audio: LPCM Stereo\n    * Country: UK\n    * System: All regions NTSC\n\nDVD Extra features\n\n    * New personal introductions by Christopher Nupen\n    * New improved restored image quality\n    * Allegro Molto: an Allegro Films compilation \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fce7e59fdde0f3584f8dca9c5870e76a19d95ec","amp;dn":"Sibelius+-+%5C%27the+early+years%5C%27+-+%5C%27maturity+%26+silence%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fce7e59fdde0f3584f8dca9c5870e76a19d95ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,206,126,89,253,222,15,53,132,248,220,169,197,135,14,118,161,157,149,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
