RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRARÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s main features include strong general and multimedia compression, the ability to process non-RAR archive formats, ZIP compression and decompression, support for long filenames, programmable self-extracting archives (SFX), repair of damaged archives, authenticity verification, embedded file comments, and encryption. Unicode is supported in archive filenames, allowing non-English filenames to be handled painlessly. You can manipulate the parameters of many archives at once and view a volume sequence as a single archive. WinRAR can convert other archive formats to RAR and search for specified text and files in archives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7684efb1e23ee137ef67a5faba3746ba7890e46d","amp;dn":"WinRAR+4.00+Final+%2832bit-64bit%29-DM999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7684efb1e23ee137ef67a5faba3746ba7890e46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,132,239,177,226,62,225,55,239,103,165,250,186,55,70,186,120,144,228,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
