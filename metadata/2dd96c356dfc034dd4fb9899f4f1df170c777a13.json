April 7, 1975) was an American writer of hardboiled crime fiction. He is regarded by critics as one of the finest suspense novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. His 1951 debut, the pulp paperback novel Hill Girl, sold over a million copies. A dozen of his books have been adapted for the screen, most popularly Dead Calm.\n--Wikipedia\n\n  In Man on a Leash, Eric Romstead learns his father has been murdered--shot execution-style and dumped in a Nevada landfill. The police aren't very motivated to search for the killers, believing that they were out-of-towners who have already left the state. So Eric begins his own investigation, eventually leading him to an extended struggle with a diabolical electronics geek.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dd96c356dfc034dd4fb9899f4f1df170c777a13","amp;dn":"Charles+Williams+-+Man+on+a+Leash+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dd96c356dfc034dd4fb9899f4f1df170c777a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,217,108,53,109,252,3,77,212,251,152,153,244,241,223,23,12,119,122,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
