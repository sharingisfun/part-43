I only have this on vinyl and it's not in very good condition, so I uploading a copy that I found my self cause I can't find it here on TPB (at least not a working copy).\n\nThe Belgo-English band Esperanto had a short but intense career and \nproduced an extremely varied musical repertoire thanks to the many different \nnationalities, origins and outlooks of its members.\nThe line-up of Esperanto changed considerably for the third album. Keith \nChristmas had left for musical reasons and the band was looking for a more \nenergetic frontman. They met this time in London and published some ads in \nthe music press, including in the Melody Maker (Genesis had recruited Steve \nHackett through that channel). Esperanto auditioned and took on board their \nnext singer Roger Meakin. His special vocal timbre made him an ideal partner \nfor Kim Moore, female singer recruited in the same way, as their voices \nblended perfectly. The recording of the third album took place partly in London \nand partly at the famous chateau of Herouville near Paris where Jethro Tull, \nElton John and many others recorded in the seventies. The album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLast TangoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nwas produced by Robin Geoffrey Cable (engineer and producer, notably for \nQueen, Genesis, Van Der Graaf Generator, Elton John and Carly Simon). It was \nreleased in 1975.\n\nThis time, the group seemed to have found its musical and personnel \nequilibrium and the tour which followed was very successful. They played at \nnumerous famous festivals, including Reading, Newcastle and Bilzen among \nother engagements. The band also had a residence at the Marquee: an \nEsperanto concert was automatically programmed every 10 to 15 days in the \nfamous London club for several months. The European tours were also quite \nsuccessful, with memorable concerts at the Paradiso in Amsterdam and at the \nFestival de Montreux (Switzerland), with PFM.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e73a910a899485800cca523da37819407d678e","amp;dn":"Esperanto+-+Last+Tango+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9e73a910a899485800cca523da37819407d678e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,231,58,145,10,137,148,133,128,12,202,82,61,163,120,25,64,125,103,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
