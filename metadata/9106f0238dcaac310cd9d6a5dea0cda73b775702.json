The forces of despair and seduction? On S. Miguel in the Azores, RogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rio, a young man with old money, and his enigmatic wife Leonor host a garden party at their villa. The intriguing guests are an older unmarried couple, the philosophical and observant Irene, and Michel, a rouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©;. While RogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rio and Irene talk, Michel and Leonor go down to the sea. The conversations upset RogÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rio and capture Leonor's imagination. Five years later, the four dine at the villa. Michel and Leonor again leave the other two.
