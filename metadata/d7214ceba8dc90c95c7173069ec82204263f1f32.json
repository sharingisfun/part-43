When she was a child she was trained by her three martial artist fathers. Subjected to excessive physical and mental training, Motoko developed three distinct split-personalities known as Hibiki, Fujiko, and Mikiri. Collectively they refer to themselves as HiFuMi. Each individually skilled gained a mastery in combat skills learned from each of her fathers. As Motoko tries to live a normal high-school life she only seems to find herself in the most awkward situations, courtesy of HiFuMi.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7214ceba8dc90c95c7173069ec82204263f1f32","amp;dn":"Change+123+%28manga%29+%5BAdult%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7214ceba8dc90c95c7173069ec82204263f1f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,33,76,235,168,220,144,201,92,113,115,6,158,200,34,4,38,63,31,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
