An amazing film from 1978 starring the luscious Caroline\nMunro and her minimalist wardrobe of leather space bikinis. David\nHasselhoff's got eye makeup and a lightsaber, and Christopher \nPlummer IS the confused, golden-caped Emperor of the Entire \nUniverse. An Italian Star Wars ripoff of the most blatant and inept \nkind, filmed in English, from a French DVD. \n\nThanks to Cosmobells.\n\nI have provided my own [optional] MST3K-style commentary for\nthis film. Frankly I think the movie is funny enough without\ncommentary, but I hope I provide a few chuckles along the way. \n\nThe commentary is an MP3, separate from the film, which can be\nwatched without commentary.\n\nSee sexy space smuggler Stella Star do battle with amazon women\n for no reason! See stop-motion special effects that look like they\nwere done by Ray Harryhausen's blind retarded brother! With a score\nby four time Academy Award winner John Barry (James Bond films),\nwho clearly needed the money.\n\nCaroline Munro is probably the only real reason to watch this film,\nbut it is an incredibly hilarious movie, the perfect late-70s Star Wars\nripoff to watch while drunk.\n\nThe creepy Marjoe Gortner plays Akton, who with his blonde perm\nand man-makeup looks like a hellish clone of Mork from Ork, or the\nGreatest American Hero. He apparently has all sorts of special\npowers which are never explained. He dies on purpose for no reason.\n\nThere's also a green guy called Thor who no one likes, a cowboy\nrobot who could be Darth Vader's redneck cousin, the hilariously evil\nCount Zarth Arn and his stop-motion robots who look sort of like\nTinkertoy renditions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nDavid Hasselhoff, playing Prince Simon, doesn't show up til toward the\nend, but the Baywatch / Knight Rider star doesn't disappoint, first\nwearing a goofy gold mask, then showing his skills with a lightsaber (!) \n.... Like most of the men in this film, he also wears an incredible\namount of eye makeup.\n\nThere are also some stupid cavemen. I preferred the Amazon Girls\nmyself.\n\nOh, and an embarrassed, confused-looking Christopher Plummer, as\nthe golden-caped Emperor of the Entire Universe, has the ability to stop\ntime! Apparently. His performance is wonderfully vague.\n\nWill the babelicious Stella Star and redneck robot Elle defeat whatever\nthey're supposed to be defeating? Who knows? Who cares? At least\nshe dresses in a Vampirella - like leather space bikini for most of the film.\n\nEven by MST3K standards this film beggars belief. This was released on\nVHS in the US by Roger Corman, but he actually cut out some of the more\nwonderfully awkward moments. This is the French version, &quot;Le Choc Des\nEtoiles,&quot; which is uncut, and available in a 2-DVD set featuring a making\nof documentary and &quot;Starcrash 2,&quot; an even worse movie featuring none\nof this movie's cast and all of this movie's effects.\n\nI understand a proper American DVD is coming October 17, 2009. I hope\nit's uncut.\n\nDirected by Luigi Cozzi. With Marjoe Gortner, Caroline Munro,\nChristopher Plummer, David Hasselhoff.\nCommentary by Garrett Gilchrist.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:419b037c362ada5b0f85dde18bfbceadba6248b1","amp;dn":"Starcrash+%281978%29+with+MST3K+style+commentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"419b037c362ada5b0f85dde18bfbceadba6248b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,155,3,124,54,42,218,91,15,133,221,225,139,251,206,173,186,98,72,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
