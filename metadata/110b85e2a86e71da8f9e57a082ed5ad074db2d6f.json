The original tape here was run through 2 sequential equalizers long ago to clean up the sound a bit and makes for a pretty good recording for a bootleg from that era. One bad thing is that there was a bit of plastic that got jammed in recorder and creates vibrato-ish effect toward the end of what was side A of the tape on the original recording. On the bright side it sounds pretty cool and doesn't last for very long.\n\nAND PLEASE KEEP SEEDING SO I CAN ADD MORE STUFF.
