The prosecution are sure they have got their men, but a succession of witnesses who prove to be CIA double agents, convicted terrorists and arms dealers with shady histories begin to undermine a case which is skilfully and passionately contested by the defence.\n\nPresented by Sheena MacDonald.\n\nWith Ian McDiarmid, Denis Lawson and Hugh Fraser.\n\nBroadcast on:\n\nBBC Radio 4, 2:30pm Saturday 29th August 2009\n\n\nCodec mpga\nLanguage English\nType Audio\nChannels 2\nSample Rate 44100 Hz\nBitrate 128 kb/s\n\nDuration 1:27:41\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2961f84feb5f543fe1faea077343d6669a8d87a1","amp;dn":"Lockerbie+on+Trial++%28BBC+Radio+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2961f84feb5f543fe1faea077343d6669a8d87a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,97,248,79,235,95,84,63,225,250,234,7,115,67,214,102,154,141,135,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
