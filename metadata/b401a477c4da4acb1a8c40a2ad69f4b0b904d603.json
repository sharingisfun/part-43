Instead, the minute currents appear to alter and inhibit the ability of the outer protein layer of the \nvirus to attach to lymphocytes (reverse transcriptase process) This blocks the binding of the HIV virus \nwith the host cell (Thymic-T lymphocyte; CD4 T-helper cells) so the virus is thought in effect to be \nneutralized, immobilized and eventually eliminated from the body. Rate of recovery is the product of \ncurrent intensity multiplied by time of exposure. (Kaali; with Lyman and Merkatz; 1994 paper.) This \ncommunication describes a safe and tested procedure for interrupting HIV reproduction. But you MUST \navoid ingesting any medicinal herbs, domestic or oriental, since blood electrification causes \nelectroporation of cell membranes and can thus cause tremendous increase of molecular transport into \ncells resulting occasionally in extreme and toxic overdosing. Allow one week to eliminate herbs and \nother medications from body before blood electrification. \n\n(See J.C. Weaver, Havard-MIT Division of \nHealth Sciences and Technology in  Journal of Cellular Biochemistry  51:426-435; 1993.) \n\n\n\n\nUnited States Patent 5,676,977\nMarvin S. Antelman\nMethod of curing AIDS with tetrasilver tetroxide molecular crystal devices \n \nThe diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag.sub.4 O.sub.4) is utilized for \ndestroying the AIDS virus, destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens and immunity suppressing moieties \n(ISM) in humans. A single intravenous injection of the devices is all that is required for efficacy at levels \nof about 40 PPM of human blood. The device molecular crystal contains two mono and two trivalent \nsilver ions capable of &quot;firing&quot; electrons capable of electrocuting the AIDS virus, pathogens and ISM. \nWhen administered into the bloodstream, the device electrons will be triggered by pathogens, a \nproliferating virus and ISM, and when fired will simultaneously trigger a redox chelation mechanism \nresulting in divalent silver moieties which chelate and bind active sites of the entities destroying them. \nThe devices are completely non-toxic. However, they put stress on the liver causing hepatomegaly, but \nthere is no loss of liver function.\n\nThe present invention relates to the employment of molecular crystals as anti-AIDS devices, but more \nparticularly to the molecular crystal semiconductor tetrasilver tetroxide Ag.sub.4 O.sub.4 which has two \nmonovalent and two trivalent silver ions per molecule, and which through this structural configuration \nenables intermolecular electron transfer capable of killing viruses and binding them to the resulting silver \nentity so that a single intravenous injection will completely obliterate acquired immune deficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) in humans. Furthermore, said devices are capable of killing pathogens and purging the \nbloodstream of immune suppressing moieties (ISM) whether or not created by the AIDS virus (HIV); so \nas to restore the immune system.\n\nThe actual destruction of pathogens, ISM and the AIDS virus is effectuated by injection of a suspension \nof these devices in distilled or deionized water with a non-reacting electrolyte directly, i.e. intravenously, \ninto the bloodstream. A single injection is all that is required under these conditions. Accordingly, \nhumans injected in this manner, upon being inspected after three weeks or more had elapsed and \ncompared with similar humans that had been given placebos, were completely cured of AIDS. The \ncontrol group still manifested AIDS. Accordingly, the tetrasilver tetroxide device performed in concert \nwith and in full conformity with the ultimate objects of this invention. Furthermore, three out of four \nwasting syndrome terminal patients and four out of the five candidiasis terminal patients were still alive \nin 1995 after a year and a half had elapsed from their initial injection. By that time all the AIDS patients \nhad been released from the clinic and allowed to return home. \n\nMethod of curing AIDS with ... - Google Patent Search\nPatent Number 5676977\nhttp://www.google.com/patents\n\n\n\n\nColloidal Silver - a Cure for AIDS? \n\nIn 1991, an obscure but crucial discovery was made at the Biochemistry \nUnit of Upjohn Laboratories. According to the September 10, 1991 issue of \n&quot;Biochemistry&quot; states: &quot;Among a number of metal ions tested, Zn2+ \n(zinc), Cn2+ (copper) and Ag1+ (silver) were discovered to be the most \neffective inhibitors of renin and the HIV protease (data not shown). \nKenectic analysis revealed that inhibition of renin by Ag1+ (silver) is \nbasically identical with that observed with Zn2+ (zinc), in other words, \nconcompetitive, with respect to the metal&quot;. \n\nFurther testing at Upjohn, including a clinical trial, revealed that zinc was \ntoxic in effective dosages. This was the first reporting to be made that \nsilver is a highly effective protease inhibitor, and over the following years, \nthis same discovery would be made several times. According to the \nFebruary 13, 1992 issues of the &quot;Orem Herald&quot; in Provo, Utah, a full-time \nmember of the administrative staff at Brigham Young UniversityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s physical \nplant, Daryle Tichy, who considers himself to be a searcher instead of a \nresearcher by looking for patterns and answers to problems by crossing \nthe boundaries of different disciplines such as physics and medicine, \nstates he has determined that Colloidal Silver solutions will kill the AIDS \nvirus without harming the human body. Tichy said that he had the \nsolution tested at two different labs, and the results showed that the \nsolution destroyed a variety of pathogens, including the HIV virus.\n\nA year later, this same discovery was made at the University Medical \nCenter in Geneva, Switzerland, according to the December 30, 1992 issue \nof &quot;Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications&quot;, stating that \n&quot;metal-binding proteins are important components of retroviruses such as \nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Therefore, metals could be used as \nanti-viral agents . . . silver is a highly active bacteriacidal metal with little \ntoxicity for humans. Silver has also been shown to be a potent inhibitor of \nHIV protease&quot;. Three years later, Temple University in Philadelphia made \nthis same discovery independently of the other discoveries, as stated by \nProfessor Earl E. Henderson, Ph.D. He states: \n\n&quot;We tested the ability of biotic silver protein to inhibit human immuno- \ndeficienty virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in the human T-cell line, SupT \n1, as measured by syncytia formation. We found that pure silver protein \ninhibited HIV-1 replication in SupT 1 cells as measured by a reduction in \nthe appearance of syncytia in cell culture. There appeared to be little, if \nany, acute toxicity associated with the dose of biotic silver protein which \ninhibited HIV-1 replication . . . These results are very encouraging and \nsuggest additional experiments that could be done . . .&quot;\n \nThe following March 20, 1995, Professor Henderson released the findings \nof another experiment at Temple University:\n \n&quot;My laboratory has studied the effects of a special formulation of biotic \nsilver protein on human immuno-deficiency virus Type 1 (HIV-1) survival, \nand on latency reactivation of HIV-1 in the human lymphoblastoid B cell \nline, M57-3 . . . The results of the . . . experiment show that exposure of \nHIV-1 to 1000 ppm of a special formulation of silver protein for one hour \nat 37 degrees Centigrade completely eliminates infectious HIV-1 as \nmeasured by syncytia formation on SupT 1 cells . . .&quot;\n\n\n\n\nComment: I've also included some important videos from mychannel. \nThey are in a convenient 10-min format to make it easy you, if you want to upload them to your channel.\nSeed and upload please.
