But when they run into a group of preppy college kids who assume from their looks that they must be in-bred, chainsaw wielding killers, Tucker &amp; Dale's vacation takes a bloody &amp; hilarious turn for the worse.\n\n\nREVIEW:\n\nAn excellent comedy with terrific horror elements, this was a crowd- pleaser tonight at DIFF, here in Dallas. This is what writing is all about, old-school, when writing actually mattered, over special effects. And there are plenty of those. It is rare that I actually praise an American film, only because we no longer care about writing. It's all about star power without chemistry or talent behind the scenes, just what might make a buck. And, clearly, even clear results do not stop &quot;the machine&quot; from producing utter crud. Relativity Media has bought this gem, but apparently has refused to market it ala Bounty Hunter. This is such a funny film that fits into Bromance, Comedy, Horror, maybe even Indie. Did I mention there's chemistry? Talent? Yup. All there. So, get on it, Relativity! This could be incredibly profitable. Wish my blog had more power to get the word out there. Hope this does the trick.\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/3647/vlcsnap2011021107h16m29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/3647/vlcsnap2011021107h16m29.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/535/vlcsnap2011021107h17m14.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/535/vlcsnap2011021107h17m14.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img265.imageshack.us/img265/2343/vlcsnap2011021107h17m32.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img265.imageshack.us/img265/2343/vlcsnap2011021107h17m32.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a84f0879d523f279ae655052d6128db3883256","amp;dn":"Tucker+And+Dale+Vs+Evil+%282010%29+-+ENG+WORKPRINT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13a84f0879d523f279ae655052d6128db3883256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,168,79,8,121,213,35,242,121,174,101,80,82,214,18,141,179,136,50,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
