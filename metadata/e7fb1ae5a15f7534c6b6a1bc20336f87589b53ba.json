John &quot;Hannibal&quot; Smith and his team were framed for robbing the Bank of Hanoi (which they had done, but under orders), and sent to a US military prison. They escaped and went on the run, pursued first by Col. Lynch and later by Col. Decker. While on the lam, they became heroes for hire, working as good-guy vigilantes around the US or the world. Hannibal was their leader and an expert at disguises. Face was the team's con artist and lady's man. BA (officially &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;) was their mechanic, but also took care of mayhem and intimidation. The final member of the Team, &quot;Howling Mad&quot; Murdock, was an expert pilot, and a certified lunatic--they broke him out of a mental hospital whenever they needed him for a mission.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: Mexican Slayride\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½23 January 1983\nAmy Allen attempts to hire The A-Team, four soldiers-for-hire, to rescue her reporter friend Al Massey who has been captured by a Marijuana distributor and his gang of thugs.
