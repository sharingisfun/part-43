Joining just after the big boss has died, he finds himself appointed producer almost before he's taken off his coat.\nSkip soon discovers that The Duck Factory team wouldn't be our of place in the Addams Family. Wacky, wounderful and wild, they bring to cartoon-making what Eric Cantona brought to supporter relationships. The Dippy Duck Show is their pet creation and Skip, has to come to terms with all the zany, up-beat rock-heads who are now his new colleagues. Name a scenario - TV programming Awards ceremonies Auditions They always manage to ruin it, with hilarious results.\n\nIf you enjoyed Cheers, Airplane and Absolutely Fabulous, you'll really appreciate the humor, the biting one-liners and the brilliant characters of The Duck Factory. They takes no prisoners!\n\n\nN O T E!\n\nThis is a VHSRip, so the quality isn't that great. But it's good! So no complains about the quality. Just don't download then..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da151f306efb403d5287e9c43db34ac237d38c8a","amp;dn":"The.Duck.Factory.Ep1-4.Premiere.Episodes-VHSRip.XviD-stoffinho17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da151f306efb403d5287e9c43db34ac237d38c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,21,31,48,110,251,64,61,82,135,233,196,61,179,74,194,55,211,140,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
