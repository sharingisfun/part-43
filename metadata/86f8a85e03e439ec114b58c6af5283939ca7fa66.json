Steve (Gary Sweet) and Alexandra (Helen Buday) have two children and numerous grievances against each other. After a birthday in which Steve received a birthday cake and a raise at his job, Steve arrives home to find his family is gone and a videotape awaiting his viewing. On the tape, Alexandra lists all of her frustrations and begins to strip for the camera. She then reveals that she suffers from breast cancer. Before the now emotionally reeling Steve can recover, he learns that Alexandra has paid to have the neighbor he hates change the locks in the house. Steve is trapped inside with little to do but think about what he has done to his wife, and his only company is the video that continues to provide disturbing information.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Alexandra Project.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 695 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 975 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.1 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 739 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 256 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 2.35\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.188\n      StreamSize : 522 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 228 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 161 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0338706\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by nyrowa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f8a85e03e439ec114b58c6af5283939ca7fa66","amp;dn":"Rolf+de+Heer+-+Alexandra%5C%27s+Project+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f8a85e03e439ec114b58c6af5283939ca7fa66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,248,168,94,3,228,57,236,17,75,88,198,175,82,131,147,156,167,250,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
