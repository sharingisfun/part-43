You may also run into preventive maintenance and troubleshooting questions about input devices. DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect to find many questions like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow many keys are on the keyboard?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow does a mouse work?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The keyboard and mouse, the major input devices, are essentially throwaway technology. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot cheaper, in terms of both labor and parts, to simply replace a problem keyboard or mouse with a new module than to waste the time needed to repair one.\n\nI canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t quote statistics as proof (and I looked for them), but I bet that after power problems (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt worked fine this morning before the power failureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and printer problems (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat does online mean?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), the most common service problem involves a keyboard (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI spilled my Mountain Dew on it and for some reason it stopped workingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) or mouse (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe foot pedal doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem to work anymoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). If IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m right, and I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be too wrong on this, then as a certified PC repair technician, you should understand how input devices work, connect, and fail. You especially need to know how to plug in the replacement unit. \n\nQuick Assessment\n\nIdentifying common input devices \n\nThe most commonly used PC keyboard format is the ______ keyboard. \n\nThe mouse type that uses captured digital images to detect movement is a(n) ______ mouse. \n\nA(n) ______ mouse uses a ball and sensor mechanism to detect movement. \n\nDefining input device terms, concepts, and functions \n\nA(n) ______ mouse connects to a mini-DIN-6 connector. \n\nThe bus mouse attaches to its own ______. \n\nCleaning and caring for input devices \n\nTo remove paper bits and food crumbs from a keyboard, you turn it upside down and ______ it. \n\n______ and ______ are best for cleaning the ball of a mouse. \n\nTroubleshooting common symptoms and problems \n\nA 300-range error code displayed during the boot sequence indicates a(n) ______ error. \n\n\n \nAnswers\n\nEnhanced.
