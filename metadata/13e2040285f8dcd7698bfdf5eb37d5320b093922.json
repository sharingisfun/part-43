It allows you to run Windows XP in a very small, and light, environment. Also includes Firefox and Thunderbird by default to replace IE and Outlook. There are many more features I am too lazy to type up. It is a very nice OS if your PC does not have much hardware power (and if you do not want to use Linux, of course :) )\nThis is the BEAST edition; even lighter than the 'normal' version. Should include most drivers you will need. If not, simply Google the hardware name, and the install should be there.\n\n\nBurn the ISO image onto a CD,\nboot up,\nwait,\nPROFIT!\n\nNo serial keys needed.\n\n\nBurn and read tested on 2 different computers. Works swell, no errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, seed please, and long live TPB!\n~ Harry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e2040285f8dcd7698bfdf5eb37d5320b093922","amp;dn":"TinyXP+Beast+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e2040285f8dcd7698bfdf5eb37d5320b093922","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,226,4,2,133,248,220,215,105,139,253,245,235,55,213,50,11,9,57,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
