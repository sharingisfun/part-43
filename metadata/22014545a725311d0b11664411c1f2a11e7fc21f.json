Very much in the same vein as House of Mystery and House of Secrets, (as well as its successor, Secrets of Haunted House) Secrets of Sinister House was &quot;hosted&quot; by Eve (the character debuted in issue #6) and included guest appearances by Eve's children (officially &quot;cousins&quot;) Cain and Abel. All three characters would later serve as supporting characters in Neil Gaiman's Sandman. In issue #16, Eve was removed as host - as editor Joe Orlando departed from the title, replaced by Jack C. Harris - to focus on the concept of the &quot;sinister houses.&quot; The following month, she began nudging Destiny out of Weird Mystery Tales.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22014545a725311d0b11664411c1f2a11e7fc21f","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+Sinister+House","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22014545a725311d0b11664411c1f2a11e7fc21f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,1,69,69,167,37,49,29,11,17,102,68,17,193,242,161,30,127,194,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
