\n     \n\n        Since the Age of Enlightenment, the gap between the known  and\n        the  unknown has  shrunk considerably.  We have  mapped every\n        corner of our  planet and explored  our universe, but  despite\n        this countless phenomena still remain unexplained.\n\n        The Unexplained is a breathtaking new series from The  History\n        Channel  that  probes the  mysteries  of the  world.  From the\n        shocking voodoo rituals of  the Caribbean to the  secret alien\n        research centre  at Area  51, from  the shadowy  doings of the\n        Skull &amp;  Bones to  terrifying vampire  myths, The  Unexplained\n        will separate fact from fiction.\n\n        Prepare yourself for a chilling journey into The Unexplained.\n\n     \n                                           \n                EPISODE SUMMARY                  \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n        Studies show that  almost 20 percent  of Americans believe  in\n        UFOs.  And,  as  the much  publicized  Heaven's  Gate incident\n        pointed out, some of these  people will go to extreme  lengths\n        in the name of their  belief. UFO CULTS AND GROUPS  traces the\n        history of Heaven's Gate and compares it to another UFO group,\n        the Unarius  Academy, looking  for insight  into this  growing\n        phenomenon. Why do people join  these groups, and why do  some\n        abandon  all logic  and reason  in doing  so? Interviews  with\n        former and current members of the groups offer a  first-person\n        view of what they are like, and point out the vast differences\n        among them. Some are  truly cults, which indoctrinate  members\n        and force  them to  embrace new  beliefs and  behaviors, while\n        others are simply people joined together by a common interest.\n        From the tragedy of Heaven's Gate to the remarkable number  of\n        people who belong to UFO groups of all descriptions, this is a\n        thought-provoking look at a &quot;&quot;fringe&quot;&quot; belief that may not  be\n        as far from the mainstream as most think.\n\n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                                    Enjoy!\n\n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n\n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage\n\n        * Also we have a contest to annouce we are in need of a\n        * new nfo ascii artwork design email us with your designs.\n        * Winners artwork will be added as our new nfo\n        * dont forget to tag your work\n\n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n        * or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;df99b0adbcba9fb7aaacb7f1beb6&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ece726af1fa7f490fa49aeefd1f5e6aaba6ebb7c","amp;dn":"The.Unexplained.UFO.Cults.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ece726af1fa7f490fa49aeefd1f5e6aaba6ebb7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,231,38,175,31,167,244,144,250,73,174,239,209,245,230,170,186,110,187,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
