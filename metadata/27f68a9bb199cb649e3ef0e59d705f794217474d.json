So the crack is not a loader, patch, trial reset, or other kind of crack.\nNo program online registration required, and fully registered and unlocked! \n\nVersion v5.9.2 of Total Uninstall is basicly only a protection update, and \nthe developer removed the ability to patch the file &quot;Program Options.dat&quot;. \nTherefore updating to Total Uninstall v5.9.2 is NOT necessary.\n\n\n\nProgram Info:\n*************\nTotal Uninstall - powerful installation monitor and advanced uninstaller.\nTotal Uninstall is a complete uninstaller which includes two working modes.\n\nInstalled Programs module analyze existing installations and create a log with \ninstallation changes. It can uninstall programs even without the help of the \nsupplied Add Remove program.\n\nJust select from the list the program that you want to uninstall and in a few \nseconds Total Uninstall will analyze it and will show in a tree view detected \nfiles, folders, registry keys and values of that program. You can review the \ndetails and remove some of the detected items. \n\nTotal Uninstall is ready to uninstall the analyzed program. It will use first \nthe supplied Add Remove program and will continue removing remaining items using \nthe log. \n\nMonitored Programs module helps to monitor any changes made to your system during \nthe installation of a new program. It allows you to perform a complete uninstall \nwithout having to rely on the supplied Add Remove program, which can leave files \nor changes behind.\n\nTotal Uninstall creates a snapshot of your system prior to installing a new \nprogram. After the installation has completed it takes an additional snapshot.\nIt then compares the two snapshots and displays all changes in a graphical tree \nview, marking all registry values and/or files that have been added, changed or \ndeleted. Total Uninstall saves these changes and, if you decide to uninstall the \nprogram, it will reverse the changes to the previous state. \n\n\nFeatures:\n*********\n- Accurate analyze existing installations and create a log with install changes. \n- Monitor changes from registry and file system for new installations. \n- Uninstall completely and thoroughly analyzed or monitored programs. \n- Create a backup for a program and restore the program from backup. \n- Organize in groups installed or monitored programs. \n- Find the program to uninstall by keyword quickly and easily. \n- Summary and detailed information for each installed or monitored program. \n- User configurable views of the detected changes. \n- It shows a detailed uninstall log. \n- Powerful search in detected changes. \n- Standalone program agent for notification of running installation programs. \n- Export registry changes for install or uninstall. \n- Export installed or monitored programs list to file. \n- Export to file or print detected changes. \n\n\nChangelog Total Uninstall Professional v5.9.1:\n**********************************************\n* Monitored programs: Improvements in the &quot;Merge logs&quot; dialog [PRO].\n!

AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1. Norton Internet Security \n2. Avira AntiVir Premium \n3. avast! Pro Antivirus\n4. Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at February 14, 2011 - 20.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f68a9bb199cb649e3ef0e59d705f794217474d","amp;dn":"Total+Uninstall+Professional+v5.9.1+%2B+Crack+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f68a9bb199cb649e3ef0e59d705f794217474d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,246,138,155,177,153,203,100,158,62,240,229,157,112,95,121,66,23,71,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
