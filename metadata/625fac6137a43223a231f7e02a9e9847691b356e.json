He started his own band when he was fourteen years old, and released the first recordings of his own material seven years later, in 1985. Some of the same artists who inspired SexsmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, Ray Davies and John HiattÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are now people whose praise he has won.\n\nRon Sexsmith is the subject of the film Love Shines, directed by Douglas Arrowsmith and produced by Paperny Films. Love Shines premiered at the 2010 Vancouver International Film Festival on Friday, October 8, 2010.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Sexsmith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Sexsmith&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the course of his 12 album career, Ron Sexsmith has become revered around the world as one of the finest songwriters working in contemporary music. A singer-songwriter acclaimed by a galaxy of artists from Bob Dylan to Elton John, Chris Martin to Michael BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, Steve Earle to Lucinda Williams for his insight into the human heart and a melodic purity (to paraphrase admirer Elvis Costello) unheard since the heyday of Paul McCartney, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find him straight after the Sex Pistols in any self-respecting encyclopedia of modern music.\n\nProduced by Bob Rock, Long Player Late Bloomer features a star-studded cast of musicians backing up Ron in the studio, including guitarist Rusty Anderson (Paul McCartney), bassist Paul Bushnell (Elton John, No Doubt), keyboardist Jamie Edwards (Aimee Mann) and drummer Josh Freese (Devo, Nine Inch Nails).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ronsexsmith.rhinorecords.ca/shop/branded/ronsexsmith/Content/default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ronsexsmith.rhinorecords.ca/shop/branded/ronsexsmith/Content/default.aspx&lt;/a&gt; *** Pre-Order full Album ***\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
