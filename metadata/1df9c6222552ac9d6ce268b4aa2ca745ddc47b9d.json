The syllabi covers various topics on physical chemistry, organic chemistry, industrial chemistry, and inorganic chemistry. To cover a variety of topics in a single book, that too for beginners, is a very difficult task. We have tried to present the subject matter very lucidly so that the students can grasp it easily. Some portions of the subject matter have been highlighted so that the students can understand the important and salient features of the topics. The book covers the latest syllabi of West Bengal State Council of Technical Education. Short questions and answers are given in the book for the benefit of the students for semester exams.\n\nContents:\nAtoms and Molecules\nValency and Chemical Bonding\nNuclear Chemistry\nThermodynamics\nReaction Dynamics/Chemical Kinetics\nCatalyst\nMechanism of Organic Reactions\nIonic Equilibrium\nElectrochemistry\nElectrochemical Cells\nPhase Rule\nColloids\nTransition Metal Chemistry\nMetallurgy\nAdhesives\nExplosives and Propellants\nWater Treatment\nFuels and Combustion\nSilicate Technology\nPolymers\nPaints\nSolid State Chemistry\nChromatography\nInstrumental Methods of Analysis\nPhotochemistry\nRole of Metals in Biology\nPollution Prevention and Waste Minimisation ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df9c6222552ac9d6ce268b4aa2ca745ddc47b9d","amp;dn":"Engineering+Chemistry+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df9c6222552ac9d6ce268b4aa2ca745ddc47b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,249,198,34,37,82,172,157,108,226,104,180,170,44,167,69,221,196,123,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
