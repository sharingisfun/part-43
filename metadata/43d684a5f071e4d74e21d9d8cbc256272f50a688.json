Together with several pieces of early-1990s music, the soundtrack also included songs from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Many of the songs interpolate or sample other songs which feature in this or other GTA titles, such as Ice Cube's &quot;Check Yo Self&quot;, which samples &quot;The Message&quot;, which was featured in Vice City or &quot;Weekend&quot; which appears in its original form on Paradise FM in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories.\n\nPrimarily, the player can hear the radio when the protagonist acquires a vehicle. He can also listen to the radio in the audio options menu if not in a car. The station that will be playing when the player gets in is determined by several factors, and players can change it or switch it off as desired. The only vehicles in which the player cannot access the radio are the emergency and police vehicles (which use the Police scanner), tractors, bicycles, forklifts, the Bandito sandrail, and certain boats. Radio stations, or some of the songs featured on them, can also be heard in the background in certain locations, such as bars, clothing stores, clubs, casinos, and safehouse wardrobes. The Xbox and PC versions of the game allow the player to create their own custom radio stations with user imported tracks. However, unlike previous GTA titles, which also offered this feature, San Andreas can place commercials between tracks.\n\n\n\nMusic Stations\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBounce FM\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDJ: The Funktipus\nGenre: Funk, R&amp;B\n\nTracklist:\nZapp - &quot;I Can Make You Dance&quot;\nKool &amp; the Gang - &quot;Hollywood Swinging&quot;\nOhio Players - &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot;\nOhio Players - &quot;Funky Worm&quot;\nRick James - &quot;Cold Blooded&quot;\nMaze - &quot;Twilight&quot;\nFatback Band - &quot;Yum Yum (Gimme Some)&quot;\nThe Isley Brothers - &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;\nRonnie Hudson &amp; The Street People - &quot;West Coast Poplock&quot;\nLakeside - &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;\nGeorge Clinton - &quot;Loopzilla&quot;\nDazz Band - &quot;Let It Whip&quot;\nCameo - &quot;Candy&quot;\nMFSB - &quot;Love Is The Message&quot;\nJohnny Harris - &quot;Odyssey&quot;\nRoy Ayers - &quot;Running Away&quot;\nGap Band - &quot;You Dropped A Bomb On Me&quot;\n\nSummary: Bounce FM is a funk radio station hosted by The Funktipus (voiced by George Clinton) Surprisingly, Marvin Trill of WCTR's Area 53 host, calls into Bounce FM foolishly thinking that 'The Party Ship' (Bounce's sub-heading/nickname) is a genuine space ship, asking how to get on it.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nCSR 103:9\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDJ: Phillip &quot;PM&quot; Michaels\nGenre: New Jack Swing, contemporary R&amp;B\n\nTracklist:\nSWV - &quot;I'm So Into You&quot;\nSoul II Soul - &quot;Keep on Movin'&quot;\nSamuelle - &quot;So You Like What You See&quot;\nEn Vogue - &quot;My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)&quot;\nJohnny Gill - &quot;Rub You the Right Way&quot; (Remix)\nRalph Tresvant - &quot;Sensitivity&quot;\nGuy - &quot;Groove Me&quot;\nAaron Hall - &quot;Don't Be Afraid&quot;\nBoyz II Men - &quot;Motownphilly&quot;\nBell Biv DeVoe - &quot;Poison&quot;\nToday - &quot;I Got the Feeling&quot;\nWreckx-N-Effect - &quot;New Jack Swing&quot;\nBobby Brown - &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;\n\nSummary: Contemporary Soul Radio (CSR 103:9) is a new jack swing radio station hosted by Phillip &quot;PM&quot; Michaels (voiced by Michael Bivins).

Oberlander also inquires if his dealer has shown up yet in another song break.
