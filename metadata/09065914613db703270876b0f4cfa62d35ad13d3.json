BIG5 is overcropped on right. \nBig5 you are LIARS, you wrote about &quot;studio audio from R5 on NFO\nand you are really FUNNY speaking about us....\n\nproofs:\n\nNotes\nThe full dvd-R5 &quot;doesn't include&quot; english studio audio (VOB sample to proof is attached). The only studio audio available is from a pirate dvd and is not studio, the quality is low to be studio and is monofonic and... is from p2p, so no one crew can realize a &quot;studio audio release&quot; after this line or has to proof explaning where they get a studio audio, this is our source stereophonic. \n\nOur prevuously release called\nSeason.Of.The.Witch.2011.READNFO.R5.LiNE.XviD-iLG\nwas done a LiNE with out audio becaue the only one &quot;studio&quot; audio available was from p2p dvdscr so absolutely not allowed we just want to remembet to the nukers to do more attention (we also wrote on NFO that studio audio was not included on dvd-r5 we provided also a VOB proof) because someone else realized the &quot;studio&quot; r5 rel the day after and this should be impossible but release is non nuked.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09065914613db703270876b0f4cfa62d35ad13d3","amp;dn":"Big.Mommas.Like.Father.Like.Son.2011.PROPER.READNFO.R5.LiNE.XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09065914613db703270876b0f4cfa62d35ad13d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,6,89,20,97,61,183,3,39,8,118,176,244,207,166,45,53,173,19,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
