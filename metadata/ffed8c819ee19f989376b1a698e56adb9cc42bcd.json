Written by Peter Tinniswood; Performed by Billie Whitelaw.\n\nMillicent, a middle-aged spinster who spent her life writing obituaries for a regional newspaper, was about to be replaced by a computer. Her last obituary was due to be that of Dame Plunkett, a once-famous person who passed away at the age of 90. As she writes, however, she begins to reflect on the way she had become involved with her subjects, speculating on what they did in their private lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffed8c819ee19f989376b1a698e56adb9cc42bcd","amp;dn":"Peter+Tinniswood+-+The+Last+Obit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffed8c819ee19f989376b1a698e56adb9cc42bcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,237,140,129,158,225,159,152,147,118,177,166,152,229,106,219,156,196,43,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
