It will be the first album released by the second lineup of the band, featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, formed after original members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett left in August 2008.\n\nThe album was recorded between April and May 2009 at Sound City Studios and Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, California.
