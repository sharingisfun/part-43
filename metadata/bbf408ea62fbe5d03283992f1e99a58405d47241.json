Released in 1986, the single peaked at number three on Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and remains one of Jackson's signature songs. Paula Abdul choreographed the music video and appeared in it as well as one of Jackson's friends. The line &quot;My first name ain't baby, it's Janet, Miss Jackson if you're nasty&quot; became a national catchphrase. The song won Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Single at the 1987 American Music Awards. It ranked 30 on VH1's 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and forty-five on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s and raked 79 on Rolling Stone 100 Greatest Pop Songs.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf408ea62fbe5d03283992f1e99a58405d47241","amp;dn":"Janet+Jackson+-+Nasty+%5B1986%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf408ea62fbe5d03283992f1e99a58405d47241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,244,8,234,98,251,229,208,50,131,153,47,30,153,165,132,5,212,114,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
