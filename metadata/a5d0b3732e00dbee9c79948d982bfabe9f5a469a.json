Tracy and Warren Hymer play Saint Louis and Dannemora Dan, two hard-boiled but likeable prison convicts. While in stir, the boys befriend another convict named Steve (Bogart), who is in love with woman's-prison inmate Judy (Claire Luce). Eventually, Steve and Judy are released, whereupon they get married and head to a small town where no one knows of their criminal pasts. It isn't long, however, before the couple's future happiness is threatened by dishonest salesman Frosby (Gaylord Pendleton), the no-good rat who framed Judy. Frosby threatens to expose Steve's prison record if the latter refuses to go along with a scheme to defraud his neighbors. Learning of this situation, Saint Louis and Dan escape from jail, foil Frosby's scheme, and return behind bars just in time to play in a prison all-star baseball game! Nonsensical to say the least, Up the River is also a film that's hard to dislike. It was remade by 20th Century-Fox in 1938, with Preston S. Foster and Tony Martin respectively in the Tracy and Bogart roles. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Up the river.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 996 MiB\n      Duration : 1h 24mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 644 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate : 1 559 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.212\n      Stream size : 944 MiB (95%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 24mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 72.9 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 88.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 44.1 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 542 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5 --abr 88\n\nIMDB: tt0021508\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d0b3732e00dbee9c79948d982bfabe9f5a469a","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+Up+the+river+%5B1930%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d0b3732e00dbee9c79948d982bfabe9f5a469a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,208,179,115,46,0,219,238,156,121,148,141,152,43,250,190,159,90,70,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
