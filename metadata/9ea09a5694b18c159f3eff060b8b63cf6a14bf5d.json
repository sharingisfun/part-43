betraying Lyle Tyrus, the  ruthless\n        leader of a rural crime gang, Luke Cain has stayed away for 15\n        years to protect his wife and daughter from Lyle's  vengeance.\n        But his  daughter Emily  nurses a  burning desire  to see  her\n        father and Luke finally  agrees to meet her  at a cafe on  the\n        outskirts of town.\n\n        But fate intervenes when Lyle's brother Norman and his killing\n        crew chance by the cafe. They leave without incident but  Luke\n        knows it is just a matter  of time before they report to  Lyle\n        and return to exact their revenge.\n\n        Luke  is  forced  to make  a  difficult  and potentially  life\n        threatening  decision.  Should he  leave  his daughter  behind\n        again,  or  wait  for his  worst  nightmare  to walk  straight\n        through the door?\n\n        Only time will tell if today really is a Good Day For It!\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n              Robert Patrick         ....
