Yet while the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreen RevolutionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ succeeded in South America and Asia, it never got to Africa. More than 9 million people every year die of hunger, malnutrition, and related diseases every yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½most of them in Africa and most of them children. More die of hunger in Africa than from AIDS and malaria combined. Now, an impending global food crisis threatens to make things worse.\nIn the west we think of famine as a natural disaster, brought about by drought; or as the legacy of brutal dictators. But in this powerful investigative narrative, Thurow &amp; Kilman show exactly how, in the past few decades, American, British, and European policies conspired to keep Africa hungry and unable to feed itself. As a new generation of activists work to keep famine from spreading, Enough is essential reading on a humanitarian issue of utmost urgency.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e619c9875b1f427b50ad58001c266dd86133b4","amp;dn":"Enough+-+Why+the+World%5C%27s+Poorest+Starve+in+an+Age+of+Plenty+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e619c9875b1f427b50ad58001c266dd86133b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,230,25,201,135,91,31,66,123,80,173,88,0,28,38,109,216,97,51,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
