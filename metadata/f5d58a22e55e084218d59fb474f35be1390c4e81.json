On her travels she has witnessed some of the daunting and brutal challenges our ancestors had to face: mountains, deserts, oceans, changing climates, terrifying giant beasts and volcanoes.But she discovers that perhaps the most serious threat of all came from other humans.\n\nWhen our ancestors set out from Africa there were already two other species of human on the planet: Neanderthal in Europe and Homo erectus in Asia. Both (contrary to popular perception) were intelligent, adept at making tools and weapons and were long adapted to their environments. So, Alice asks, why did only Homo sapiens survive? Part detective story, part travelogue, and drawing on the latest genetic and archaeological discoveries, Alice examines how our ancestors evolved physically in response to these challenges, finding out how our colour, shape, size, diet, disease resistance and even athletic ability have been shaped by the range of environments that our ancestors had to survive.\n\nShe also relates how astonishingly closely related we all are. As a lecturer in Anatomy at Bristol University, Alice Roberts is eminently qualified to write this book. As a talented artist, she is perfectly qualified to illustrate it, and dotted throughout this lively book are many of the sketches and photographs from her travels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced &amp; Directed by:  Charles Colville, David Stewart,Philip Smith,\n-----------------------  Edward Bazalgette,Peter Oxley.\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle: The Incredible Human Journey\nYear:  2009\nFile Size: 744 MB X 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt;&gt; ( All Episodes 3,63 GB )\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:57:38  &lt;&lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt;&gt;  00:59:19 \nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1754 kbit/s  &lt;&lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt;&gt;  1806 kbit/s\nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s  &lt;&lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt;&gt;  224 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3) \nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (English Subtitles) \n                                   \n                                   \n\n                                  \nEPISODES:\n---------\n\n1) The Incredible Human Journey-Episode I-Out Of Africa\n2) The Incredible Human Journey-Episode II-Asia\n3) The Incredible Human Journey-Episode III-Europe \n4) The Incredible Human Journey-Episode IV-Australia \n5) The Incredible Human Journey-Episode V-The Americas   \n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397256/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1397256/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External Subtitles Included -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (English Subtitles) \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    ##############\n                                    #### NOTE ####\n                                    ##############\n\n###################################################################################\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view change the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d58a22e55e084218d59fb474f35be1390c4e81","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+Human+Journey-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d58a22e55e084218d59fb474f35be1390c4e81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,213,138,34,229,94,8,66,24,213,159,180,116,243,91,225,57,12,78,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
