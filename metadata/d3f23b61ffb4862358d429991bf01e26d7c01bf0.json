While her mother, father, and brother sit down to study the Bible, she is off skating, smoking, and doing other things her family considers wicked.\n\nOne day, while being chastised for her behavior, the rapture occurs. Her pious family, along with all of the other righteous humans, ascends to Heaven, while everyone else is left behind on Earth. God sends a message that he will now forsake Earth, and Satan and his demons rise from Hell to take over the planet.\n\nTen years later, Earth has become Hell, with demons, giant insects, and fire reigning. Humans exist as slaves, used for labor and sex. Bethany is working for the demon Lord Belial. Bethany then learns that there is one remaining gate to Heaven in Vatican City, and that if Bethany can get to it, she may be able to sneak into Heaven.\n\nWritten by Rick Remender and illustrated by Eric Nguyen\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f23b61ffb4862358d429991bf01e26d7c01bf0","amp;dn":"Strange+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f23b61ffb4862358d429991bf01e26d7c01bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,242,59,97,255,180,134,35,88,212,41,153,27,240,30,38,215,192,27,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
