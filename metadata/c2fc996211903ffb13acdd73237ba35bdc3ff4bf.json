As soon as I reach a ratio of 10 to 1, I'm clearing the hard-drive from those. Maybe, in a year or two, I can seed back from the DVD made from these ISO. But hey, he will be making a new stage appearance till then I'm sure, and hopefully, maybe, he won't need to;)\n\nPeace\n\n----------------------------\n\nDavid Icke\nMelbourne Convention Centre\nMelbourne, Australia\n11 April 2009\n\nThis is the full day talk on 3 standard PAL DVD's in ISO format.\nJust burn to DVDR's using imgburn, nero or similar app.\n\nIf this doesn't play on DVD players in NTSC countries (Americas &amp; Japan) then go into your DVD player options.\nUnder video options section look for TV system. Set the output to NTSC not Auto!\nIf that doesn't work you will need to either watch it on your PC or do an NTSC DVD conversion using software.\nSince this will be my only release, I leave it up to others to release it on DiVX,and NTSC DVD's for the Americas and Japan.\n\nExpect the initial seeding upload speed to be very slow or almost non existant between 2pm and 7pm eastern us summer time,\n7pm-12am GMT british summer time, 8pm-1am european summer time or 4am-9am Eastern Australian time\n\nDavid Icke's News Headlines\n\n----------------------------\n\nPage with links to avi xvid 2.7GB files;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rapidfind.org/upload/showthread.php?t=200129&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rapidfind.org/upload/showthread.php?t=200129&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rapidfind.org/upload/showthread.php?p=928716&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rapidfind.org/upload/showthread.php?p=928716&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2fc996211903ffb13acdd73237ba35bdc3ff4bf","amp;dn":"David+Icke+Melbourne+2009+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2fc996211903ffb13acdd73237ba35bdc3ff4bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,252,153,98,17,144,63,251,19,172,221,115,35,123,163,91,220,63,244,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
