Johnson and Marvin Stamm.  Herbie Hancock's on piano, Ron Carter and Richard Davis alternate on bass, Ray Barretto is on conga and Benny Golson arranged most of the tracks. \n\nThe brass gives the 'Tjader sound' an additional kick, while the typical Verve formula is retained with a mixture of jazz standards and pop hits of the day.  Highlights are a feel-good version of Windy, which adapts perfectly to the latin jazz treatment, a nice arrangement with some Brazilian percussion for the Baden Powell/Vinicius de Moraes standard Canto de Ossanha and some great soloing from Hancock on the longer pieces Django and Blues March.\n\nPersonnel:\nErnie Royal, Marvin Stamm (tp, flh)\nJ.J.
