Warren\n\nAppearing during the first three hours of the program, esoteric researcher Drunvalo Melchizedek discussed the great Earth activations fueling 2012 and what the Mayan Elders knew about the pending changes. He explained that the universe goes through cycles and that when the latest cycle reaches its conclusion, believed by many to be on December 21st, 2012, a massive shift of the Earth's poles will take place. Depending on how long this polar shift lasts, he said, the effects on human memory and the mind as well as the Earth's crust could be dire.\n\nMelchizedek, who has spent over 25 years working with the Mayans, detailed what they have told him about these impending Earth changes. He revealed that the Mayans believe that the infamous date in December of 2012 is actually &quot;the least likely day&quot; for anything to happen. According to the them, the event will take place during a window of time which began on October 24th, 2007 and ends in 2015. Melchizedek pointed to the outburst of the Comet Holmes in October of 2007 as the prophesied harbinger of &quot;the moment when the End of Time began.&quot;\n\nRather than fear these potential Earth changes, Melchizedek said that the Mayans see the period as &quot;a time to celebrate and be excited about,&quot; because it will result in positive advancements for humankind. &quot;Yes, there's a lot of destruction,&quot; he said, &quot;but there's brand new birth. A new humanity is born.&quot; Based on what he has learned about the Mayan prophecies, the impending event will result in humans entering into the 4th dimension where &quot;whatever we think or feel happens. It's a whole new ballgame.&quot;\n\nFull-Bodied Apparitions\n\nFinal hour guest, paranormal investigator Joshua P. Warren talked about full-bodied apparitions. &quot;That is sort of the holy grail of ghost hunting,&quot; he said of the phenomenon where spirits are seen in their complete form. He discussed a remarkable series of photos, found at his website, which reveal a full-bodied apparition of a Civil War soldier. He noted that, in the photos, the spirit drags its leg over a wall that isn't there in the present time, but was there during the war. Warren also speculated that perhaps the clarity of a full-bodied apparition may be an indicator of the proverbial &quot;age&quot; of a spirit.\n\nWebsite(s):\ndrunvalo.net\njoshuapwarren.com\n\nBook(s):\nSerpent of Light: Beyond 2012\nHow to Hunt Ghosts\nPet Ghosts: Animal Encounters from Beyond the Grave\nHaunted Asheville\nEvil in Asheville\nPlausible Ghosts\n\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95af8ff3f27e25ac73ad80f47c1faa80d819585","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Sep+10+2009+-+2012+%26+Beyond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95af8ff3f27e25ac73ad80f47c1faa80d819585","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,90,248,255,63,39,226,90,199,58,216,15,71,193,250,168,13,129,149,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
