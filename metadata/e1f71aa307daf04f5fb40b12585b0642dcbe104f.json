A humorous scriptwriter and virtuosic acoustic guitar player and composer, Williams reached the top of the hit parade in 1968 with his classical folk guitar instrumental, &quot;Classical Gas.&quot; Although it took six months for the single to become a chart-topping smash, it went on to win Grammy awards as Best Instrumental (Theme) Composition and Best Instrumental (Theme) Performance, as well as a Best Instrumental Orchestral Arrangement award for arranger Mike Post. An album featuring a re-recorded version of the tune with Mannheim Steamroller and Fresh Aire, Classical Gas, sold more than a million copies in 1987. The following year, Williams' album, Country Idyll, was nominated for a Grammy in the country music category for Best Instrumental Performance. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tFolk\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tWarner Bros.\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Overture\n02.All The Time\n03.Dylan Thomas\n04.Wanderlove\n05.She's Gone Away\n06.Here Am I\n07.Classical Gas\n08.Long Tiime Blues\n09.Baroque-A-Nova\n10.The Prince's Panties\n11.Life Song\n12.Sunflower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                      ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f71aa307daf04f5fb40b12585b0642dcbe104f","amp;dn":"Mason+Williams+-+Mason+Williams+Phonograph+Record+%281968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f71aa307daf04f5fb40b12585b0642dcbe104f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,247,26,163,7,218,240,79,95,180,11,18,88,91,6,66,220,190,16,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
