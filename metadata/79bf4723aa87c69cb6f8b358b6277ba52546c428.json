The other members are Phil Manzanera (guitars), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe) and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Former members include Brian Eno (synthesizer and &quot;treatments&quot;), and Eno's replacement Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin). Although the band terminated during 1983, they reunited for a concert tour during 2001, and have announced that they are recording a new album for a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.\n\nRoxy Music attained popular and critical success in the UK and Europe during the 1970s and early 1980s, beginning with their Top 10 debut album, Roxy Music, of 1972.[1] The band was a significant influence of early English punk music, as well as providing a model for many New Wave acts and the experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s. Ferry and co-founding member Eno have also had influential solo careers, the latter becoming one of the most significant record producers of the late 20th century, with credits including albums by Devo, Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay. Rolling Stone magazine ranked Roxy Music #98 on its &quot;100 The Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; list.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79bf4723aa87c69cb6f8b358b6277ba52546c428","amp;dn":"Roxy_Music-12_of_Their_Greatest_Ever_Hits-Promo-2009-NHH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79bf4723aa87c69cb6f8b358b6277ba52546c428","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,191,71,35,170,135,198,156,182,248,179,88,182,39,123,165,37,70,196,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
