Instead, O'Connor and his bandmates have filtered musical elements \nfrom the past through a contemporary rhythmic and harmonic sensibility to \ncome up with a style that sounds both timely and timeless. The trio is joined \non a few tracks by singer Jane Monheit, who delivers a particularly moving \nrendition of &quot;As Time Goes By,&quot; and by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, who plays \na delightfully abstract duet with O'Connor on the intro to &quot;Tiger Rag.&quot; All of \nthe musicians here are at the top of their game, but O'Connor's playing, \nwhich blends his formidable technique with deep emotion, is particularly fine. \nStephane would be proud. --Michael Simmons\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd574c37d5814bdcb9661c4009289f234ca511b1","amp;dn":"Mark+O%5C%27Connors+Full+Swing+Trio+-+In+Full+Swing+%282003%29+%5BEAC-APE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd574c37d5814bdcb9661c4009289f234ca511b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,87,76,55,213,129,75,220,185,102,28,64,9,40,159,35,76,165,17,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
