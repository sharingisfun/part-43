Written by C.S. Forester; Full cast dramatisation starring Scott Arthur, Matthew Gravelle, Keiron Self, Don Gilet, Kevin Doyle and Richard Nicholls; Adapted by Mike Walker; Produced by Polly Thomas.\n\nPartisan groups under charismatic leaders wage a desperate battle in this story of guerrilla warfare set in Napoleonic Spain. The hero of The Gun is the gun itself, a massive 18 pounder that is dragged across the mountains and plains of Spain - an epic task. Throughout the story, the gun changes the lives of those who fight each other to the death in order to gain control of it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1eba02b997c4b312c6f2cecdbbd3d8435d9af3","amp;dn":"C.S.+Forester+-+The+Gun+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1eba02b997c4b312c6f2cecdbbd3d8435d9af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,30,186,2,185,151,196,179,18,198,242,206,205,187,211,216,67,93,154,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
