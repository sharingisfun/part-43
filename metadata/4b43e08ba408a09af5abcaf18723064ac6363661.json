(Magazines, as in periodicals, not as in ammunition feeding devices.)\n\nThese are new, original scans. These have never been posted anywhere before.\n\nI will be slow seeding this and my half-dozen other torrents for a few days, so please be patient. (Also, seed when you get 100%). I will come on and drop off every so often, but I promise to get dozens of seeders before killing my seed permanently.\n\nAlso, please check my other torrents. I posted almost 11GB of gun magazines yesterday (1-28-2011.) I should post another 10GB in a week, then 10GB more a week after that, and so on. I have about 10GB of magazines, plus my lifetime collection of reloading manuals, books on tactics, and books on gunsmithing before I even get to the NRA Firearms Classics Collection. I should do about a dump a week for another month.\n\nRecycledElectrons","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b43e08ba408a09af5abcaf18723064ac6363661","amp;dn":"GUN+PERIODICALS+JAN+29+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b43e08ba408a09af5abcaf18723064ac6363661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,67,224,139,164,8,160,154,245,171,202,241,135,35,6,74,198,54,54,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
