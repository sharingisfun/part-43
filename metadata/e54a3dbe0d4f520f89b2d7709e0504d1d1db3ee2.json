I have scanned the cover which is the same for\nfront and back of the box. I have omitted the 80 page book that is included with the set because it\nwould take me hours to scan. If you want the book bad enough then buy the box set. I will upload one\ndisc a day. This set is a combination of the soundtrack and follow up album with the exception Ten\nYears After and Rock and Soul Music by Country Joe and the Fish.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Years-Back-Yasgurs-Limited/dp/B002E2QHBS/ref=pd_sim_d_8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlthough I was old enough to be at Woodstock, I was not there. However, I was lucky enough to see Janis\nJoplin two months before she died. I saw a few other groups during that time period but stopped going\nto concerts after a riot broke out when Sly and the Family Stone failed to appear for a free outdoor\nperformance in Chicago on August 9, 1970. I have some pics of the riot just as it started but I cannot\nfind them.\n\nIf you have difficulty with burning these you should shorten the file names and edit the cue sheet.\n\nPlease help seed these torrents. Enjoy.\n\n\n\nDon't forget to thank all of the uploaders on the site who are donating\ntheir time and bandwidth to bring you the finest quality rips in flac\nformat.\n\n\nThis item has been discontinued by the manufacturer.\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e54a3dbe0d4f520f89b2d7709e0504d1d1db3ee2","amp;dn":"Woodstock+Forty+Years+On+Back+to+Max+Yasgur%5C%27s+Disc+1%28Ltd+Ed+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e54a3dbe0d4f520f89b2d7709e0504d1d1db3ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,74,61,190,13,79,82,15,137,178,215,112,158,5,4,209,209,219,62,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
