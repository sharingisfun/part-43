Blues has evolved from an unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of African-American slaves (imported from West Africa; principally present day Mali, Senegal, the Gambia and Ghana).\n           Blues began as the music of black sharecroppers in the poor cotton-farming region of the Mississippi Delta, and traveled north to Chicago with the sharecroppers as thousands of them moved north in search of a better life. It was in Chicago that the blues went from acoustic solo guitar music to electric guitar-electric bass-drums combos.\n            Blues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the Delta, Piedmont, Jump and Chicago blues styles. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.\n\n\n02.01  Delta Blues artists - Prewar blues : \n \n             The Delta blues is one of the earliest styles of blues music. Guitar and harmonica are the dominant instruments used. &quot;Delta blues&quot; is a style as much as a geographical appellation: Skip James and Elmore James, who were not born in the Delta, were considered Delta blues musicians. Performers traveled throughout the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee. Eventually, Delta blues spread out across the country, giving rise to a host of regional variations, including &quot;Chicago blues&quot; and &quot;Detroit blues&quot;. Muddy Waters, Little Milton, B.B. King, and Howlin' Wolf were just a few of these important Chicago blues artists. \n             List of artists : Ishman Bracey ,Willie Brown, Robert Johnson, Tommy Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson ,Paul Jones, R.L.

Electric blues used amplified electric guitars, electric bass, drums, and harmonica played through a microphone. Chicago became a center for electric blues in the early 1950s. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. \n\n\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  HEY HEY  (1952)\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  HOW YOU WANT IT DONE  (1952)\n         BIG BILL BROONZY  -  WORRIED MAN BLUES   (1952)\n         THE HOWLIN' WOLF  -   SMOKESTACK LIGHTNIN'  (1956)\n         SKIP JAMES  -  ALL NIGHT LONG \n         DR.
