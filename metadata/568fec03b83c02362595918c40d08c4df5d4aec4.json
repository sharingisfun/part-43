I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going &quot;Hey, did you hear the new blah blah...\n\nSo, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out. Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. \n\nThis music is a lot more Indie stuff, with Electro-Pop, Dance, Rap, Folk all in one mix-tape. Some of my favorite Rappers released albums recently, which is added, but I separated them in case you absolutely hate rap/can &quot;unselect&quot; them easier.\n\nIn addition this month, I added a folder of &quot;B-Sides&quot; or &quot;Extras&quot; that I did not deem worthy to be on the A-Side, but it would behoove me to not add them.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n=========================================\nDid.You Hear The New Mixtape?
