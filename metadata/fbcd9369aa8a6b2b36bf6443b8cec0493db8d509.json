This album focuses more on IshamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s talents as an electronic composer than future releases. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomething Nice for My DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is purely electronic and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMen Before the MirrorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ only features a brief segment of trumpet at the beginning.\n\nThe tone of the album ranges from sweeping and melancholy (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the Threshold of LibertyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the Blue DistanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to light and humorous (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomething Nice for My DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMr. MotoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s PenguinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).\n\nThe most experimental piece on the album is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSympathy and AcknowledgementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the full title of the song being &quot;Thank you for your Sympathy and Acknowledgement of my Disease&quot;. This piece is centered around a complex arrangement of electronic sequences and processed trumpet and piano recordings.\n\nThe most famous piece on the album is a military-style march titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the Threshold of LibertyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Over the years this piece has appeared on several Windham Hill samplers. A reworking of this piece was used as the theme of the 2000 film Rules of Engagement starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOn the Threshold of LibertyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes its title from a 1929 painting by the Belgian surrealist RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Magritte.\n\nAll instrumentation was performed by Isham except additional electronic percussion and snare drum by former Group 87 drummer Peter Van Hooke.\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1.
