Below you will find some helpful information on the functions of a registry and the ways in which RegCure will keep your PC running at optimum speed and performance.\n\nGetting to Know Your Registry\nThe registry is a key component of the Windows operating system.  Without it, Windows would not be able to run.  The registry is stored on your computer in several files and depending upon your version of Windows, there will be different files and different locations for these files.\n\nDownload the Free Scan from www.RegCure.comThe registry records the relationship between hardware, memory space, and addressing.  It contains information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of the computer. Whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry.  The operating system continually references this information during its operation.\nWhy take the Risk? Let RegCure Clean Your Registry\nSafely and Effectively!\n\nWhen the registry becomes very large, the computer's performance can decrease and cause it to become unstable. Some computer users will spend a lot of time and effort going through the registry and editing it manually. Not only can this be a daunting task, it is also a risky one.\n\nRegCure cleans and optimizes your Windows Registry\n  \t  \t \n\n    * COM/ActiveX\n    * uninstall Entries\n    * Font Entries\n    * Shared DLLs\n    * Application Paths\n    * Help Files Information\n\n\t\n\n    * Windows Startup Items\n    * File/Path References\n    * Program Shortcuts\n    * Empty Registry Keys\n    * Shell Extensions\n    * Custom scans\n\n\t\n\n    * Automatic scanning with the scheduling tool\n    * Selection and removal\n    * Ignore list\n    * Automatic repair\n    * Backup and restore\n    * Startup management\n\nWin/All\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a7970f0cf6ef647354ce22ddbcb151de872e5c","amp;dn":"RegCure+2.0.0.0-crack+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a7970f0cf6ef647354ce22ddbcb151de872e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,167,151,15,12,246,239,100,115,84,206,34,221,188,177,81,222,135,46,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
