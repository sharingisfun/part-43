After a brief apprenticeship in Joonisfilm, he directed his first film Is the Earth Round? in 1977.\n\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rn's most important films are considered to be Triangle (1982), Breakfast on the Grass (1987), Hotel E (1991), 1895 (co-directed by Janno PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âµldma, 1995) and Night of the Carrots (1998).\n\nPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rn's style is charactericed by black humour, playful surrealism and a unique graphical style. His somewhat crude style marked the departure from both Rein Raamat's overtly serious and moralizing films as well as the Disneyesque style propagated by the directors of Soyuzmultfilm. In his footsteps (and occasionally copying his style to a large degree) have followed numerous new generation Estonian film makers, most notably ÃƒÆ’Ã…â€œlo Pikkov and Priit Tender.\n\nInfluences of PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rn's graphical style can be also be seen in such commercial animated series as Rugrats and AAAHH!!! Real Monsters!.\n\nIn 2002 PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rn was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Animated Film Association.\n\n\noriginal title: Eine Murul\nenglish title: Breakfast on the Grass\nyear: 1987\nresolution: 544 x 400\nruntime: 24:19\nformat: avi\nSubtitles: english\n\n\noriginal title: Karl ja Marylin\nenglish title: Karl and Marylin\nyear: 2003\nresolution: 640 x 352\nruntime: 23:44\nformat: avi\n\n\noriginal title: Hotell E\nenglish title: Hotel E\nyear: 1992\nresolution: 704 x 528\nruntime: 28:48\nformat: avi\n\n\noriginal title: Aeg Maha\nenglish title: Time Out\nyear: 1984\nresolution: 544 x 400\nruntime: 09:05\nformat: avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5700ab96d7290d7cbcb83dc0aff253f5798eac1e","amp;dn":"Priit+Parn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5700ab96d7290d7cbcb83dc0aff253f5798eac1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,0,171,150,215,41,13,124,188,184,61,192,175,242,83,245,121,142,172,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
