Dramatically recreating the conditions and motives that surrounded the fateful night of November 5 1605, she unravels the tangled web of religion and politics that spawned the plot. \n\n\n\n'Told with impressive scholarship and panache...The result is a narrative that is clear, balanced, and builds to its denouement with a sense of pace and tension worthy of a John le Carre novel' John Adamson, Sunday Telegraph.\n\n\n\nFor those among you who have read other historical narratives by Antonia Fraser you will know that her depth of research and story telling skills are beyond reproach. And so it is with this book.\n\nThe book outlines not only the details of the conspiracy itself but also sets the scene by explaining the very real persecution that catholics were exposed to in the last years of Elizabeth's reign and how they hoped, and indeed believed, that they would achieve toleration once James was securely on the English throne.\n\nOne aspect of the book which I found particulary fascinating was in respect of how little things have changed over the last four hundred years. We still have politicians who are prepared to make all kinds of promises before they gain power which they have no intention of actually keeping. We also have politicians who have no qualms about lying to us about the real dangers posed by our so called enemies in order that they can implement policies which are beneficial to themselves. And, of course, even in the twenty first century we still have religious extremists who are prepared to bomb London in order to further their cause, though not thankfully those with catholic sympathies anymore.\n\nAs we would expect from a historical writer who has written so extensively about female historical characters she places much emphasis on the women who are connected to the powder treason, most notably Anne and Eliza Vaux. She also betrays her catholic sympathies, not so much by supporting the conspirators which she doesn't, but by her very sympathetic portrayal of the Jesuits and lay men who were part of the story, though not of the conspiracy.\n\nIn summary, I would highly recommend this book not only because it is a very good read but also because in many important respects many aspects of the narrative are still highly relevant today. \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbaf65f9eb6047f3b7d352cd2851230811941446","amp;dn":"The+Gunpowder+Plot%3A+Terror+and+Faith+in+1605++-++Antonia+Fraser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbaf65f9eb6047f3b7d352cd2851230811941446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,175,101,249,235,96,71,243,183,211,82,205,40,81,35,8,17,148,20,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
