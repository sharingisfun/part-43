ELO was formed in Birmingham, England in the autumn of 1970 from the ashes of the eccentric art-pop combo the Move, reuniting frontman Roy Wood with guitarist/composer Jeff Lynne, bassist Rick Price, and drummer Bev Bevan. Announcing their intentions to &quot;pick up where 'I Am the Walrus' left off,&quot; the quartet sought to embellish their engagingly melodic rock with classical flourishes, tapping French horn player Bill Hunt and violinist Steve Woolam to record their self-titled debut LP (issued as No Answer in the U.S.). In the months between the sessions for the album and its eventual release, the Move embarked on their farewell tour, with Woolam exiting the ELO lineup prior to the enlistment of violinist Wilf Gibson, bassist Richard Tandy, and cellists Andy Craig and Hugh McDowell; despite the lengthy delay, Electric Light Orchestra sold strongly, buoyed by the success of the U.K. Top Ten hit &quot;10538 Overture.&quot;  \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nLabel:\t\t\tEpic\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Twilight\n02.Do Ya\n03.Can't Get It Out Of My Head\n04.Latitude 88 North\n05.It's Over\n06.Ticket To The Moon\n07.Heaven Only Knows\n08.Starlight\n09.Four Little Diamonds\n10.Secret Messages\n11.Eldorado\n12.So Serious\n13.Last Train To London\n14.In My Own Time\n15.Destination Unknown\n16.The Way Life's Meant To Be\n17.One Summer Dream\n18.Calling America\n19.Moment In Paradise\n20.Surrender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                      ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41bacf937cddc2ce9d687cf5c97c5bacf611085f","amp;dn":"Electric+Light+Orchestra+-+Very+Best+Of+Vol.+2+%282007%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41bacf937cddc2ce9d687cf5c97c5bacf611085f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,186,207,147,124,221,194,206,157,104,124,245,201,124,91,172,246,17,8,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
