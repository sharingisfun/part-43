GyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rgy BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ron reflects on the director's hitherto unrecognised obsession.\n\n&quot;Jewish themes&quot;? Let's put the term in quotes, because what would count as a &quot;theme&quot;? The Hungarian-themed SzegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nylegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nyek (The Round Up, 1965)? The Russian (Soviet) Csillagosok katonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k (Red and the White, 1967)? The Italian La Pacifista (1970)? If we discuss detention camps, is that a &quot;Jewish theme&quot;? Or what about the love of two Israeli citizens? And are these films actually about whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½per seÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their theme is?\n\nIn the oeuvre of MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³, films with a so-called &quot;Jewish theme&quot; (regardless of what we mean by this) play a major role, from the three-part JelenlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©t ( Presence) that he began in 1965 and finished in 1985, through to the half dozen pieces of the KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶vek ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼zenete (Message of Stones) series that he made at the beginning of the 1990s, L'Aube (The Dawn, 1985) taking place in Palestine, and two new documentaries with the titles ElmondtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k-e? (Have You Been Told?, 1995) and ZsoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r (Psalm, 1996). Throughout a hundred-odd years of film history, no other significant film director has made so many documentaries with an almost monomaniacal attachment to the same theme.\n\nWhy is it, then, that this conspicuous body of work in the JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ oeuvre is surrounded by a wall of cautious silence? Is it because of the &quot;theme&quot;? Is it about the usual restraint, confused looking aside? Or do we feel that JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ is being an unauthorised tourist in the area? Is the undeniable inconsistency in the quality of these works the reason for the bashful silence? Would it be embarrassing to applaud the &quot;good intentions&quot; of this great director?\n\nThe first part of the JelenlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©t series, to my mind, is immeasurably heavier and deeper than the second and third one. From the KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶vek ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼zenete series, the MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ramaros or the Moldavia travelogue is probably weaker and more superficial than the one about Budapest. The structural form of ZsoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡r is more delicate and fragile than ElmondtÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡k-e?, another Holocaust story and one shot on the same location. But if the work is uneven, why is it that we don't at least mention the worthy parts of this section of JancsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³'s work?....
