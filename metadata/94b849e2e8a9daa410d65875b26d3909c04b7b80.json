It was the first year I drove a car and put in my first car stereo with a cassette deck. I first saw Aerosmith at Day on the Green in the summer of 1978. I remember how Steven Tyler and Joe Perry seemed to dominate the stage and reach out to the Audience. The closing was Dream On and I don't think Steven Tyler was all together in his mind, I think the reefer smoke from the audience had gone to his head. I really enjoyed the other bands who opened the show, but by the time Aerosmith got through their first set, fans were ready to go home after being in the sun all day.\n\nby S.
