Goes deeper into metaphysical aspects and connects ancient hidden myths and history with modern ways of society and political outcome. Explains shamanism, duality, and reality behind DNAs and modern false beliefs. Overall, Kymatica is another excellent movie which attempts to point out the fundamental misconception that humankind are facing today that has resulted in imbalance between planet, nature and species.\n\n\nRun Time: 1 hr 23 minutes\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.tv\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29a494027e82cab9d145e6abe18467603c8eb07","amp;dn":"Kymatica+-+Sequel+to+the+Esoteric+Agenda+%5BAVI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29a494027e82cab9d145e6abe18467603c8eb07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,154,73,64,39,232,44,171,157,20,94,106,190,24,70,118,3,200,235,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
