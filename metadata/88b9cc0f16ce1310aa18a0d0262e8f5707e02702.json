The band's twelfth studio CD, The Ride, tries to shake things up a bit, and mostly succeeds by pairing the group with a string of collaborators similar to Carlos Santana's Supernatural. Only instead of the young hit-makers that propelled Santana's comeback, The Ride matches Los Lobos with early influences (Bobby Womack, Little Willie G) and long-time friends (Dave Alvin, Elvis Costello). \n\nThe experimentalism that fueled 1992's Kiko can be found here on a couple of tracks--most notably &quot;Kitate,&quot; a deliriously wiggy collaboration with Tom Waits and Martha Gonzales of Quetzal--but generally the focus is on blues, soul, and roots rock. Surprisingly, some of the strongest performances are new versions of songs previously recorded by Lobos: Costello helps the band re-invent &quot;Matter of Time&quot; as a piano and pedal-steel guitar ballad; Mavis Staples turns the folk-blues lament of &quot;Someday&quot; into rousing Stax soul/gospel; and Womack segues effortlessly from &quot;Wicked Rain&quot; into his '70s blaxploitation classic, &quot;Across 110th Street.&quot; Of the newer material, the band shines brightest on &quot;La Venganza de Los Pelados,&quot; a Latin dance workout with CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Tacuba, and the bluesy soul of &quot;Chains of Love,&quot; which shreds 12-bar formula by including a 90-second violin solo. The latter is a tribute to '50s rock &amp; rollers Don and Dewey, proving that the best road to the future is sometimes paved by revisiting the distant past.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n \n01.
