Long Shadows and the Dark Ages Revisited\n\nWe often call them the &quot;Dark Ages,&quot; the era which spanned the decline and fall of RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s western empire and lingered for centuries, a time when the Ancient World was ending and Europe had seemingly vanished into ignorance and shadow, its literacy and urban life declining, its isolation from the rest of the world increasing.\n\nIt was a time of decline, with the empire fighting to defend itself against an endless onslaught of attacks from all directions: the Vikings from the North, the Huns and other Barbarians from the East, the Muslim empire from the south.\n\nIt was a time of death and disease, with outbreaks of plague ripping through populations both urban and rural.\n\nIt was a time of fear, when religious persecution ebbed and flowed with the whims of those in power.\n\nAnd as Rome's power and population diminished, so, too, did its ability to handle the administrative burdens of an overextended empire. Fewer records were kept, leaving an often-empty legacy to historians attempting to understand the age.\n\nBut modern archaeology has begun to unearth an increasing number of clues to this once-lost era. And as historians have joined them to sift through those cluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including evidence of a vast arc of Viking trade reaching from Scandinavia to AsiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½new light has begun to fall across those once &quot;dark&quot; ages and their fascinating personalities and events.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093145a8be323f82a26dcd8525074b1879f4aca2","amp;dn":"TTC+Early+Middle+Ages","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093145a8be323f82a26dcd8525074b1879f4aca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,49,69,168,190,50,63,130,162,109,205,133,37,7,75,24,121,244,172,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
