Our unique approach provides disaster prevention, eliminating security, data protection and disaster recovery problems before they occur. Why recover from a PC disaster when you can prevent it?\n\nShadow Defender is using a unique method called Shadow Mode to ensure PCs are protected.By placing PCs in Shadow Mode with Shadow Defender, you can be confident the system is going to be protected no matter what happens.\n\nShadow Mode tracks each system change and redirects them to an unused location on the disk. These system changes can be permanently saved to disk, or completely discarded. With Shadow Mode, there is no need to specify regions on disk for backup or use BIOS functions to reserve space for OS images. Shadow Mode is the most efficient and intelligent way to protect PCs.\n\nShadow Defender provides non-restrictive, easy to use desktop security and protection for Windows operating systems. Shadow Defender is the best way to prevent unwanted or malicious changes from being made to a PC.\n\nShadow Defender can restore the system state before Shadow Mode no matter what has happened to the PC. At anytime, authorized users can save changes to the system, save selected files and folders or simply return the system to its state before Shadow Mode.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Shadow Defender&quot;:\n\nOptimal State - Configure your system exactly the way you want it ONCE and run in that optimal state at all times. No need to spend the time removing unwanted files or trouble shooting and eliminating unwanted PC changes.\nSystem Recovery- Reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for managing and maintaining your PCs by simply rolling the systems back to an optimal state.\nSystem Security - Surf the internet without a trace of unwanted cookies, internet history, temporary files, spam applications or spyware.\nVirus Protection - Prevent downtime and system damage due to virus and worm outbreaks. Prevent the virus from ever being written to the hard disk.\nChange Management - Maximize system uptime by instantly undoing accidental or malicious system changes.\nPatch Management - Safely test updates, patches and applications before permanently saving changes to your system.\nSoftware Test Optimization - Quickly run various configurations on one system for software test scenarios.
