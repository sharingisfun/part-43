In strict commercial terms, the band sold more records than any English act since the Beatles, though the cultural and musical importance was significantly less substantial. Conceived as a British answer to New Kids on the Block, Take That initially worked the same territory as their American counterparts, singing watered-down new jack R&amp;B, urban soul, and mainstream pop.\n\nThey were the first band since the Beatles to score four consecutive number one singles with &quot;Pray&quot;, &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot;, and &quot;Everything Changes&quot; and the first act to release eight singles entering the UK chart at Number 1. This new compilation features all the hits and a live rendition of &quot;Pray&quot; and the new &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; (Element 2006 Remix).\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Never Forget\n[02] Back For Good\n[03] How Deep Is Your Love\n[04] Pray\n[05] Relight My Fire\t\t\t- Featuring Lulu\n[06] Everything Changes\n[07] Babe\n[08] Sure\n[09] It Only Takes A Minute\n[10] A Million Love Songs\n[11] Could It Be Magic\n[12] Why Can't I Wake Up With You\n[13] Love Ain't Here Anymore\n[14] I Found Heaven\n[15] Promises\n[16] Once You've Tasted Love\n[17] Pray [Live Berlin]\n[18] Relight My Fire \t\t\t- [Element Remix]\n[19] Today I've Lost You \t\t\t- [Previously Unreleased]\n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:16m:58s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 189mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Pop\n\nOriginal CD Ripper \t- only1joe\n\nOriginal CD Uploader\t- only1joe\n\nOriginally Released\t- 21 November 2005\n\nRecords Company    \t- Sony BMG\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.takethat.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.muzu.tv/takethatbvgecngzfn\n\n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\nAny Errors In Torrents Or Music Files ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Leave A Comment On My Most Recent Torrent.\n\nCheck Me Out - Piratebay - Mininova - H33t - Demonoid - Torrentbox - Genesis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f304e52b1331865d52244647b7b62333f07f8e","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+The+Ultimate+Collection+-+Take+That+-+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f304e52b1331865d52244647b7b62333f07f8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,243,4,229,43,19,49,134,93,82,36,70,71,183,182,35,51,240,127,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
