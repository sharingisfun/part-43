The guitar is crunchy, the drums\nare heavy and the vocals are amazing. Not for the faint of heart. \n\nDavid Wayne fans have been left with another master piece. \nREST IN PEACE DAVE!\n\nby Gregg Downs &quot;Crypto&quot;\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - The Choice.wma                                                   \n02 - The Hammer Will Fall.wma                                         \n03 - Soos Creek Cemetary.wma                                          \n04 - Hannibal.wma                                                     \n05 - Burning At The Stake.wma                                         \n06 - D.S.D.wma                                                        \n07 - Nightmare Part II.wma                                            \n08 - Vlad.wma                                                         \n09 - Ballad For Marianne.wma                                          \n10 - Mississippi Queen.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n\nFollow Me On Facebook Pages: MarcelodrgzTPB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64abeab0abd2920ade459b81de184131a8c14454","amp;dn":"Wayne+-+Metal+Church+%282001%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64abeab0abd2920ade459b81de184131a8c14454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,171,234,176,171,210,146,10,222,69,155,129,222,24,65,49,168,193,68,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
