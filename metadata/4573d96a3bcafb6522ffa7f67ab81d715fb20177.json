Gylve had just moved into the neighborhood where the Sorkness brothers had their summerhouse. This young &quot;lad&quot; had the same taste in music as these two &quot;metal-heads&quot;, and soon found out that they were tuned into the same frequency. Gylve had enough music equipment to start a band and he also had plans to start a band for a long time. After a while they started the band Valhall. Kenth Robin Olsen, a class mate of Kenneth, joined in. The following years was characterized by hard work, rehearsing and recording. Already in 1988 their first demo saw the light and was titled &quot;Castle of death&quot;. The music style was a kind of thrash metal with black metal sound. Shortly after, they recruited Lars Brede Jensen on guitar who was also a childhood friend. Valhall continued to rehearse in GylveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basement. In 1989 was a new demo released, it was entitled &quot;AmalgamationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The style was a kind of hardcore/funcore. But one day in 1989 Gylve left Valhall to concentrate on his commitment with Darkthrone. A demo was released in 1991 &quot;Pagan token&quot; on which Gylve stepped in as a session drummer.\n\nThe years from 1989 to 1993 was a period with many changes of band members. Thomas Berglie(Khold) in 1989. Erik Lancelot(Ulver), replaced Thomas in the spring of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢92. Erik left the band, and K. J. LervÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥g(Paradigma) became the new drummer. Even Kenth Robin and Lars Brede left. But in the spring of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢93 Gylve called and asked if he could join Valhall again and things got started. The summer of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢93 was used to rehearse new songs and auditioning for lead guitarists. Geir Kolden was recruited on rhythm guitar. After a short while Frode Malm was recruited on lead guitar. One good thing came out of this period. Valhall got their own style inspired by doom metal bands like Saint Vitus, Candlemass, Trouble, Sleep, and other.\n\nIn November ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢93 Valhall went into studio for the first time to contribute on a sampler called &quot;The Reincarnation of the Sun&quot;. In 1995 was ValhallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMoonstonedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ released on the legendary MetallionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s label, Head not found. After this album Frode was given the boot and Robin was back. A couple of years followed with playing live and spreading the name. Frank Wanberg joined the band on synth/organ. The CD &quot;Heading for Mars&quot; was released in 1997. Then in the summer Geir left the band and Frank was Valhalls new man on lead guitar.\n\nIn the year 2000 Valhall recorded the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRed planetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album and has waited for the right opportunity to release this album. Their time is now. Philip H. Anselmo enjoys ValhallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music and want to release the album on his recently established recording company ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHousecore recordsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe are excited about this and looking forward to this with great pleasureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said the spokesman of Valhall Ronny. He also said, 'Housecore is a company close to Valhall's heart. Like they say: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½The main goals with Housecore Records are obvious: This is music for the real complete true fan of the underground.
