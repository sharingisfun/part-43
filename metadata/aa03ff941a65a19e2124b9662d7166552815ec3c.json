Upon arrival,  they  see  that her\n        claims are true  - but Michael  is not what  they expected: he\n        smokes, drinks beer, has a very active libido and has a rather\n        colourful vocabulary.  In fact,  they would  never believe  it\n        were it  not for  the two  feathery wings  protruding from his\n        back. Michael agrees to travel to Chicago with the  threesome,\n        but what they don't realise is that the journey they are about\n        to undertake will change their lives forever.\n\n&quot;We pre movies on requests&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa03ff941a65a19e2124b9662d7166552815ec3c","amp;dn":"Michael.1996.INTERNAL.DVDRip.XviD-R3QU3ST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa03ff941a65a19e2124b9662d7166552815ec3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,3,255,148,26,101,161,158,33,36,185,102,45,113,102,85,40,21,236,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
