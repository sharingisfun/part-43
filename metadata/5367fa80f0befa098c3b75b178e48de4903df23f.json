Everything is. You've got to keep that in mind.\n\n\nA bootleg album, released by Frank Zappa  and also available as part of the Beat the Boots! box set. A two-CD set, it contains a Zappa concert performance in Paris on February 24, 1979. The sound quality is good, and the set list varies from oldies like &quot;Brown Shoes Don't Make It&quot; and early-'70s favorites like &quot;Cosmik Debris&quot; to current material like &quot;Dancin' Fool.&quot; As such, it provides a good overview of Zappa's career. The album is also notable for containing &quot;Dead Girls of London,&quot; a song Zappa had recently written for an LP he was producing for L. Shankar that is otherwise unreleased on any Zappa recording. \n\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
