The group formed in 1990 (with original members: Ian (Bammo) Bamford, Lead Guitar &amp; Vocals - Paul (Rhino) Ryan, Drums &amp; Vocals - Mike Kidson, Saxophones, Trousers and Vocals - Andy (Waco) Jacobson, Keyboards &amp; vocals - Roddie Gilliard, Guitar &amp; Vocals - Naraish Nathaniel, Bass &amp; Vocals - Ian Jump, Lead Guitar &amp; Vocals and Roy Stringer, Apple Macintosh, samples, vocals and noises) for a concert in honor of Zappa's fiftieth birthday. They went on to perform his music as a tribute band, along with some of their own compositions, worldwide. Until his death in 2008, the band often featured guest vocals and percussion by Jimmy Carl Black, former drummer and vocalist from Zappa's Mothers of Invention, with whom they also performed songs by Captain Beefheart.\n\nIn 18 years of operation, the Muffin Men have featured no less than six original Zappa band members, along with original Mothers Of Invention drummer/vocalist Jimmy Carl Black, as well as performing with Don Preston and Bunk Gardner in 1993. In 1994 they played a nine-week European tour with guest vocalist Ike Willis, and again teamed up with Willis in 2003 for a special Zappanale festival show, which also featured Napoleon Murphy Brock. Zappanale is a yearly tribute concert festival dedicated to Frank Zappa's compositions. Mike Keneally has also appeared with the band.\n\nRather than play pieces note-for-note, the band plays Zappa's material working to the strengths of the current line-up, often giving the music a different slant to the original versions.\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nIan Jump - Lead guitar, vocals;\nPaul Ryan - Drums, vocals;\nAndy Frizell - Saxes, trombone, flute, vocals;\nDave Dominey - Bass, vocals;\nRoddie Gilliard - Guitar, vocals;\nJimmy Carl Black - Percussion, dialog, vocals;\nIan Bamford - Vocals;\nMoni &amp; Daggi - Dialog;\nJigsaw &amp; Blossom - Bleats.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01 - Big Swifty\n02 - Magic Fingers\n03 - Mammy Theme\n04 - Find Her Finer\n05 - What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body\n06 - Clownz On Velvet\n07 - What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body (Reprise)\n08 - Little Umbrellas\n09 - Let's Make The Water Turn Black\n10 - Come Up Here, It's Great\n11 - Halfway Up The Stairs\n12 - Packard Goose\n13 - Pigs In Space\n14 - Anyway The Wind Blows\n15 - Plastic Factory\n16 - The Air\n17 - The Return Of The Son Of Mr. Green Genes\n18 - Poofters Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead\n19 - What's The Ugliest Part Of Your Body (Reprise 2)\n20 - Big Leg Emma\n21 - Duprees Paradise\n22 - Big Swifty (Reprise)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a7b4297db29e6f3420a78c622b5d124416d911","amp;dn":"Muffin+Men+-+MuffinZ+%28Zappa%29++%5B1998%5D++%5BRobbie60%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a7b4297db29e6f3420a78c622b5d124416d911","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,167,180,41,125,178,158,111,52,32,167,140,98,43,93,18,68,22,217,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
