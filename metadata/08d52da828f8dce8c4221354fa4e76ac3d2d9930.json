This time they are faced with their fiercest threat to date - one that that puts the future of Torchwood and the entire human race spiralling into danger. They battle against the odds but do they stand a chance of saving mankind?\n \nWhat is Torchwood?\nThe Torchwood Institute is the name of a secret organization set up to combat alien threats to the human race. Initially founded by Queen Victoria herself, Torchwood's head office was based in the Canary Wharf tower in London's docklands. However, a devastating alien attack [shown in the Doctor Who episode 'Doomsday'] left virtually the entire staff dead, the organization without a leader, and the tiny Cardiff field office left to defend humanity on its own. Well, almost on its own...\n\nTorchwood's small Cardiff office (known as 'The Hub') was established at the end of the 19th Century, on top of a rift in space and time. People, objects and creatures from across the Universe and from all periods of time often find themselves 'washed up' in Cardiff - and it's Torchwood's job to assess if they pose a threat to humanity, and to either capture or destroy them if they do or to take care of them if they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Torchwood often works in partnership with UNIT, the Unified Intelligence Taskforce - a large-scale international armed force with many decades of experience in fighting alien invasions of Earth.\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08d52da828f8dce8c4221354fa4e76ac3d2d9930","amp;dn":"torchwood.3x05.children_of_earth_part_five.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08d52da828f8dce8c4221354fa4e76ac3d2d9930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,213,45,168,40,248,220,232,196,34,19,84,250,78,118,172,61,45,153,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
