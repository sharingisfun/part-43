Only a few fragments and letters remain of Epicurus's 300 written works. Much of what is known about Epicurean philosophy derives from later followers and commentators.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the books in this torrent:\n\n\n&quot;Diogenes LaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«rtius -- The Life of Epicurus&quot; \nIs the work of Diogenes LaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«rtius, a third century historian, which is from his book &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;. Most of the surviving letters and maxims of Epicurus himself are in this. \n\n\n&quot;Lucretius -- On the Nature of Things&quot;\nAlso known as &quot;De Rerum Natura&quot; in its original Latin, it is an exposition on Epicurean philosophy written by a first century Roman poet named Lucretius. \n\n\n&quot;The Philosophy of Gassendi&quot;\nPierre Gassendi was a philosopher of the Renaissance who revived Epicureanism and attempted to reconcile it with Christianity. This is not one of his works, but rather a book about his philosophy written in 1908 by G.S. Brett.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bc8eb4341822cbcfaef487633564f7cf0b6dd4","amp;dn":"Philosophy+--+Epicureanism","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bc8eb4341822cbcfaef487633564f7cf0b6dd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,188,142,180,52,24,34,203,207,174,244,135,99,53,100,247,207,11,109,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
