With Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World, author John Szwed illuminates the life and work of the titular folklorist, musicologist, author, archivist and promoter.\nSzwed fully immerses readers in LomaxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ world as he travels from his Texas birthplace, through the rural South during The Great Depression and up to New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bohemian scene in the 1960ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Along the way, Szwed maps out LomaxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inspired, unusual career, composing the definitive volume on the man and his work. \n\nThe Author\nJohn Swzed is a professor of Music, Anthropology, African-American Studies and American Studies at Yale University, \nHis publications include Blues for New Orleans: Mardi Gras and America's Soul (2005); Crossovers: Essays in Race, Music, and American Culture (2005); Doctor Jazz (2005), a book included with Jelly Roll Morton: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings with Alan Lomax (2005), for which he was awarded a 2005 Grammy; So What: The Life of Miles Davis (2004); and Space is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra (1998 )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7a1023d4eb4b4a1cbae6dd75a0f4d02e4726ab","amp;dn":"Alan+Lomax++The+Man+Who+Recorded+The+World%28epub%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7a1023d4eb4b4a1cbae6dd75a0f4d02e4726ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,122,16,35,212,235,75,74,28,186,230,221,117,160,244,208,46,71,38,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
