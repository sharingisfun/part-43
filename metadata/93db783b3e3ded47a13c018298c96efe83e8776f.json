It peaked at #16 on the UK Album Chart.\n\nA double CD version was later released. A DVD version of the concert, recorded at Wembley Conference Centre, followed suit and was released in 2005.\n\n&quot;Guilty&quot; was released as a single between the release of Incantations and Exposed.\n\nInitially during the tour the concerts were being recorded without the knowledge of the musicians, so that they could be paid less money; for just a performance and not a recording, the musicians found out, but the recordings went ahead and the album was produced.[1]\n\nThe artwork is linked to the title, as it shows a frame of film containing a photo of Oldfield in a concert arena.\n\nThe album was recorded at The Manor Studio's Mobile unit, and mixed at The Town House, London.\n\nStaff:\n\n    * Mike Oldfield ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars, producer\n    * Nico Ramsden ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars\n    * Phil Beer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n    * Pekka Pohjola ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\n    * Pierre Moerlen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion\n    * Mike Frye ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\n    * Benoit Moerlen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion\n    * David Bedford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, string arrangements\n    * Ringo McDonough ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bodhran\n    * Pete Lemer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\n    * Tim Cross ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards\n    * Maddy Prior ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n    * Ray Gay - trumpets\n    * Ralph Izen - trumpets\n    * Simpo Salminen - trumpets\n    * Colin Moore - trumpets\n    * Sebastian Bell - flutes\n    * Chris Nicholls - flutes\n    * Don McVay - violins\n\n\t\n\n    * Pauline Mack - violins\n    * Danny Daggers - violins\n    * Melinda Daggers - violins\n    * Liz Butler - violins\n    * Ross Cohen - violins\n    * Nigel Warren-Green - celli\n    * Vanessa Park - celli\n    * David Bucknall - celli\n    * Jessica Ford - celli\n    * Nick Worters - bass\n    * Joe Kirby - bass\n    * Debra Bronstein - choir\n    * Marigo Acheson - choir\n    * Emma Freud - choir\n    * Diana Coulson - choir\n    * Mary Elliott - choir\n    * Mary Creed - choir\n\n\t\n\n    * Cecily Hazell - choir\n    * Wendy Lampitt - choir\n    * Clara Harris - choir\n    * Emma Smith - choir\n    * Catherine Loewe - choir\n    * Philp R.
