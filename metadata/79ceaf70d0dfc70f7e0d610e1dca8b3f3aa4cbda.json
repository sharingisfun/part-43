Ms. Russell is cast as the wife of fortune-chasing Richard Egan, who takes her along to the Caribbean on a treasure hunt. The couple is accompanied by mercenary Gilbert Roland, priest Robert Keith, and Egan's blonde-doxy secretary Lori Nelson. While exploring the depths in search of untold riches, the little party is menaced by a band of modern-day pirates, led by Joseph Calleila. Partially filmed on location in Mexico, Underwater was completed in a newly-constructed underwater tank in an RKO Radio soundstage. For its world premiere, Underwater was projected on a submerged movie screen at Silver Springs Florida, and the invited guests were encouraged to don aqualungs and bathing uits so that they could watch the picture while swimming! A similar publicity ploy was utilized nine years later at Marineland of the Pacific for the premiere of The Incredible Mr. Limpet (1955). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048764/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048764/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3750215/underwater-es&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3750215/underwater-es&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:34:49\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 496x368 4:3\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 906 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79ceaf70d0dfc70f7e0d610e1dca8b3f3aa4cbda","amp;dn":"Underwater%21+%281955%29+Jane+Russell+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79ceaf70d0dfc70f7e0d610e1dca8b3f3aa4cbda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,206,175,112,208,223,199,15,126,13,97,14,29,202,139,63,58,164,203,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
