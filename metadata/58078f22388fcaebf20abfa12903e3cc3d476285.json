The Rose of Washington Square is cast as Fanny Field, the long-suffering girlfriend of no-account, gin-swilling prizefighter Jerry Moore (Robert Armstrong). After sacrificing everything to advance Jerry's career, Fanny is &quot;repaid&quot; when Jerry dumps her in favor of femme fatale Lillian (Gertrude Astor). Our heroine gets her revenge by telling Jerry's ring opponent to &quot;go after&quot; her man's nose, which was recently reconstructed by plastic surgery. As a result, Jerry loses the bout, but comes to his senses, returning to Fanny for good. Highlights include Brice's takeoff of &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot; and her song solo &quot;Cookin' Breakfast for the One I Love,&quot; co-written by her then-husband Billy Rose. Unfortunately, the public didn't respond to Be Yourself, and Fanny Brice never again starred in a film, though she appeared as supporting player and guest performer from time to time. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020670/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020670/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:04:43\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 640x480 4/3\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 913 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,10 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 44100 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58078f22388fcaebf20abfa12903e3cc3d476285","amp;dn":"Be+Yourself%21+%281930%29+Fanny+Brice%2CRobert+Armstrong+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58078f22388fcaebf20abfa12903e3cc3d476285","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,7,143,34,56,143,202,235,242,10,191,161,41,3,227,204,61,71,98,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
