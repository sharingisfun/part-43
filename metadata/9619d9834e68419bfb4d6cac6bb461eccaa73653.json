The eclectic cast includes Geraldine Chaplin, Bernadette Lafont, Kika Markham (Two English Girls), and a few members of Carolyn Carlson's dance company.\n\nRarely screenedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the film never even had a commercial run in FranceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this monstrous work deserves to be seen as a uniquely disquieting experience.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074974/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074974/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9619d9834e68419bfb4d6cac6bb461eccaa73653","amp;dn":"Noroit.1976.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9619d9834e68419bfb4d6cac6bb461eccaa73653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,25,217,131,78,104,65,155,251,77,108,172,107,180,97,236,202,167,54,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
