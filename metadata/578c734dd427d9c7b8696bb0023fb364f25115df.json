This is my 3rd seed using NO TRACKER and the DHT function built into most modern clients.\n\nMake sure your Distributed Database and tracker are switched on and also that you can act as a server to host the swarm files which you download.   Welcome to the future of file share.  If you are getting this then you have DHT working - just check you can make torrents as well with no tracker, just DHT.\n\nAzureus users PLEASE UPDATE YOUR CLIENTS, latest version is 4.3.0.1_B08 or later.\n\nVOB (mpeg2) files tagged\nAudio 320kps Stereo\nWide Screen 16:9\n\nPlease see torrent files for track listing details.
