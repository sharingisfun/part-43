As a singer, Yorke is recognisable by his distinctive tenor voice, vibrato, frequent use of falsetto and ability to reach, and sustain, notes over a wide vocal range. He mainly plays guitar and piano, but he has also played drums and bass guitar (notably during the Kid A and Amnesiac sessions). In July 2006, he released his debut solo album, The Eraser.\nYorke is frequently cited among the greatest singers in popular music; in 2005, Blender magazine named Yorke the 18th greatest singer of all time, and in 2008 he was ranked #66 in Rolling Stone magazine's &quot;100 Greatest Singers of all Time.&quot;\n_____________________________________________\n-\nINCLUDED:\n-\nRadiohead\n-Pablo Honey\n-The Bends\n-Amnesiac\n-Hail to the Thief\n-Kid A\n-OK Computer\n-In Rainbows (both discs)\n-\nBjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk\n-NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ttÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºra - Single\n---&quot;NÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ttÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºra&quot; (ft.
