Some Internet connections\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· have a very small packet buffer for incoming data. This buffer is quickly\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· overrun when too much data is received, leading to packet loss. The packet\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· loss is then detected by the sending TCP and the rate of transmission is lowered. Nevertheless, this leads to higher ping times and packet loss for all data received, even UDP data used for Gaming or VoIP. Tests show that the packet loss rate can be as high as 5%.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Now cFosSpeed detects this packet loss in TCP streams and keeps the streams from sending too much data. This avoids packet loss, leading to much lower loss rates, fewer SACKs and sometimes much better throughput. The feature is on by default, but can be switched off by setting &quot;spd gset avoid_loss 0 -save&quot; or switching off &quot;Packet loss avoidance&quot; under Options, Settings, Preferences.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· New parameters to set the desired ping delays in both directions: tx_delay, tx_width, rx_delay and rx_width. cFos...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2d6f5e24267af29ab2133dd5194f7a3e7130fd","amp;dn":"cFosspeed+v6.50+%5Bx86%2Fx64%5D+%5B2011%5D+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e2d6f5e24267af29ab2133dd5194f7a3e7130fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,45,111,94,36,38,122,242,154,178,19,61,213,25,79,122,62,113,48,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
