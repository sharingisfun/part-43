It was released as the album's third single in a digital format on 25 August 2009, with a physical version released on 7 September 2009. Two music videos were made, one directed by David O'Reilly, and one by Alex Courtes. The song is currently at #32 on the UK Singles Chart and at #7 on the Irish Singles Chart.\n\nThe first music video received its world premiere on 17 July 2009 through U2'schannel. Directed by David O'Reilly and designed by Jon Klassen, it is the band's first animated music video since 1995's &quot;Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, and is one of the few not to feature the band. It depicts several people in a city undergoing hardships, and the events that interconnect them and bring them happiness as they decide to make changes in their lives. The video was entered in the 2009 Ottawa International Animation Festival.\n\nThe second music video was directed by Alex Courtes and produced by Malachy Mcanenny. While the O'Reilly video plays over the studio version of the song, the Courtes version is the single edit. It consists of a live performance taken from the U2 360Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° Tour, filmed at Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain, on 2 July 2009.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nVideo\n-----\nDVD Rip from the official music video 'U2 - I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight'...\n\n\nVideo Format     - AVI (container) / XviD (codec)\nVideo Quality    - ~2100kbps\nVideo Resolution - 1008 x 576\nFrame Rate       - 30 fps\n   \nSound Quality    - 192kbps\nSound Channels   - 2 (stereo)\n\n\nSeed, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e27d86998f3f3c5a84daf866829016bc30bb0413","amp;dn":"U2+-+%5C%22Go+Crazy%5C%22+%5B2009%5D%5BGOLDFiSH_XviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e27d86998f3f3c5a84daf866829016bc30bb0413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,125,134,153,143,63,60,90,132,218,248,102,130,144,22,188,48,187,4,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
