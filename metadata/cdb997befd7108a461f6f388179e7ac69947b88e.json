Keiichi also demonstrates his skill in a variety of cars, including, the AE86 Trueno (Toyota Corolla GT-S), the S13 Silvia (Nissan first-generation 240SX), the S14 Silvia (Nissan second-generation 240SX), and an SW20 (Toyota first-generation MR2). Afterwards, Best Motoring International adds in a 10-minute video of footage from the 2003 SEMA show. An invaluable tool to anyone who is interested in the growing automotive trend of drifting.
