It was Hungary's submission to the 79th Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee.\n\n  ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s Hajdu  ...

Hungarian writer-director Szabolcs Hajdu's third feature stars his brother, ZoltÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s Hajdu, as a grown-up mat prodigy who arrives in Calgary circa 2001 to coach a junior team. Literally beaten down during his Communist-era childhood by the most abusive training mentor since Full Metal Jacket's R. Lee Ermey, MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s repeats history by smacking one of his kids. With his coaching duties stripped, MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s is demoted to babysitting a rebellious teen talent (Olympic medalist Kyle Shewfelt, his real-life protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©). Their lightweight clash seems instantly reparable the moment they learn to communicate through their athletic feats, though helmer Hajdu understands these dramatic limitationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, more importantly, the danger of using Olympians as thespians beyond the occasional poetry-in-motion tableau, framed from afar. \n\nThe bulk of White PalmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the more riveting, grim storylineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is seen in flashback to the early 1980s, as tween MiklÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s lives like his parents' show pony in an anxiety nightmare of nonstop humiliation, heightened here through haunting soundscapes. When the third act catches up to modern day with the inevitable arena competition, the teacher now faces both his student and his younger self, with the film cross-cutting between two white-knuckle climaxes, dismounting with an out-of-left-field Cirque du Soleil performance.\n\nWhite Palms is carefully edited to juxtapose more than one edge-of-the-seat moment. Tension is skilfully built into a story that is part documentary, part drama, and casting real gymnasts adds to the feeling of authenticity. Stark contrasts in the use of colour emphasise isolation - cold bluish tones for the scenes in Hungary are punctuated only with the bright red of the girls' outfits (in a sectioned-off area of the gym). Before going to Canada, Dongo's only venture into the latter world of brightness is when he is humiliatingly punished, providing a spectacle for the girls. The soundtrack has some haunting songs, although I felt the opening music was off-key - possibly intentionally - which I found a bit off-putting.\n\nWhite Palms brings some emotion-laden content to a fairly dry subject, as well as providing useful contrasts between the former Soviet bloc and the modern Western way of thinking. It might not make the mainstream market, but is a very watchable contribution from Eastern European cinema.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a6890a175eec024f4d0f4b8bb21b998ef26165","amp;dn":"Feher+tenyer+%28eng+subs%29+%5B2006%5D+Szabolcs+Hajdu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a6890a175eec024f4d0f4b8bb21b998ef26165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,166,137,10,23,94,236,2,79,77,15,75,139,178,27,153,142,242,97,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
