Unloved. He has no family. Not only does he need to deal with things like pondering suicide and questioning his sexual identity, but on top of that he's got these emo super powers that only seem to bring destruction and disaster, causing everyone to hate him more than they already do. His first love suffers a head explosion, the football team wants him dead, and he got an F in English. No wonder he's so depressed! \n\nWritten and illustrated by Steve Emond.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc31eef81ed3c7eafbddedab2e76fad7c29d07af","amp;dn":"Emo+Boy+%28SLG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc31eef81ed3c7eafbddedab2e76fad7c29d07af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,49,238,248,30,211,199,234,251,221,237,171,46,118,250,215,194,157,7,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
