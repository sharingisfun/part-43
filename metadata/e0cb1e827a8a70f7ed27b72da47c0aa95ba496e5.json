What is x264 \n\n\nx264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!\n\n02. What is a .mkv file \n\n\nMKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard AudioVideo container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0cb1e827a8a70f7ed27b72da47c0aa95ba496e5","amp;dn":"The+Green+Hornet+%282011%29+BRRip+720p+x264+MKV+by+RiddlerA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0cb1e827a8a70f7ed27b72da47c0aa95ba496e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,203,30,130,122,138,112,247,237,39,183,45,164,124,10,169,91,164,150,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
