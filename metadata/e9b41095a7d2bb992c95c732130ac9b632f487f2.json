From version 9.5, Directory Opus now supports the new Microsoft Windows Operating Systems.\n    *\n\n      Windows 7 &amp; Vista UAC Support: Vista/Windows 7 contain a protective layer of routines known as UAC which prevents unauthorized access to parts of your system. Opus fully supports the Microsoft methods for accessing this system. For example, Opus will display the UAC prompt in most situations when it is required. UAC support in Opus has improved over that offered in Windows Explorer. For example, in Explorer if you create a new folder in a protected location (like Program Files), and then rename the newly created folder, you will get four separate confirmation dialogs. In Opus, you will just get one!\n    *\n\n      New Explorer Replacement Functionality for Windows 7, Vista and XP:\n      In order to support Explorer Replacement under Windows7/Vista it has been necessary to change the way this mode is implemented. Now when Explorer Replacement mode is enabled double-clicking on a folder in ANY Explorer window will have the effect of opening in Opus. Previously, double-clicks only opened in Opus from the desktop. If you already had an Explorer window open and double-clicked on a folder in there it would read into the existing Explorer.\n    *\n\n      New XML-based Configuration: In Directory Opus 8, most configuration information was kept in the registry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ only Toolbars and some other settings were stored on disk. In Directory Opus 9, all configuration is now stored on disk in XML format.\n    *\n\n      New Configuration Backup &amp; Restore System:\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full Backup &amp; Restore configuration allows you to move configurations between machines easily.\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Export to USB Flash Drive: Opus 9 takes advantage of the disk-based nature of the new Opus configuration system and allows you to export your Directory Opus installation (including program, certificate and configuration) to a USB flash drive. The program will then run as a self-contained entity from this flash drive on another system, without modifying the registry or hard drive of the host. If you select a U3 drive, Opus will be exported as a U3 package and can be installed using the U3 LaunchPad software. If you select the standard USB device icon, Opus will be exported directly to the drive in non-U3 mode.\n    *\n\n      New Sub-Collections: The File Collections system now supports sub-collections (that is, collections within collections). Creating a sub-collection is straight-forward ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ simply use the CreateFolder command to create a folder inside an existing collection. You can move files and folders between collections and sub-collections as normal. Sub-collections behave exactly like collections.\n    *\n\n      New Breadcrumbs-style Location Field: A new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbreadcrumbsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-style Path field is available in the commands list in Customize as Path Field (Breadcrumbs). It provides a hierarchical view of the current path where each element in the path is a button that can be clicked to go immediately to that level of the path. Files can also be dropped on the elements. The arrows following each path element can also be clicked to display a popup menu of the contents of that folder.\n    *\n\n      New ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Find-As-You-TypeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Field: Opus has a new special &quot;find-as-you-type&quot; field in Listers and in the text viewer. It is similar to the one in Firefox and can be controlled by an option in Preferences. When you begin typing in a Lister a search box now appears at the bottom showing you what you are searching for. Scrolling to the item in the Lister still happens as before - the method is the same, only the interface has changed. The search field turns red if there is no match.\n    *\n\n      New Custom List View Code + Tiles Mode: Directory Opus 9 replaces the old system with a new custom icon display. The four traditional icon modes are all still present, and for the most part should be indistinguishable from the previous version. However, the annoying issues with the old icon modes are gone and the performance of the new code is significantly improved.\n      The scrolling of Listers has also been improved greatly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ scrolling with the mouse wheel is now accelerated, and details/power mode now have smooth scrolling which greatly enhances the effect of scrolling through Listers.\n      The custom list view code has also made possible the addition of a Tiles Mode. This is similar to the mode introduced in Explorer in Windows XP, but with a number of options not offered in Explorer.\n      From Preferences you can configure the Tiles display completely. The size and spacing can be altered; the frames and background color of individual tiles (turn off frames and the background color altogether to emulate the look of tiles mode in Explorer); choose whether or not thumbnails are shown in Tiles mode; configure the information displayed beneath the filename on a per-file type basis through the File Types system.\n    *\n\n      New Advanced Rename Enhancements: The Advanced Rename dialog has had a number of improvements, the most noticeable is the addition of a Script mode.\n    *\n\n      New Preferences Editor Improvements: Significant improvements based on user feedback include replacing the old List/Tabs interface by a new Tree view making it much easier to see which pages are available. At the bottom of the Preferences dialog there is a new Filter field. This lets you search for Preferences items matching a specified string, making it much easier to locate items than before. While many of the Preferences pages are similar to those from Opus 8, there have been a large number of changes and improvements made. Many dialogs use a new toolbar-style button system for easier control to Add/Delete/Edit items. Overall the Preferences system is more logically laid-out and easier to use for both new and old users.\n    *\n\n      Removal of Layout section in Preferences: The old Layout sections in Preferences was the cause of some confusion and has been removed. Instead, now there is just the Default Lister concept. This concept existed in Opus 8 but it was always confused with the options in Preferences.\n    *\n\n      New Customize Editor Improvements: The Customize dialog has been improved and includes a menu bar, the contents of which change depending on the current tab. In the Commands tab the menu contains Export and Import commands when the User command category is selected, providing a simple way of sharing User commands with others.\n    *\n\n      New FTP Address book: The FTP section of Preferences has been split out into a separate dialog with a menu to make configuring the address book easier. The menu also contains Import &amp; Export commands.\n    *\n\n      New FlickrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Synchronization: Opus now includes a Flickr Synchronization tool that makes it easy to keep your local photo collection in sync with your Flickr account. Flickr Synchronization is based upon File Collections (this is one of the main uses for the new sub-collection ability).\n    *\n\n      New ImageShackÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Image Upload: Directory Opus now features a built-in ImageShack upload utility. ImageShack is an image hosting service that (with some obvious exceptions) lets you upload and host any image for free.\n    *\n\n      New Command Parser Improvements: The command parser in Opus has been significantly improved. Perhaps the biggest change is that all the control sequences (like {file} etc) can now be used with the internal command set, without resorting to DOpusRT tricks. There are also a number of new control sequences.\n    *\n\n      New Custom Toolbar Icon Sets: Opus now allows you to use different icon sets. A new Preferences section in Display - Toolbar Icons allows you to import and choose which sets to use in a hierarchical fashion.\n    *\n\n      New Support for Links/Junctions: Opus now includes support for links/junctions. The Type column will display the type of link and the Description column will now show the target of junctions (and soft-links under Vista) as it does for shortcuts. The file functions know about junctions too - for example, Delete will not recurse into a junction or link to delete the contents, but instead will just delete the junction. GetSizes doesn't include the size of linked folders in its calculations, etc.\n    *\n\n      Plus many many changes and improvements in performance and functionality. \n\nBugs fixed / minor changes:\n\n    * Support for Explorer Replacement mode in Windows 7. Also fixed creation of soft-links in Windows 7.\n    * FTP re-upload changed files option now works with programs launched from buttons.\n    * The Print Folder function can now print meta-data (e.g. Author, Title, Artist, etc) columns in File Collections.\n    * Improved handling of Office safe-saves for files within collections.\n    * Text pasted into the Create Folder dialog is now stripped of any linefeeds.\n    * Fixed rendering problem with List Mode when font size meant the label text was smaller vertically than the icon.\n    * Zip auto-extract now sets the correct current directory for files that are in sub-folders of the zip file.\n    * Fixed sorting with Name column when file extension is hidden (previously the extension was still considered for the sort).\n    * Image ADDSUFFIX now works correctly when the filename has a dot in the name.\n    * Blank links in multi-line commands no longer cause some functions to misbehave.\n    * The {filepath} command code no longer incorrectly adds a  to the end of RAR file paths.\n    * Fixed problem with space/quote handling with the {allfilepath} command code.\n    * Fixed drag &amp; drop problems when dragging from/to FTP -- now correctly uses functions defined in File Types.\n    * Fixed problem that could cause infinite loop of listers/tabs to be opened when a path like C://Dir was entered.\n    * Fixed problem with drag &amp; drop that could prevent listers from coming to the front correctly.\n    * Fixed problem when dragging images from Firefox 3.5 to a lister (now writes the original image file instead of a bitmap version).\n    * With full-row selection on for the Folder Tree, double-clicks to expand/contract a branch are now active anywhere on the row instead of just on the label.\n    * Drag &amp; drop from FTP/SFTP to the desktop now works correctly instead of only copying 4K of the file.\n    * Added @sync to the drop-down list in the Advanced function editor.\n    * Fixed potential infinite loop in the FTP file properties dialog if an error message appeared and the dialog was closed before the error dialog was.\n    * Fixed a crash on startup that could occur if any environment variables contained %%.\n    * Fixed a crash that could occur in the Licence Manager on x64 systems.\n    * FTP Interim support for VMS servers.\n    * File permissions are now updated correctly when undeleting a file from the recycle bin (prevents files appearing with a 'padlock' icon overlay in Windows 7).\n    * The Delete confirmation dialog (and other dialogs where appropriate) now respond to the 'Y' and 'N' keys as well as the existing accelerators for each button. ('Y' and 'N' are localised as appropriate.)\n    * The Find Panel now correctly inherits the current path when a new lister is opened.\n    * Ctrl-Z to undo a Paste now works in inline rename.\n    * Moving a file in a File Collection to a folder on the same hard drive now correctly moves the file instead of using copy/delete semantics.\n    * Fixed problem which meant that, in rare circumstances, files within archives were not fully read by viewer plugins.\n    * Fix for possible memory corruption with glass docked toolbars in Office style.\n    * Fixed incorrect sort order in Profile branch of tree in Windows 7.\n    * The 'Open With' menu item is no longer added for .EXE and other program files (same as Explorer).\n    * FTP improvements: Increased upload speed for both standard FTP and SSH.\n    * Fixed error that could allow a Copy/Move to take place with no valid destination path (e.g. if My Computer was open in the destination file display).\n    * Folder colors, toolbar icons and status bar icons now support aliases/environment variables.\n    * Added /homeroot alias for root of program drive.\n    * Folder aliases are now sorted correctly when displayed in the tree.\n    * For DOS commands with @leavedoswindowopen set (which includes commands run from the FAYT field), Opus now only adds /K to the command line if the command processor is the default cmd.exe; if the %ComSpec% environment variable is set to something else, Opus will now look for a new environment variable called %ComSpecLeaveOpenArg% which can be used to specify an argument for the &quot;leave open&quot; option.\n    * Fixed problem where a checkmark next to a context menu item may not have been shown (for example, the Always available offline context menu command).\n    * Additional fixes for rendering of glass docked toolbars.\n    * Buttons on &quot;taskbar&quot; and &quot;borderless&quot; toolbars docked to the right edge of the screen can now be clicked when the mouse is right at the edge of the screen.\n    * Fixed crash when attempting to view some 16-bit Photoshop images.\n\nActiveX plugin improvements:\n\n    * Added workaround for &quot;Adobe PDF for Vista&quot; preview handler not working under x64 due to Adobe registering it incorrectly.\n    * Added workaround for &quot;Adobe PDF for Vista&quot; preview handler rendering blank pages sometimes when scrolled with the mouse wheel.\n    * &quot;Adobe PDF for Vista&quot; preview handler is now enabled by default, if installed, as it's the only Adobe PDF viewer applet that works properly on Windows 7 x64 and it doesn't depend on the &quot;Display PDF in browser&quot; setting of Adobe Reader. People who preferred Adobe Reader can still configure the plugin to use it instead of the Adobe PDF preview handler if they want to.\n    * Added .MP4 to default Generic ActiveX extensions.\n    * Added workaround for Microsoft preview handlers that have identical names. It's now clear which is which.\n    * Added a hardcoded list of default preview handler associations to use as a fallback when no association exists in the registry. (Example 1: Uninstalling the FoxIt preview handler does not re-assign .PDF to the Adobe preview handler. Example 2: On a vanilla Windows 7 install there is no .EML filetype but there is an Email preview handler which works fine if the plugin knows to use it.)\n    * Plugin configuration dialog now opens a bit faster on Windows 7 x64.\n    * Fixed using Microsoft Office itself (not the preview handlers) to view documents on Windows 7 x64.\n    * The Open Office file types are now viewed via an embedded Internet Explorer, by default, as this works better with OpenOffice 3.\n    * The default configuration now recognises Open Office documents (.ODT), spreadsheets (.ODS), graphics (.ODG) and presentations (.ODP).\n    * Internet Explorer and the Windows Email preview handlers can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel without first clicking on them. (Unfortunately, this has to be done by giving them the focus when you scroll.)\n    * Adobe PDF preview handler no longer takes the focus when scrolling with the mouse wheel.\n    * Added workaround for Adobe PDF preview handler on Vista x64. (Different to the previous workaround for Windows 7 x64.)\n    * Added workaround for Adobe PDF preview handler locking files when they are viewed.\n    * Added workaround for Adobe PDF preview handler not responding to the keyboard after scrolling with the mouse wheel.\n    * Added workaround for Adobe PDF preview handler not allowing you to tab-cycle to or from it.\n    * Added workaround for Adobe PDF preview handler not drawing pages if you scrolled rapidly using the keyboard.\n    * Note: The above two Adobe PDF workarounds are done by installing a keyboard hook into the Adobe PDF viewer process. When you view a PDF file, if your anti-virus software complains that docsvw32.exe (part of the Opus ActiveX plugin) looks like a keylogger then you should either dismiss the ignore the warning or disable the keyboard hook by setting KeyHooks=&quot;no&quot; in the plugin's configuration file. A FAQ has been posted with more details: Opus executables and hooks.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9b41095a7d2bb992c95c732130ac9b632f487f2","amp;dn":"Directory+Opus+9.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9b41095a7d2bb992c95c732130ac9b632f487f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,180,16,149,167,210,187,153,44,149,199,50,19,10,201,182,50,244,135,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
