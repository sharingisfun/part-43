Young's body of work ranks second only to Bob Dylan in terms of depth, and he was able to sustain his critical reputation, as well as record sales, for a longer period of time than Dylan, partially because of his willfully perverse work ethic. From the beginning of his solo career in the late '60s through into the 21st century, he never stopped writing, recording, and performing; his official catalog only represented a portion of his work, since he kept countless tapes of unreleased songs in his vaults.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tReprise\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Good To See You\n02.Silver &amp; Gold\n03.Daddy Went Walkin'\n04.Buffalo Springfield Again\n05.The Great Divide\n06.Horseshoe Man\n07.Red Sun\n08.Distant Camera\n09.Razor Love\n10.Without Rings\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b460aa62b78a3a20ebddc8492b3c2c0c0164c7","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+-+Silver+%26+Gold+%282000%29+CD+Rip++320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5b460aa62b78a3a20ebddc8492b3c2c0c0164c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,180,96,170,98,183,138,58,32,235,221,200,73,43,60,44,12,1,100,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
