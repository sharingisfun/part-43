It provides ideas to spark your love life up a little (or a lot), and make you more attractive to others, more interesting and more able to sense attraction with others.\n\nOf course you could achieve the same result by getting out, socialising, learning more interesting things (read widely - dont just watch TV), learning to do more things, pay more attention to other people (really LISTEN to them), give people genuine compliments, be polite, be helpful , and be confident that you really are a good person. But then, if you had all this, you wouldn't need to read (listen) to this would you?\n\nPDF copy also included.\n\nAll MP3 files encoded at 128kbps, reconverted from a FLAC file version so more of you can listen to it. \n\nGood luck and have fun. \n\nYou wonderful person you! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:522b06432f71cf07d8f084ac491270466163a23d","amp;dn":"AudioBook+-+Paul+Scheele+-+Creating+Sparks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"522b06432f71cf07d8f084ac491270466163a23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,43,6,67,47,113,207,7,216,240,132,172,73,18,112,70,97,99,162,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
