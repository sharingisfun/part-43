In fact, she warns that doing so could cost you time and money, and even worse, land you in a courtroom. In this handy little guidebook, Clifford breaks down the essentials of the interview, a pivotal aspect of the selection process. She succinctly details the process from composing the best set of questions and handling different types of interview conditions to making a job offer (or deciding not to). Clifford identifies common pitfalls, particularly lack of objectivity. \n\nShe summarizes each chapter and provides links to related Web sites. However, for a book devoted to interviewing, it is strangely shy of a softer, human element. Still, it is, by and large, both practical and solid. getAbstract thinks you'll find this quick, instructive manual very useful as a short course on the art of the interview.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa00a1c443d7318edca1711ebc46ccc0fe0fc42","amp;dn":"Interview+Others-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa00a1c443d7318edca1711ebc46ccc0fe0fc42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,160,10,28,68,61,115,24,237,202,23,17,235,196,108,204,15,224,252,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
