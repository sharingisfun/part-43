It's       \n    soon clear that the gun emplacements are part of a much   \n    bigger, complex fortified settlement that was home to    \n    hundreds of German soldiers equipped with a vast array    \n    of weapons.                                                \n                                                              \n    And, unlike with older sites, the Team can talk to       \n    people who witnessed life under the occupation at first   \n    hand.                                                      \n                                                              \n    What emerges is the shocking story of a fortress island  \n    where German installations were built by slave labour     \n    and the local population began to starve as the war        \n    continued. Of terrible conditions that seem more          \n    fitting to the eras the Team usually investigate,        \n    rather than just 70 years ago.                            \n                                                               \n    Over three days Time Team uncover a fascinating and       \n    frequently horrifying glimpse of life during war.        \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:895e83a146c3bde80d7d0b71f72353586ce0402d","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S18E04.HDTV.XviD-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"895e83a146c3bde80d7d0b71f72353586ce0402d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,94,131,161,70,195,189,232,13,125,11,113,247,35,83,88,108,224,64,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
