His best-known compositions include &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;, &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;, &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; and &quot;Johnny Strikes Up The Band&quot;, all of which are featured on his 1978 sophomore release, Excitable Boy. Other well-known songs written by Zevon have been recorded by other artists, including &quot;Poor Poor Pitiful Me&quot; (a top 40 hit by Linda Ronstadt), &quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot;, &quot;Mohammed's Radio&quot;, &quot;Carmelita&quot;, and &quot;Hasten Down the Wind&quot;.\n\nAlong with his own compositions, Zevon recorded or performed occasional covers, including Bob Dylan's &quot;Knockin' on Heaven's Door&quot; and Leonard Cohen's &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;. He was a frequent guest on Late Night with David Letterman and the Late Show with David Letterman. Letterman later performed guest vocals on &quot;Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)&quot; with Paul Shaffer and members of the CBS Orchestra.\n\n\n\nExcitable Boy is the third album by Warren Zevon, released in 1978. It includes the top 40 success &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;. The album brought Warren to commercial attention and remains the best-selling album of his career. A remastered and expanded edition was released during 2007.\n\nThe album includes several songs that use macabre humor (&quot;Excitable Boy,&quot; &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;), as well as some songs that take place in locales outside the United States, (&quot;Veracruz&quot;), and two songs that both use macabre humor and take place in countries other than the U.S.A. (&quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot;, &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;). In addition, there are two straightforward ballads about life and relationships (&quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot; and &quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot;).\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nWarren Zevon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, synthesizer, bass, guitar, piano, keyboards, Vocals\nJorge CalderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony vocals, Spanish vocals on &quot;Veracruz&quot;\nDanny &quot;Kootch&quot; Kortchmar - guitar, percussion\nRuss Kunkel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nKarla Bonoff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony vocals on &quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot;\nJackson Browne ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals, harmony vocals\nLuis Damian ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ jarana on &quot;Veracruz&quot;\nKenny Edwards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, harmony vocals\nMick Fleetwood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums on &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;\nThe Gentlemen Boys ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\nArthur Gerst ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harp, Mexican harp\nBob Glaub ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJim Horn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ recorder, saxophone\nGreg Ladanyi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bells\nRick Marotta ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nJohn McVie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass on &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;\nJeff Porcaro ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ percussion, drums on &quot;Nighttime in the Switching Yard&quot;\nLinda Ronstadt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, harmony on &quot;Excitable Boy&quot;\nLeland Sklar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\nJ.D.
