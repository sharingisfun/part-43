Layers of \nvolcanic ash were detected by Lidar and probed in-situ with aerosol instruments. \nUnder suitable viewing conditions, the ash layer was visible as a brownish layer to \nthe observer. The horizontal and vertical distributions of the volcano layers were \nvariable. In the plume layers particles larger than 3Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµm were detected at \nconcentrations, not present in the free troposphere during unpolluted conditions. The \nconcentrations of large particles measured in the volcano layers are comparable to \nconcentrations measured typically in Saharan dust plumes but smaller compared to \nparticle concentrations in the polluted boundary layer. An estimation of the particle \nmass concentration in the volcanic ash plume probed as part of a vertical profile over \nLeipzig at about 4 km altitude yield 60 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âµg/m3.     \n      \nAfter the flight the Falcon was inspected. So far no damages were observed including \nengines (after boroscopy) and windows. Further engine inspection is ongoing. Silver \nfoils attached to under-wing stations showed no visible impact from volcanic ash. \n\n\nComment: Finally some scientific facts in this ocean of confusion around the volcanic eruption in Iceland.\n\n\ntags: Falcon flight DLR volcano eruption Iceland volcanic ash EyjafjallajÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kull troposphere pollution airspace grounding particle 2010\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b4c06da0aafd70c4d1fb0cafaf15d234fdf7578","amp;dn":"Report+of+Falcon+Flight+19+April+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b4c06da0aafd70c4d1fb0cafaf15d234fdf7578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,76,6,218,10,175,215,12,77,31,176,202,250,241,93,35,79,223,117,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
