Due to busy schedules, band reunions and other circumstances this never happened and the idea was put on ice. \n\nA few years ago Thanatos played a show with the German band Death By Dawn, featuring one Martin van Drunen on vocals. After a few beers the aforementioned idea was brought up again and at the end of 2006 former Pestilence/Asphyx-singer Martin van Drunen, Gorefest-drummer Ed Warby, ex-Houwitser bass player Theo van Eekelen and both Thanatos-guitarists Paul Baayens and Stephan GebÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©di hooked up for a serious drinking session in the city of Amersfoort, Holland. A mutual love for old school death metal bands like Autopsy, Bolt Thrower, Massacre, Celtic Frost and Death resulted in the idea to form a band together.\n\nEasier said than done, cause the band membersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ other bands Asphyx, Thanatos and Gorefest are very active recording albums and playing loads of shows. \nNot to mention EdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s countless studio projects. Nevertheless, all five of us were very enthusiastic about the idea, and we started writing material for this new band.\n\nAnother problem was finding a suitable name for the band. It seems every possible name had already been taken by bands we never heard of and probably nobody will ever hear from again. After tons of ideas and suggestions we settled for Hail Of Bullets. The metal started flowing and within a couple of months we already had enough material written for a full length album.\n\nIn July 2007 the band decided to record four songs for a promo CD. Drums and vocals were recorded at the Excess studios in Rotterdam, Holland. Swedish death metal guru Dan SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ mixed the four songs at his Unisound Studios and the result turned out pretty monstrous. As SwanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ himself stated; ,,If this promo doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get you guys a good record deal, I will eat my laptop!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \nDan's stomach is still in good shape since Metal Blade Records didn't hesitate to sign the band. Our debut album '...Of Frost And War' was released in May 2008 and the reactions from both fans and press were quite overwhelming! \n\nIn the Summer of 2008 the band played a number of festival shows, including Party.San, Summer Breeze and Waldrock and in the Fall we started doing club shows all over Europe. More club shows and festivals are planned for 2009 and at the end of this year the band will start working on their second album...\n\nCurrent line-up \nMartin van Drunen - Vocals (Pestilence (Hol), Bunkur, Submission (Hol), Bolt Thrower, Comecon, Death by Dawn, Mortuary I.O.D., Asphyx (Hol))\nPaul Baayens - Guitar (Thanatos (Hol), Cremation (Hol), Asphyx (Hol))\nStephan Gebedi - Guitar (Thanatos (Hol), Legion, Second Hell)\nTheo van Eekelen - Bass (Judgement Day (Hol), Thanatos (Hol), Houwitser)\nEd Warby - Drums (Gorefest, Demiurg (Swe), Ayreon, Star One, Impact (Hol), Aggressor (Hol), Tempter (Hol), Valkyrie (Hol), Elegy (Hol), Orphanage, Lana Lane)\n\nGenre = Old School Death Metal\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = Vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n01.Warsaw Rising \n02.Liberators\n03.Destroyer \n04.Red Wolfs Of Stalin (Live) \n05.Nachthexen (Live) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9daf79dbcf0a38935037e81dbd157a3ec53203e","amp;dn":"Hail+Of+Bullets+-+Warsaw+Rising+%5Bep%5D+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9daf79dbcf0a38935037e81dbd157a3ec53203e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,218,247,157,188,240,163,137,53,3,126,129,219,209,87,163,236,83,32,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
