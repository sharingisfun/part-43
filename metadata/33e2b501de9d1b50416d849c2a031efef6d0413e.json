Also the fact that you can only download them separately, well, this includes both the XP AND Vista version.\n\n\nIf OPHcrack is not working, view the following link for a more detailed description: http://www.pastie.org/614838\n\nThis should help a lot if you are having troubles.\n\n[REMEMBER TO SEED]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33e2b501de9d1b50416d849c2a031efef6d0413e","amp;dn":"ophcrack+LiveCD+XP+and+Vista","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33e2b501de9d1b50416d849c2a031efef6d0413e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,226,181,1,222,157,27,80,65,109,132,156,42,3,30,254,246,208,65,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
