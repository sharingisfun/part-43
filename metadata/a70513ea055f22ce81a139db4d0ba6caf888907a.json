Ward made the\nobservational film In Spring One Plants Alone about Puhi's\nday-to-day life in the remote Urewera Ranges. By then almost\n80, she was obsessively caring for her schizophrenic adult son\nNiki, whose violent fits terrified her. In this new cinema\nfeature Ward sets out to unravel the mystery that has haunted\nhim for 30 years: Who was Puhi?\n\nAnd why was she so obsessed with this last remaining son?\n\nUsing his relationship with Puhi as the framework to explore\nher life, he finds a woman of extraordinary fortitude who, at\nthe age of 12, was chosen by the great Tuhoe prophet Rua\nKenana to marry his son, Whatu. Rua gave her the name, Puhi\n(&quot;special one&quot;). At 14, she had her first baby while hiding in\nthe bush, having escaped from the 1916 police raid on Rua's\ncommunity at Maungapohatu, where she witnessed the arrest of\nRua and Whatu and the killing of Toko, Rua's other son, said\nto be her lover\n\nShe would go on to have 13 more children. But by the time Ward\nmade his initial film, there were few signs of what had become\nof them. In Rain of the Children, he finds out how the loss of\nher children affected the course of her life. The tragedies\nshe lived through were so powerful that some, including her\nbelieved she was cursed\n\nAfter a tumultuous second marriage and the manslaughter of her\nthird husband, Puhi was left with her dependant son, Niki. She\ndedicated herself to this man-child, trying to protect him at\nall costs, even from beyond the grave\n\nRain of the Children is Ward's search for truth in the story\nof a woman who sought redemption through love and who has\nremained a touchstone for him throughout his life\n\nCAST\n\nHarmony Wihapi ....
