The troublesome potential of new technologies has brought questions into the public arena as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bef894db1091e74ea0795a64fb334657c996fedf","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Science+and+Religion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bef894db1091e74ea0795a64fb334657c996fedf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,248,148,219,16,145,231,78,160,121,90,100,251,51,70,87,201,150,254,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
