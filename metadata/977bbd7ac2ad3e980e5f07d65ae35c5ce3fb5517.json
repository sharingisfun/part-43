Not only allow my helicopters the users to fly around, but they also support air transport missions that are typical for this type of aircraft. The Sud Aviation SA315B Lama V4 for FS2004, an earlier add-on for Microsoft Flight-Simulator of mine, already supported such transport missions. Now, I am glad to present a new edition for the current FSX.\nThanks to the help of helicopter operators, pilots und engineers who gave me most useful hints about the helicopter, I finally was able to build this Lama. The Lama allows a helicopter experience coming as close to real life as possible. The given limits of Microsoft Flight Simulator ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ unfortunately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ make a 100% realistic rendition of a helicopter impossible at the present stage. However, I hope you will enjoy your flights in my Lama &quot;X&quot;!\nPeter Salzgeber\nThe Aircraft\n\nHighlights:\n39 versions / configurations\nPaints from 6 different operators\nRealistic sounds\nRealistic flight-dynamics\nOriginal start-up procedure\n3D Cockpit fully animated\nFSX DX10 programming\nModell variations:\nSummer and winther equipment\nWinch operations\nLong-line operations\nSpectroLab Night-Sun\nSpray equipment\nTransport versions with\n8 meter / 24 ft Sling\nMaterial transport\nBamby-Bucket (Fire-fighting)\n16 meter / 48 ft Sling\nLogging (wood)\nMobile-phone antenna\nShort-line rescue\nCow rescue &gt;\nincl. 6 Sling-load and rescue-training missions for Acceleration-Pack!\n\nSystem requirements\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator FSX\nMicrosoft Flight Simulator FS2004\nWindows XP/VISTA /Processor 2GHz\nRAM min. 1GB / Graphics min. 256 MB\n700 MB free disk space\nNew conception for FSX, Full FSX SP2 / Acceleration Pack and VISTA DirectX 10 compatible\n\nMore detailed aircraft models for different configurations:Passenger Lama with Mission-Equipment and Heli SkiingTransport Lama with different loads and Bamby-Bucket for Fire-fighting\nWinch Opreation Lama\nLong line Rescue Operation Lama\nSkids and Basket\nnew ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvent panel switchboardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with new switches for easier use.\nnew built, accurate rotor system with new detailed rotor heads (main and tail rotor)\nnew Gauges for more realism and better performance\nAlso included:\nLama Original Lama Flight Manual as PDF\n \nThe sceneries\nThe FSX version contains the air bases in Zermatt and Raron, the village of Zermatt, as well as the following mountain cabins: HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rnlihÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tte, SchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nbielhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tte, Monte-Rosa-HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tte, TopalihÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tte and HollandiahÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼tte.
