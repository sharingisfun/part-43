One of the best things about this book is the exercises - \nif you go through every one you will never be unclear on a property \nof a Radon measure or of Lebesgue integrable functions. If you're \nan applied mathematician this will be the last book on measure theory\nyou'll ever read or need. If you're a pure mathematician this is \nwhere you jump in - then try http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4894188/\n\nMYRIAD IS LOOKING FOR ANARCHISTS WORKING IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES\nor anyone else who can help pick, find, prepare and upload math warez\ncontact MYRIAD at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bdd0c4cfd4dcd9cadccfd8c7fddad2d2dad1d8d0dcd4d193ded2d0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\t\t\n\nTHANKS TO ALL WHO HAVE SEEDED THE MYRIAD UPLOADS.
