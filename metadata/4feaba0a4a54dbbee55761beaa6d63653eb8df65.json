No character development. No narration. Just beauty. Living Landscapes: The World's Most Beautiful Places immerses the viewer in the breathtaking visuals of nine regional locales that showcase the serene beauty often found in nature. Not to be confused with the narrative documentary style of the spectacular Planet Earth, Landscapes simply places the camera in gorgeous locations and allows the viewer to savor the sights and sounds at his own leisurely pace. While many will view this as nothing more than a showroom screensaver, I found it soothing and entrancing and thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nFormato MKV\nDurata 1h 19min\nDimensione 3.66 GiB\nVideo Codec x264\nRisoluzione 1280x688 pixels\nAspect Ratio 16/9\nFrame Rate 29.970 fps\nAudio Melodico, AC3 5.1 @ 448 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4feaba0a4a54dbbee55761beaa6d63653eb8df65","amp;dn":"%5BHD+-+720p%5D+Living+Landscapes+-+World%5C%27s+Most+Beautiful+Places","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4feaba0a4a54dbbee55761beaa6d63653eb8df65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,234,186,10,74,84,219,190,229,87,97,190,170,109,99,101,62,184,223,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
