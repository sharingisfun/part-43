He goes on the trail of\n      the extremely rare white spirit bear along Canada's beautiful\n      Northwest Pacific coast. Starting his search in the remote\n      Mussel Inlet, he encounters grizzly bears feeding on salmon\n      prior to hibernation. Realising that aggressive grizzly bears\n      guard the best feeding spots, he moves to a smaller inlet where\n      he believes evidence of black bears - which share a similar\n      habitat to the spirit bear - will lead him to his quarry.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
