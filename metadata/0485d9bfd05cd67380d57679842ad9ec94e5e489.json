He is a born storyteller who brings a positive, life-affirming message to his brilliant lyrical flow and compelling music.\n\nThere are no clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s in what Cudi does. He is a breath of fresh air - a dynamic and important new voice, not only in the next phase of hip-hop, but as a groundbreaking trendsetter who represents the future. I am thrilled to welcome Kid Cudi into the Universal Motown family.&quot;\n\nKid Cudi released his first mixtape, A Kid Named Cudi, in July, 2008 as a free download sponsored by New York streetwear company 10 Deep, leading to an introduction and signing to Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music imprint, and in turn, to Cudi's co-writing of four tracks on the platinum Kanye West album &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot;, including the Top 5 single, &quot;Heartless&quot; and stepping out in a featured vocal on &quot;Welcome to Heartbreak.&quot; He followed this up with his first Official single; &quot;Day 'n' Nite&quot; dominated with #1 rankings at multiple radio formats.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  In My Dreams [Cudder Anthem]\n02  Soundtrack 2 My Life\n03  Simple As...\n04  Solo Dolo [Nightmare]\n05  Heart Of A Lion [Kid Cudi Theme Music]\n06  My World [Ft.
