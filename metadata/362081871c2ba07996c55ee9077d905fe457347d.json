The album, which was recorded in the New Orleans French Quarter in September and October, features eight cover versions and four original new songs co-written by Marianne, four songs which feature the virtuoso guitar playing of John Porter, a musician/producer friend most noted for his work with Roxy Music, Eric Clapton and The Smiths.\n\nThe Hal Willner, produced album also includes one song with lyrics specially written for her by Irish playwright Frank McGuiness (the evocative ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Old HouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), two cameo appearances on guitar from another old friend, Lou Reed, plus further cameos from Dr. John and MC5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wayne Kramer.\n\nSpeaking about the album, Faithfull says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œConventional happiness isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t my way, you know. But this is a very happy record. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not depressed anymore. And I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all been well worth it. I did have a bit of a bad time in the 70s but I think things have been wonderful. So I suppose this album is a bit of a breakthrough. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m incredibly lucky, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know it. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m so grateful to be able to still write songs and express my emotion in music. And the best thing of all is working with such great people. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inspirational.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. The Stations\n02. Why did we have to part\n03.
