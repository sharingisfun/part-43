Fatale offers an experimental play experience that stimulates the imagination and encourages multiple interpretations and personal associations.\n\nFatale is played through first person 3D navigation but its controls were designed to minimize the risk of motion sickness. As a result, it may appear somewhat unconventional to the seasoned gamer.\n\n    Salome is a first century Judean princess mentioned in the Christian Bible by Matthew and by Mark. But it is Oscar Wilde's 19th century play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSalomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that really inspired Fatale. In the Bible, Salome is a child who dances for King Herod and asks the head of John the Baptist as a reward. In Wilde's version, Salome falls in love with the prophet. He rejects her and she has him executed. The play ends with her kissing the lips of his decapitated head.\n\n    Most of Fatale takes place in the aftermath of this event, when all has turned quiet and the moon brings comfort to troubled hearts. \n\n\nif you like the game, buy it! its only $7!!\n\n\nwebsite - http://tale-of-tales.com/Fatale/\n\n\n100% clean and working!\n\nplease help seed for as long as you can!\n\nany and all comments are welcome!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae2eabc9bc36447e6f4d00a59d613ad1f220307","amp;dn":"tale+of+tales+-+FATALE+-repack-%5Bwetwilly+%3DP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae2eabc9bc36447e6f4d00a59d613ad1f220307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,226,234,188,155,195,100,71,230,244,208,10,89,214,19,173,31,34,3,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
