Most of the special moves no longer use touch screen in order to be performed. Touch screen controls perform certain Jutsu. New characters include TS Sasuke and Sai. The online-play has been removed, although there is a High Score mode available. There are also side-missions which can be completed to unlock more characters. Despite the features this game dicarded from the series, it's still a solid game that can hold up a long amount of hours. It was released in North America under the title of &quot;Naruto Shippuden: Naruto vs. Sasuke&quot;.The Playable characters are Naruto (3 Tailed and 4 Tailed), Sakura, Sai, Yamato, Kakashi, Jiraiya, Sasuke, Rock Lee, Shikamaru, Neji, Kiba, Ino, Hinata, and Shino. Unlike previous games, villains are unplayable.\n\nNFO description not posted here due to it being expletive-laden, more so than the usual scene drama.
