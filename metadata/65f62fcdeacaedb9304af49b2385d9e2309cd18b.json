It was also their last original work for nine years. The band announced their break-up in June 1979 during the making of the album, and a fortnight later the band's founder and guiding light Lowell George died from a heart attack brought on by years of overindulgence. Feat would reform in 1988.\nThe cover shows one of Neon Park's several duck-girls - an allusion to &quot;The Finishing Touch&quot; by painter Gil Elvgren.\n\n\n&quot;Down on the Farm&quot; was the last album to feature leadsinger, guitarist and songwriter Lowell George. Actually George had left the band before the album was finished, and sadly during a solo tour in 1979 he died from a heart-attack. George had always been the driving force in the band, but due to healthproblems ( drugs/alcohol) his position in the band had diminished after &quot;Feats Don't Fail Me Now&quot;. \n\nThe previous album &quot;Time Loves a Hero&quot; had very little input from George and their musical style had become much more slick and and funky. \n\nAfter George's death the other bandmembers decided to finish the album they had been working on before George left. Fortunately George had recorded vocals for most of the tracks, and he wrote 5 of the songs on the album. The album is often referred to as one of the weaker albums from the George era, a fact I never understood. It's no exaggeration that it's one my personal favourites. \n\nGeorge's vocals were never better and his songs are outstanding. &quot;Be One Now&quot; is simply heartbreaking. &quot;Kokomo&quot; and &quot;Six Feet of Snow&quot; are as good as anything on &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; or &quot;Feats&quot;. The title track written by Barrere is catchy and funky and featuring one his strongest vocal performances - I used to believe it was George singing. \n\nAmong the rest of the album's tracks &quot;Straight From the Heart&quot;, written by George and Payne also deserves to be brought out. \n\nThe final two tracks could be the reason that the album as a whole is often underrated. They are nice tracks; a little too polished for my taste, with very litle, if any, input from George. Still a great album.
