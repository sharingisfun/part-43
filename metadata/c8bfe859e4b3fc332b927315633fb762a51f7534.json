Ok, let's go:\n\n1.Install the game with SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso to the Installer's default destination. \n2.Apply the cracks (just copy the whole content from SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso\\SKIDROW folder to installation folder). \n3.Copy Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK into the installation folder. \n4.Find ModBuddy folder in Sid Meier's Civilization V SDK folder and run Modbuddy.updater.exe and specify your install path, then specify the user path which should be located under C:\\Users\\UserName\\Documents\\My Games\\Sid Meier's Civilization 5. \n5.Apply SKIDROW Update 7 (you can find it in torrent sites). \n6.Apply the cracks in SKIDROW's Update 7\\SKIDROW folder coming with the torrent (just copy the content to installation folder).\nAfter this step if you try to run World Builder you will receive the errors. So here is the magical step. \n7.First backup these three files to elsewhere (for ex. Desktop): \n\nCivilizationV.exe\nCvGameCoreDLLFinal Release.dll\nCvGameDatabaseWin32Final Release.dll\nCvLocalizationWin32Final Release.dll\n\n\nThen copy only the listed files from SKIDROW's sr-civ5.iso\\SKIDROW folder to the installation folder:\n\nCivilizationV.exe\nCvGameCoreDLLFinal Release.dll\nCvGameDatabaseWin32Final Release.dll\nCvLocalizationWin32Final Release.dll\n\n\nTa taaa.... Run World Builder. Do what ever you want!!! \nBut, now, we have the wrong version of executable and other core 'dll's??? \nRestore the files backed-up in step 7 to installation folder to able to run the game properly. \n\nDON'T FORGET! WORLD BUILDER WON'T WORK AFTER APPLYING THE PROPER UPDATE CRACKS!\n\nIf you like you can apply Pandora Update after creating the desired MOD or MAP.\n\nHave a nice day. by Flashbond \n\n(this isnt my creation, but it surely works ^^ thanks to Flashbond!!) \n\nThe Civilization Sdk is added with this torrent. \n\nEnjoy Guys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8bfe859e4b3fc332b927315633fb762a51f7534","amp;dn":"Sid.Meiers.Civilization.V.Update.7-SKIDROW++worldbuider+work-aro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8bfe859e4b3fc332b927315633fb762a51f7534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,191,232,89,228,179,252,51,43,146,115,21,99,63,183,98,165,31,117,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
