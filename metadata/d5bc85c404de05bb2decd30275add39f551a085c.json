After drug problems and internal dissension nearly destroyed the group, Aerosmith mounted a spectacular comeback in the 1980s. Despite a considerably more commercially slick and power-ballad oriented sound than theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d first emerged with, frequently drawing on outside songwriters, they managed to became even more popular the second time around.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\n\nWith 1987's Permanent Vacation successfully restoring Aerosmith's reputation as one of hard rock's finest, Columbia Records (their first record company) decided the time was right to issue a follow-up of sorts to their 1980 compilation, Greatest Hits. The result, 1988's Gems, features almost all the tracks that were missing from the first collection, focusing more on their harder-rocking album cuts instead of the hits. Such favorites as their superb cover of &quot;Train Kept a Rollin'&quot; (a perennial concert showstopper) and the early classic &quot;Mama Kin&quot; are included, as well as tracks unfamiliar to the casual fan. Three selections are featured from their definitive album, Rocks (&quot;Rats in the Cellar,&quot; &quot;Lick and a Promise,&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fault&quot;), plus other '70s highlights: &quot;No Surprize,&quot; &quot;Adam's Apple,&quot; &quot;Round and Round,&quot; &quot;Critical Mass,&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Thighs.&quot; And a previously unreleased studio version of &quot;Chip Away the Stone&quot; will undoubtedly interest hardcore fans (only a live version from Live Bootleg had been issued before). Like the Stones and Zeppelin, Aerosmith's album cuts often eclipsed their more renowned material, making Gems an indispensable collection. \n\n\n01.Rats In The Cellar\n02.Lick And A Promise\n03.Chip Away The Stone\n04.No Surprize\n05.Mama Kin\n06.Adam's Apple\n07.Nobody's Fault\n08.Round And Round\n09.Critical Mass\n10.Lord Of The Thighs\n11.Jailbait\n12.Train Kept A Rollin'\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5bc85c404de05bb2decd30275add39f551a085c","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Gems+%2ARemaster%2A+%281988%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5bc85c404de05bb2decd30275add39f551a085c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,188,133,196,4,222,5,187,45,236,211,2,117,173,211,159,85,26,8,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
