Also standard is a plethora of additional enrichment content such as activities and time lines. In AÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Z format, the set provides more than 300 entries for five content areas: characters, deities, myths, themes, and cultures.\n\nThis five-volume set brings clarity out of confusion for the middle and high school student studying world mythology. The 300 A-to-Z entries from 40-plus cultures are grouped into five categories (character, deity, myth, theme, and culture) and come with a reader's guide that explores major themes in world mythology. Written clearly and concisely through the lens of world culture and integrating a multidisciplinary and cross-cultural view, the set has a distinct freshness and succinctness, yet it provides rubrics for comparison across entries. When shaped in the context of culture and societal norms, mythology functions as a mirror, which imitates the world from which it is derived. Therefore, topics covering values, geographic location, natural resources, technological state, and social organization shape the subjects in overarching themes congruent with a worldview. BOTTOM LINE A wonderful source serving the needs of middle or high schools whether part of a public, school, or general library collection, this work is even more comprehensive than the recently revised Facts On File Encyclopedia of World Mythology and Legend (see the review, p. 100) and more in-depth than UXL's two-volume Junior Worldmark Encyclopedia of World Cultures (1999)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:264ab2f5c14be3a5afa6985d4d3ec8a147d118bb","amp;dn":"U+X+L+Encyclopedia+of+World+Mythology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"264ab2f5c14be3a5afa6985d4d3ec8a147d118bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,74,178,245,193,75,227,165,175,166,152,93,77,62,200,161,71,209,24,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
