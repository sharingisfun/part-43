This will allow it to work on your PC running Windows XP.\n\nMy previous upload only contained an extension of the drivers, which is why it wouldn't work.\n\nSo here it is. Just run the executable and install it. Sorry about my last upload.\n\n\nSincerely, Arg_the_pirate\n\n**No Malware Certified**\n\nThis torrent uses IPv6. :)\n\n\nP.S.: You wouldn't believe how hard this was to find. Microsoft obviously doesn't want to support XP anymore, so the download is hidden away deep within their database! I had to find the link on a tech forum.\n\nWill be doing the same thing for Windows XP 64 Bit Edition. I just have to find it now...\n\nOkay, it has become very hard to find the drivers for Windows XP x64. I will not stop looking, though. And if you find it, please, if you would so kindly give me the link or host it yourself. We are in this together, people.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6684bc4454e33d8f697e20ff6bc9ba9549fae2b6","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Xbox+360+Wired+Controller+Drivers+for+WinXP-32+bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6684bc4454e33d8f697e20ff6bc9ba9549fae2b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,132,188,68,84,227,61,143,105,126,32,255,107,201,186,149,73,250,226,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
