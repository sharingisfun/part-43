Each episode is broadcast on BBC\nThree on Saturdays, immediately after the broadcast of the weekly television\nepisode on BBC One. The running time of the first two series was 30 minutes,\nbeing extended to 45 minutes in the third.BBC Three also broadcasts a cut-down\nedition of the programme, lasting 15 minutes, shown after the repeats on Sundays\n&amp; Fridays and after the weekday evening repeats of earlier seasons.\n\nDescribed as focusing on the human element of the series, Confidential features\nbehind-the-scenes footage on the making of Doctor Who through clips and\ninterviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who\nhave participated in the television series over the years of its existence. Each\nepisode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the Doctor Who\nepisode that preceded it.\n\nTo date, there have also been two episodes of Doctor Who Confidential broadcast\napart from the showing of Doctor Who episodes: in November 2006 an edition\nsubtitled &quot;Music and Monsters&quot; was produced going behind the scenes of a\ntelevised concert of soundtrack music produced as part of that year's Children in\nNeed appeal, and on 3 January 2009, a special edition was broadcast to\nannounce the actor chosen to play the Eleventh Doctor.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : BDAV\nFormat/Info                      : Blu-ray Video\nFile size                        : 2.00 GiB\nDuration                         : 57mn 2s\nOverall bit rate                 : 5024 Kbps\nMaximum Overall bit rate         : 35.5 Mbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4800212f2008047c6678&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 4368 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1280 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.158\nWriting library                  : x264 core \n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : CM (complete main)\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nLanguage                         : English\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/09879479125659623479.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/09879479125659623479.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065b87b09383ea1f8121d28b2efb4be5cf6b12a1","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+Confidential+-+Planet+of+the+Dead+2009+%5BBDRip%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065b87b09383ea1f8121d28b2efb4be5cf6b12a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,91,135,176,147,131,234,31,129,33,210,139,46,251,75,229,207,107,18,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
