Enjoy your favorite applications in a virtual environment on your new computer.\n      When itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to upgrade to a new PC with a new operating system, you may find that some of your favorite applications havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been updated yet to work with your new computer. Using ParagonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Virtualization Manager 2009, you can migrate to a new computer and make a virtual clone of your old system. Take advantage of an up-to-date powerful computer while still having access to favorite applications from the old computer.\n    * Safely Evaluate New Software\n      New software can be unintentionally harmful to your computer. You can easily avoid negative system conflicts by creating a virtual clone of your current physical system using Virtualization Manager 2009. Try new software in a safe environment and decide whether it works and is exactly what you need before making it a permanent addition to your collection.\n    * Virtualization for Backup Purposes\n      Creating a virtual clone of your physical system and saving it to the network is a good alternative to traditional disk imaging. In case of hardware failure, you can still work with your applications in a virtual environment from any other computer until your own PC is repaired ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a solution that traditional backup software canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help you with.\n    * Multiple Operating Systems on One Computer\n      Virtualization makes it possible to install and run several completely incompatible operating systems on one computer, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (only as host-operating system).\n\n\nMore infos at\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.giveawayoftheday.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.giveawayoftheday.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/vm-personal/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.paragon-software.com/home/vm-personal/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nThe Portable SFX EXE file is built up using WinRAR. You can use it to extract the files and check them one by one if you want to be sure of what is running on your machine.\n\n\nThis has also been built on an XP x86 machine, I don't know if this program can run on a x64 or Vista machine. I't's up to you to check it if you are using them.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS ON USING P2P DOWNLOADS\n==================================\n\n1) It's always better to run all downloaded programs using Sandboxie or a similar virtual machine until you are sure they are clean.\n\n\n2) When in doubt, scan them with an Internet Scan service as the ones provided by Jotti and VirusTotal\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://virusscan.jotti.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.virustotal.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis will ***NOT*** give you any warranty that a file passing their analysis is clean, nor that if they see them as a troian it's so or not just another false positive, but helps you to decide and at least ask for help or infos.\n\n\n3) Remember, trust nobody, and when in doubt, go to point 1) \n\n\n4) If you find any upload containing trojans or whatsoever malicious or unclean, instead of start cursing in the comments of the upload, take the time to go to the Suprbay Forum at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand report links and comments there, and someone will take care of all the nasties.\n\n\nThat's the only way to keep TPB and its uploads fresh and clean.\n\n\nThat's for what is regarding security. If after testing it you see that you like it and it's useful for you, show your support by buying it!\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31db8d98cfa6ed828054b89a7a60096e8ced6c68","amp;dn":"Paragon+Virtualization+Manager+2009+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31db8d98cfa6ed828054b89a7a60096e8ced6c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,219,141,152,207,166,237,130,128,84,184,154,122,96,9,110,140,237,108,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
