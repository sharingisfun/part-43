An even larger one happened around the years AD 935-940. It released more gases, and produced more ash and lava, than Laki, but apart from the evidence from the lava flows and fissure cones themselves, it has been difficult to interpret the degree of effects that this eruption, known as EldgjÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½, had on the atmosphere and environment of the northern hemisphere.\n\nVolcano historian and climatologist Richard Stothers of NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies, New York, published a summary in 1998 of what little can be gleaned from the few written sources dating from those Dark Ages.\n\nBefore the AD 930 eruption and up to the time of the Laki eruption, there were also several other smaller eruptions of this type in Iceland, but they released much less ash, sulphur dioxide, and other gases.\n\nWhen will there be another large eruption in Iceland?\n\nWith such few cases of past eruptions to go by, it is difficult to predict when or how big the next occurrence of a similar eruption will be, but one thing is certain, it will happen. Actually, as fair a prediction as any might be that it could be any day now!\n\nIt could be next week (unlikely, as there should be some precursor effects such as earthquakes and no anomalous ones are currently being reported), or next year, or five hundred years from now.\n\nBritons may take comfort in not having an active volcano here on our islands, but the one frequently active area that could have a direct effect here on a time scale to which we can relate is Iceland and its many restless volcanoes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.open2.net/timewatch/icelandic_eruptions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.open2.net/timewatch/icelandic_eruptions.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_airspace_closed_by_volcanic_ash&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikinews.org/wiki/European_airspace_closed_by_volcanic_ash&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nImages and more info at  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Killer_Cloud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Killer_Cloud&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4578fbc8c6ec551bdfcd7528825ba7e4ea416f89","amp;dn":"Timewatch+2007+Killer+Cloud+%281783+Iceland+Volcano%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4578fbc8c6ec551bdfcd7528825ba7e4ea416f89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,120,251,200,198,236,85,27,223,205,117,40,130,91,167,228,234,65,111,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
