James Maddock has certainly had his share. He had a taste of stardom in 2000 and then hit bottom as he adjusted to life in the States, saw his marriage fail, and had his record label decide to drop him and not release his follow-up album to Songs from Stamford Hill with his band Wood. After that round of bad luck, Maddock disappeared from the limelight. But he didn't give up during the last ten years.\n\nIn 2009, Maddock came back and is telling stories through the tracks of Sunrise on Avenue C. Each of the twelve songs tells a bit of the story about a relationship beginning, waning, and possibly ending. It's a rare thing to find an album crafted to be listened to beginning to end. But when you find such an album, I feel you should enjoy it the way it was meant to be heard instead of picking and choosing individual songs.\n\nThese songs have a little of everything - strings, guitar, piano - and beautifully constructed melodies and lyrics. It's obvious he took his time getting this effort &quot;just right&quot; before releasing it to the public. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/13/james-maddock/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/13/james-maddock/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1119d379b823d2214bf4977b16017786f371dece","amp;dn":"James+Maddock...Sunrise+On+Avenue+C%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1119d379b823d2214bf4977b16017786f371dece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,25,211,121,184,35,210,33,75,244,151,123,22,1,119,134,243,113,222,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
