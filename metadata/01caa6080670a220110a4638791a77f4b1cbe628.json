The song was written by Shakira and Luis Fernando Ochoa, and will be released on January 4, 2011. &quot;Sale el Sol&quot; was announced as the second single from the album on November 6, 2010 via Shakira's official fan site. It had also been confirmed through an announcement on the Pies Descalzos Foundation site.\n\nThe music video was directed by Jaume de Laiguana in Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain on November 10, 2010 while she was also filming the Christmas campaign for Freixenet. The video leaked on Shakira's 34th birthday on February 2nd, 2011, before its official release on February 3rd. It shows Shakira performing with her band in a dark Winter scenery, while other scenes show her in a golden dress walking through a maze. A storm arises and causes chaos, but in the end she finds a door in the maze that leads her out of the storm and out into a sunny landscape.\n\nThe song was written and produced by Shakira and Luis Fernando Ochoa. The track is described as &quot;a beautiful mid-tÃƒï¿½Ã‚Âµmpo rock tune with acoustic and electro guitars, telling of rises and falls in everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life&quot;. In a review of Sale el Sol made by Billboard, the song was described as &quot;wistful and beautiful&quot;.\n\nMany fans have cited similarities between &quot;Sale el Sol&quot; and some songs from her older eras, mostly with &quot;Inevitable&quot; (which was also a Shakira/Ochoa composition) due to the song structure and its rocky sound.\n\n&quot;Sale el Sol&quot; premiered at number-eight in the Spanish Singles Chart, celebrating the highest debut of the week-ending December 19, 2010. That week, &quot;Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)&quot; settled at number-one. In the Mexican Top 20, the song peaked at number five. In the United States, it entered the top ten of the Latin Pop Airplay chart, at #5 and the top forty of the main Latin Chart, peaking at #28.[ Elsewhere, it entered the unofficial charts from Chile, Costa Rica and the Italian Airplay Chart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01caa6080670a220110a4638791a77f4b1cbe628","amp;dn":"Shakira+-+Sale+el+Sol+%28mp4-2nafish%29+1080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01caa6080670a220110a4638791a77f4b1cbe628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,202,166,8,6,112,162,32,17,10,70,56,121,26,119,244,177,203,230,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
