The charismatic Ethiopian economist wants to end hunger in her famine-plagued country. But rather than relying on foreign aid or new agricultural technology, she has a truly radical plan. She has designed the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first commodities exchange, which she hopes will revolutionize an ancient market system whose inefficiencies have been partly responsible for the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s persistent food shortages.\n\nIn April 2008 and after more than a decade of planning, the starting bell rang on the trading floor for the first time. Gabre-Madhin has been running frantically ever since. She attempts to maintain the machinery that keeps her country fed while facing powerful special interests, antiquated farming practices, poor infrastructure, and an unpredictable climate. Not to mention a global economic crisis.\n\nWIDE ANGLE travels to East Africa for The Market Maker, hosted by anchor Aaron Brown, to tell the dramatic, intimate story of a woman on a mission ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and a world of trouble standing in her way.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 466 MiB for 56mn 30s 890ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 036 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 104 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c64b229911b35a1071426eb53ef21b034c83b6fc","amp;dn":"PBS+Wide+Angle+-+The+Market+Maker.07.22.2009.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c64b229911b35a1071426eb53ef21b034c83b6fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,75,34,153,17,179,90,16,113,66,110,181,62,242,27,3,76,131,182,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
