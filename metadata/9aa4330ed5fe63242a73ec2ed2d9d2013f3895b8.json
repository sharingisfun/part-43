In the comic, the Shogun Warriors were created by a mysterious group called the Followers of the Light.  Human operators were chosen from all around the world to operate the massive robots in order to battle evil.  The series is firmly rooted in the Marvel Universe as evidenced by their interactions with Doctor Demonicus in issues #12-14 and the Fantastic Four in the last two issues of the series.\nThough he never appeared in the comic series, Red Ronin (a robot created for Marvel's Godzilla comic) was mentioned occasionally and was frequently talked about in the letters pages.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa4330ed5fe63242a73ec2ed2d9d2013f3895b8","amp;dn":"Shogun+Warriors+%28Marvel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa4330ed5fe63242a73ec2ed2d9d2013f3895b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,164,51,14,213,254,99,36,42,115,236,46,210,217,210,1,63,56,149,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
