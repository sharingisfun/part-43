The width of the pages is reduced so no horizontal scrolling is necessary at a comfortable zoom, and the length of pages is increased so you don't have to flip pages every 20seconds.\n\nI've been using a modded version of Bookr (Bookr-Mod 2009-07-09) to read these available here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dl.qj.net/Bookr-Mod-2009-07-09-PSP-Homebrew-Applications/pg/12/fid/27363/catid/151&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dl.qj.net/Bookr-Mod-2009-07-09-PSP-Homebrew-Applications/pg/12/fid/27363/catid/151&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI use this version because it has embedded bookmark/outline support so you can jump to specific chapters via the embedded bookmarks, but any ol' version of bookr should be fine (although I've read some builds have issues loading large files).\n\n\n\nI TAKE NO CREDIT for scanning and/or formatting text of these eBooks. I only took already existing eBooks and converted them (I saw a torrent uploaded by Spanko here at TPB that looks like the source I used, but I found mine at a random RS link so I can't be sure).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9d5e1886e6db3f1412effc882d7ec7564e7b57","amp;dn":"Robert+Jordan+-+Wheel+of+Time+eBooks+%28PSP+formatted%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9d5e1886e6db3f1412effc882d7ec7564e7b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,157,94,24,134,230,219,63,20,18,239,252,136,45,126,199,86,78,123,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
