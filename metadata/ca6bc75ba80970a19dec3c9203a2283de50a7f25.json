This three-part mini-series traces the history of coffee.\n\nPart 3: The Perfect Cup\n\nThe Perfect Cup heralds what some coffee experts have called &quot;the romantic age of coffee.&quot; North Americans rediscovered what their Europeans counterparts have known all along: coffee is better when it's quality coffee, and the best place to drink it is in the relaxed and friendly atmosphere of the cafe. A quirky collection of entrepreneurs emerged from the '70s to create mega-chains like Starbucks and Second Cup in the '80s. Coffee became the first global industry to experiment with Fair Trade practices and a new breed of co-operative farmer was born in Central America. The new coffee consumers expected social justice in their morning cup. Consequently, marketing executives began to realize that &quot;fair trade&quot; is more than ethics, it is good business. Consumers felt better knowing that their coffee habit is contributing to sustainable agriculture practices and increased profit for small grower.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 467 MiB for 57mn 46s 132ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 012 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 105 Kbps VBR\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6bc75ba80970a19dec3c9203a2283de50a7f25","amp;dn":"PBS+Special-Black+Coffee+30f3.%282005%29.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6bc75ba80970a19dec3c9203a2283de50a7f25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,107,199,91,168,9,112,161,157,236,60,146,3,162,40,61,229,10,127,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
