Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go.\n\nThroughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included FlikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.\n\nSeveral bosses are encountered during the game:\n\n    * Thumper\n    * The Bird\n    * Thud\n    * Molt\n    * Hopper\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9c9b61d812804829bdc9616b97a37af113971a1","amp;dn":"Disneys+A+Bugs+Life+%28PSX%29+%28PS1%29+%28Use+ePSXe+to+Play%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9c9b61d812804829bdc9616b97a37af113971a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,201,182,29,129,40,4,130,155,220,150,22,185,122,55,175,17,57,113,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
