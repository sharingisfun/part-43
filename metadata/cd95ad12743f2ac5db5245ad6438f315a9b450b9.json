It consisted of Stephan Remmler, Gert 'Kralle' Krawinkel, and Peter Behrens. By far, the band is most noted for the song &quot;Da da da, ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha&quot; (usually simply &quot;Da Da Da&quot;) which was a hit in 30 countries worldwide.\n\nThe song is often given as an example of a song that has become popular while being extremely repetitive. However, to understand Trio one must understand its context. It was a product of the Neue Deutsche Welle (or NDW). However, Trio preferred the name Neue Deutsche FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶hlichkeit, which means &quot;New German Cheerfulness&quot;, to describe their music. At that time, as now, popular songs were based on extremely simple structures that were ornately produced. Trio's main principle was to remove almost all the ornamentation and polish from their songs, and to use the simplest practical structures (most of their songs were three-chord songs). For this reason, many of their songs are restricted to drums, guitar, vocals, and just one or maybe two other instruments, if any at all. Bass was used very infrequently until their later songs, and live shows often saw Remmler playing some simple preprogrammed rhythms and melodies on his small Casio VL-1 keyboard while Behrens played his drums single-handedly while eating an apple. This simplicity was not simply due to an inability to sing or play well; Remmler's later solo career shows that he was capable of much more complicated music, and Kralle has demonstrated considerable ability as a guitarist in other ventures. Rather, their songs were bare-boned to show how bare the bones actually are.\n\nThe band produced a number of albums. There are many versions of Bye Bye (marked with different advertisements on the cover); versions in North America are called TRIO and Error and feature no advertisements. The 1997 CD of TRIO and Error was also released as Da Da Da in the United States, in response to the 1997 US Volkswagen commercial that featured the song &quot;Da Da Da I Don't Love You You Don't Love Me Aha Aha Aha&quot;, often contracted to simply &quot;Da Da Da&quot;. The re-release had some changes: two songs were added and the album was digitally remastered.\n\nThe band never got very popular outside of Germany, and are largely forgotten even for their one hit. However, in its time, Trio had some popularity in Germany. For instance, the German version of &quot;Da da da&quot; was #2 on the charts (April 1982). Its most notable songs, other than Da Da Da, are probably &quot;Broken Hearts for You and Me&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Hearts are Trump&quot;, and &quot;Anna Letmein Letmeout&quot;. All of these songs except the first have a corresponding German version, which sometimes differs considerably, and these were also released in the English-speaking world. &quot;Da da da&quot; hit #2 in the UK in July 1982 and #3 in Canada in December 1982. They had another three top ten hits in Germany until the end of 1983, then disbanded the following year. Every member launched a solo career, with only Remmler managing to be somewhat successful.\n\nThey produced a movie called &quot;Drei gegen Drei&quot;, meaning &quot;Three Against Three&quot;. In the movie, three people (played by Trio) kill doubles of themselves as part of a twisted scam to gain riches. However, the movie flopped miserably; even avid Trio fan Matthias Klein said, &quot;[the members of] Trio are not actors&quot;. The corresponding soundtrack is the album What's the Password, however, drummer Peter Behrens does not perform in any of the songs, despite appearing on the album's cover. He left the band due to dissatisfaction with Kralle and Remmler over financial matters, leading to the complete breakup of Trio in 1985.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd95ad12743f2ac5db5245ad6438f315a9b450b9","amp;dn":"Trio+-+Trio+and+Error+%5BBye+Bye%5D+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd95ad12743f2ac5db5245ad6438f315a9b450b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,149,173,18,116,63,42,197,219,82,69,173,100,56,243,21,169,180,80,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
