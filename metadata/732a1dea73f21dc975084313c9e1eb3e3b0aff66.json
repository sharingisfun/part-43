It must be better. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I was thinking. DVDs are MPEG. Transport streams of HDTV are MPEG.\n&quot;Bitrate is too small for better quality&quot; has been another argument.\nNo, bitrate is fine.\n&quot;File-size is too small, like XviDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ it cannot be better&quot; was the answer.\nNo, file-size is not the problem.\nProblem is when someone thinks it knows, and knows squat.\nHere is DVD compliant MPEG with 2 ch. AC3 sound.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:732a1dea73f21dc975084313c9e1eb3e3b0aff66","amp;dn":"Dexter.S04E10.HDTV.MPEG.%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"732a1dea73f21dc975084313c9e1eb3e3b0aff66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,42,29,234,115,242,29,201,117,8,67,19,201,225,235,62,59,10,255,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
