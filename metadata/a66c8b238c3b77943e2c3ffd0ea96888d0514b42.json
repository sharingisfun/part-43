Numbered Promo Only:\nThe No More Tears Demo Sessions,\nTrack 6: Mrs. J, (Zakk Wylde Instrumental)\nAll other tracks from this except Time After Time (Demo) are included in the &quot;Prince Of Darkness&quot; Box Set\nAccording to my research, it is pretty much the same anyway, as the album version, just not quite studio quality.\n\nLive Albums\n1.

NOT the 2002 re-issues with re-recorded drum/bass. But I also include the bonus songs from  \n        the re-issues. I know this because I ripped it personally from my own copy, which was purchased way before 2002.\nNote 2: Alternate Cover Arts included here.\nNote 3: Only those that do not contain content elsewhere in the Discog\nNote 4: With the Exception of 3 songs, this is basically the same as disc 4 in &quot;Prince&quot; Box, I included &quot;Changes&quot; in it as the \n        Jap release contains it. And don't knock this release, Ozzy did it as a bonus, in spare time between shows. Sony only \n        wanted to release the 1st 3 Discs. He feels his fans have been screwed over by the record company. Sony, another Evil \n        empire.\nNote 5: I have included full size cover arts here as well.\n\nEnjoy, please help me Seed!\nHMD3\noh and Thanks to CanadaJoe for obtaining the &quot;How?&quot; single.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66c8b238c3b77943e2c3ffd0ea96888d0514b42","amp;dn":"Ozzy+Osbourne+Discog+%5B320kbps%5D%5BHMD3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66c8b238c3b77943e2c3ffd0ea96888d0514b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,108,139,35,140,59,119,148,62,44,63,253,14,169,104,136,208,81,75,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
