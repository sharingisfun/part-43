But since God is everything and \neveryone, who is there for Him to forgive? Forgiveness of the \ncreated was already there in His act of creation. But still people \nask God's forgiveness, and He forgives them. But they, instead of \nforgetting that for which they asked forgiveness, forget that God \nhas forgiven them, and, instead, remember the things they were \nforgiven ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and so nourish the seed of wrongdoing, and it bears its \nfruit again. Again and again they plead for forgiveness, and again \nand again the Master says, I forgive.\n \nBut it is impossible for men to forget their wrongdoings and the \nwrongs done to them by others. And since they cannot forget, \nthey find it hard to forgive. But forgiveness is the best charity. \nIt is easy to give the poor money and goods when one has plenty, \nbut to forgive is hard; but it is the best thing if one can do it. \n\nInstead of men trying to forgive one another they fight. Once they \nfought with their hands and with clubs. Then with spears and \nbows and arrows. Then with guns and cannon. Then they \ninvented bombs and carriers for them. Now they have developed \nmissiles that can destroy millions of other men thousands of miles \naway, and they are prepared to use them. The weapons used \nchange, but the aggressive pattern of man remains the same. \n\nNow men are planning to go to the moon. And the first to get there \nwill plant his nation's flag on it, and that nation will say, \nIt is mine. But another nation will dispute the claim and they will\nfight here on this earth for possession of that moon. And whoever\ngoes there, what will he find? Nothing but himself. And if people\ngo on to Venus they will still find nothing but themselves. Whether \nmen soar to outer space or dive to the bottom of the deepest ocean\nthey will find themselves as they are, unchanged, because they will\nnot have forgotten themselves nor remembered to exercise the charity\nof forgiveness.\n \nSupremacy over others will never cause a man to find a change in \nhimself; the greater his conquests the stronger is his confirmation \nof what his mind tells him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that there is no God other than his \nown power. And he remains separated from God, the Absolute Power.  \nBut when the same mind tells him that there is something which \nmay be called God, and, further, when it prompts him to search \nfor God that he may see Him face to face, he begins to forget \nhimself and to forgive others for whatever he has suffered from \nthem. \n\nAnd when he has forgiven everyone and has completely forgotten \nhimself, he finds that God has forgiven him everything, and he \nremembers Who, in reality, he is. \n \nMeher Baba","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ee45fa4bc24ac7ab147fdcfa568dc5f4d8f2c12","amp;dn":"Meher+Baba+-+The+Everything+and+the+Nothing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ee45fa4bc24ac7ab147fdcfa568dc5f4d8f2c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,228,95,164,188,36,172,122,177,71,253,207,165,104,220,95,77,143,44,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
