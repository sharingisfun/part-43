While ETs seeded the planet, and developed the human race from monkeys, it is only in the last 50 years or so, that volunteer souls from other planets and spiritual dimensions have been coming to Earth to be born in human bodies, she explained. The timing of this relates to the development of nuclear weapons in the 1940s, and the aliens' concern that humanity might destroy itself, she continued. Because the ETs have a policy of non-interference, they felt that bringing new souls, without previous karma, to Earth could bring about a positive change from within, she said.\n\nShe delineated three waves of volunteers:\n\n- First Wave-- These people would be in their 40s and early 50s now, finally adjusting to life after going through turbulent early years of feeling they didn't belong here. A number tried to commit suicide or were treated for depression.\n\n- 2nd Wave-- Presently in their 20s and 30s, these folk had an easier time, and have been called &quot;channels, generators, and antennas,&quot; and project positive energy. Many have chosen not to have children, as this creates karma, and they don't want to have to return to Earth after this life.\n\n- 3rd Wave-- The New Children are coming into the world with altered DNA, so they can function in a different reality (vibrations are pushing Earth into a new dimension).\n\nCannon also touched on her communications with Nostradamus, who told her about the power of the &quot;group mind&quot; to change things, and forestall dire events. She believes we have averted the worst of what Nostradamus warned about, including the coming of the third Antichrist. \n\nCancer Controversies\n\nLast hour guest, Dr. Len Saputo talked about how over-testing for certain cancers is encouraged by &quot;Big Pharma&quot; as a way to reap profits from chemotherapy. For instance, a lot of prostate cancers are non-malignant and don't benefit from chemo, he commented. For more, see this blog posting about how the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society admitted that certain screening practices actually create more cancer patients than there need to be.\n\nWebsite(s):\nozarkmt.com\nareturntohealing.com\n\nBook(s):\nConversations With Nostradamus Vol. I\nThe Convoluted Universe: Book One\nA Return to Healing\n\n\n\nbrought to you by:\n                                                \n .d8888b.                                                      888    \nd88P  Y88b                                                     888    \n888    888                                                     888    \n888    888 888  888  .d88b.  888d888 .d8888b  8888b.  .d8888b  888888 \n888    888 888  888 d8P  Y8b 888P&quot;  d88P&quot;        &quot;88b 88K      888    \n888    888 Y88  88P 88888888 888    888      .d888888 &quot;Y8888b. 888    \nY88b  d88P  Y8bd8P  Y8b.     888    Y88b.    888  888      X88 Y88b.  \n &quot;Y8888P&quot;    Y88P    &quot;Y8888  888     &quot;Y8888P &quot;Y888888  88888P'  &quot;Y888 \n\nTorrents: http://thepiratebay.se/user/0vercast/\nRSS: http://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/2eb7e342dacfa8938e79732ad03e1224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf4f67a946ce5b677f8c2354e99d7b11f01b720","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+Oct+22+2009+-+Volunteer+Souls+%26+Lost+Knowled","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf4f67a946ce5b677f8c2354e99d7b11f01b720","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,244,246,122,148,108,229,182,119,248,194,53,78,153,215,177,31,1,183,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
