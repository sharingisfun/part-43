But Seal is more relaxed, and his craftsmanship is delicate and well defined. Lyrical depictions are light, songwriting is personal, and production credits are most impressive. With star-studded work from both Trevor Horn (Tina Turner, the Art of Noise, Rod Stewart) and Trevor Rabin (Yes, John Miles), Seal is surely a critical hit. Becoming a mainstream radio mainstay for the summer of 1991, the single &quot;Crazy&quot; carried heavy notoriety for Seal and instantly made him a household name. His collaborative effort with Adamski for &quot;Killer&quot; was a massive club hit thanks to its Hi-NRG strength, but house elements are showcased other album tracks such as &quot;The Beginning.&quot; Seal is not necessarily a dance innovator, but he makes for a select crossover artist with impeccable talent worthy of heavy acclamation and critical recognition. The general mood captured on his debut album is refreshing for the early-'90s mediocrity of post-hair metal and manufactured synth bands. His music was a major force throughout the decade and well into the new millennium. With Trevor Horn at his side, it's undeniable. Together they go for exactly what Seal is looking for: the beauty, desire, and simplicity in creating a new sound. Seal is the face and Horn is the face behind it all.&quot;\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nSeal (1991)\n==========\n\n01. &quot;The Beginning&quot;  (Seal, Sigsworth) - 5:39 \n02. &quot;Deep Water&quot;  (Seal) - 5:56  \n03. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Samuel, Sigsworth) -  4:47 \n04. &quot;Killer&quot;  (Seal, Tinley) -  6:22  \n05. &quot;Whirlpool&quot;  (Seal) - 3:56  \n06. &quot;Future Love Paradise&quot;  (Seal) - 4:20  \n07. &quot;Wild&quot;  (Seal, Sigsworth) -  5:19  \n08. &quot;Show Me&quot; (Seal) - 5:59  \n09. &quot;Violet&quot; (Seal, Sigsworth) - 8:06 \n\n+\n\n10. &quot;Killer&quot; (Original Version, Adamski 1990) - 4:13\n11. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Single Version) - 4:30\n12. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Extended Version) - 5:09\n13. &quot;Krazy&quot; - 6:26\n14. &quot;Crazy&quot; (William Orbit Remix) - 5:29\n15. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Accapella Mix) - 3:28\n16. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Chick On My Tip Mix) - 6:46\n17. &quot;Crazy&quot; (Do You Know The Way To LA Mix) - 3:52\n18. &quot;Future Love Paradise&quot; (EP Version) - 5:34\n19. &quot;Future Love Paradise&quot; (Reprise) - 2:26\n20. &quot;The Beginning&quot; (Single Version) - 4:08\n21. &quot;The Beginning&quot; (Giro E Giro Mix) - 7:06\n22. &quot;The Beginning&quot; (Remix) - 4:41\n23. &quot;A Minor Groove&quot; (Seal/Sigsworth) - 5:54\n24. &quot;Killer&quot; (William Orbit Mix) - 6:43\n25. &quot;Killer ...On The Loose&quot; (Single Version / Acoustic) - 9:23\n26. &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (Roberts) (Acoustic/Live) - 4:20\n27. &quot;Come See What Love Has Done&quot; (Seal/Sigsworth) (Acoustic/Live) - 4:30\n28. &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (Acoustic/Live) - 4:37\n29. &quot;Deep Water&quot; (Acoustic/Live) - 3:43\n30. &quot;Violet&quot; (Acoustic/Live) - 2:39\n\n&quot;...behold, here comes the dreamer.
