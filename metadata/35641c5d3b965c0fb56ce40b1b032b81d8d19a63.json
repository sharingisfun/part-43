It was founded in 1995 by Yannis Kamarinos and Jean-michel Blanchet, but since 2000 Yannis is working alone under the Jaia name.\n\nThe first album, Blue Energy, was released in 1998. Two years later it was re-released with an additional CD under the name Blue Energy/Blue Synergy. In 2005 the next album - Fiction appeared. Compared to the previous CDs, it isn't a typical goa-trance CD, but a crossover between progressive trance, progressive house, psy morning trance and electro.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35641c5d3b965c0fb56ce40b1b032b81d8d19a63","amp;dn":"Jaia+-+Fiction+%282005%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35641c5d3b965c0fb56ce40b1b032b81d8d19a63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,100,28,93,59,150,92,15,181,108,228,11,27,3,43,129,216,209,154,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
