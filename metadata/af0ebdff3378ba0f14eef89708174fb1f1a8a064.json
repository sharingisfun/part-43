Funds from the sale of the record, titled Our New Orleans, go to Habitat for Humanity to aid those affected by the recent Hurricane Katrina disaster. Several of New OrleansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ best-known musicians  contributed songs that are integral to their lives and that express their feelings about the city and the recent events there. The album was made swiftly and simply, over the course of a month, in several one-day sessions in cities across the country. \nSessions began in New York in late September 2005 with Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the Wild Magnolias (Doug Petty and Matt Sakakeeny, producers); Allen Toussaint, Irma Thomas and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band (Joe Henry, producer); and Jon Cleary and Dr. John (Hal Willner and Mark Bingham, producers). Buckwheat Zydeco recorded in Memphis on October 3 (Ry Cooder, producer); Randy Newman and others artists contributed tracks later in the month. \n\nNonesuchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parent companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Warner Bros. Records, part of the Warner Music GroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½donated all of the production costs for Our New Orleans as part of the GroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s larger efforts on behalf of hurricane victims on the Gulf Coast. Many others involved in creating the album also generously donated their time and services.\n\n\n\nPersonnel &amp; Track Listing\n\n1.
