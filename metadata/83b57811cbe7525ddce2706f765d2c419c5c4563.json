Eddie Izzard aims to find out.\n\nCall Yourself English?\n\nTwo-thousand years of invasion, immigration and the infusion of foreign ideas, and you thought you were English? These quirky facts are enough to pull the rug from under any Englishman!\n\nMore than 95% of us, who call ourselves English, are in fact descended from foreign people.\n\nIn 1750, when the slave trade was at its height, one in 20 Londoners was black. Due to multiracial marriages and children in the 18th century, it is probable that many of us have a black ancestor in our genealogy.\n\nWhen we refer to someone as being an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“English roseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, we could easily substitute the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EnglishÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“GermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ as we are referring to the genetic characteristics of the invading Saxons.\n\nGenetic research shows that the Y-chromosomes of the majority of British males prove that ethnically we are about as Germanic as you can get.\n\nOur patron saint ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saint George ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is now believed to be a Turkish knight. In other words, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as English as a kebab!\n\nOur Monarchy is German. From the coronation oath based on Anglo-Saxon traditions via the Hanoverians to the Saxe-Coburgh-Gothas (alias Windsors) currently ruling over us, our monarchy is about as English as the Munich beer festival!\n\nThe Bank of England is anything but English in origin. It was set up in 1694 on the model of the Bank of Holland, and its first governor was Sir John Houblon, a Dutch Walloon.\n\nThe English Sunday roast is in fact a Roman invention. If the Romans hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t invaded England, we could still be eating a lumpy soup-like slop cooked in one pot!\n\nYou may think that a Savile Row suit is a quintessentially English luxury. However, fine tailoring was initiated in England in the 16th century by the Dutch Walloons and refined by the French Huguenots.\n\nThe Irish virtually built Britain. When you travel on the London Underground, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth remembering that every yard of tunnel is most probably the work of Irish navvies.\n\nFrom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“royalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“roast beefÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, many of the words most associated with English traditions come from the French language.\n\nWhat could be more British than the ultimate symbols of the monarchy, the Crown Jewels? Too many things to name actually, as almost all the gems in the royal collection were plundered from far-flung corners of Asia and Africa.\n\nThis June (2003) on Discovery Channel a new three part series being presented by comedian/actor Eddie Izzard, will argue that the English and their culture are perhaps more of a melting pot than they might think - that in other words they are a Mongrel Nation.\n\nKey Customs\n\nTravelling around the UK and mainland Europe, Mongrel Nation presents a fascinating historical investigation into some of EnglandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s key customs, traditions and culture - many of which the programme discovers were adopted and taken up as our own over the centuries.\n\nCovering everything from genetic and genealogical heritage, language, place names, buildings, culture, food, money, commerce, names, key institutions, humour, religion and art, the programme argues that many components of our national heritage and identity have been imported over the years.\n\nThe three programmes will take three distinct angles - Invasion, Immigration and Infusion - and argue that all three have had major influences on England and the English. ...\n\nOur system of government which is a complete mongrel creation ? with a mix of influences from the Romans, the Vikings, the Saxons and even the Normans, all of who left their mark long after they invaded our shores. The English pound which is yet another thing that the Romans did for us, before which we had no currency of our own and bartered goods as a way of life.\n\nEnglish Institutions\n\nAmong the key English institutions that Eddie uncovers as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“importsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are:\n\nThe eponymous English Sunday Roast which was actually introduced to our diet by the invading Romans.\n\nEnglish cleanliness, which Eddie discovers, was imported from India.\n\nThe English Language which is in fact Germanic.\n\nOur system of government which is a complete mongrel creation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with a mix of influences from the Romans, the Vikings, the Saxons and even the Normans. All of who left their mark long after they invaded our shores.\nThe English pound which is yet another thing that the RomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s did for us, before which we had no currency of our own and bartered goods as a way of life.\n\nOur patron saint ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saint George ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ who historians now believe was Turkish and, as Eddie eloquently puts it, as English as a kebab!\n\nINVASION\n--------\nIn the first episode of Mongrel Nation, comedian Eddie Izzard takes us on a whistle-stop tour of the four successive waves of invasion which swept over England. From the Romans to the Saxon and Viking invasions through to the Norman conquest, all these people brought with them a whole new way of life. Mongrel Nation shows that perhaps our culture is more of a melting pot than we might think.\n\nHere are some ways in which the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“invaders' left their mark:\n\nIf a place name includes the words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“chesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“cesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, it is because it is on the site of a Roman fort. The word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“chesterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ comes from the Roman word for fort ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“castrumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nMany types of plants and animals, including sweet chestnut trees and chickens, were introduced to Britain during Roman times.\n\nThe word plumbing comes from the Latin word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“plumbumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, meaning lead. In fact you can see the remains of flushing lavatories used by Roman soldiers used at Housesteads Fort on Hadrian's Wall.\n\nThe collective term 'Anglo-Saxon', by which these Germanic tribes are now known, was invented by the Normans, as a legal definition of the people they had conquered.\n\nIn 1939, archaeologists found traces of an Anglo-Saxon ship and many precious objects at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. It is thought that this was the grave of King Redwald, who died around 625.\n\nThe southern boundary of the Danelaw (the VikingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ territory in the north of England) forms the basis of what we now call the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“North-South divideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\nOur days of the week come from Viking gods: Tuesday is named after Tyr, god of war, Wednesday after Woden, the chief god, Thursday after Thor, god of thunder, and Friday from WodenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife, Frigga, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“mother goddessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\nRegions where Vikings settled can often be recognised by the endings of the place name: by denoted a village, thorpe a farm, keld a well, and thwaite a meadow. Hence, we have Grimsby and Scunthorpe.\n\nEveryday words like freckle, leg, elm, giant, moon, sun, wine, week, berg, dale, land, island, sound, earl, garden, anchor, boat, steer, market, penny, shilling, skirt, bowl, hell, and law all come from the Vikings.\n\nOur aristocracy is descended from the French since when William, Duke of Normandy became king of England, he appointed his own men as feudal lords.\n\nNot dissimilar to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ethnic cleansingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of the Bosnian conflict, under the rule of William and the French, Anglo-Saxons became second-class citizens in their own country.\n\nConsidered by most as an architectural landmark of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BritishnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, the Tower of London was ordered to be built by the Normans (French) so they could show the English who was in charge.\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: 01 Invasion.avi\nFilesize.....: 400 MB (or 409,800 KB or 419,635,200 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:53 (70,323 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1056 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 130 kb/s (65/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.96r\u0002Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯\nframe Size...: 416x318 (1.31:1) [~17:13]\n\n\nIMMIGRATION\n-----------\nLending The Nation Colour\n\nIn the second episode of Mongrel Nation, Eddie Izzard takes a look at the different influxes of foreign immigrants who have shaped modern British life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from Jewish businessmen and French Protestant craftsmen fleeing persecution to West Indians leaving their homes in the British Commonwealth to help rebuild England after WWII.\n\nThe following facts show that ethnic variety is indeed the spice of life:\nJews fleeing Eastern Europe in the late 19th century started businesses that have become high street names such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, SainsburyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and Tesco.\n\nWe have the son of a Hungarian immigrant to thank for our Odeon cinemas. In 1928, his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“palaces for the peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hit the high street.\n\nFrench Huguenots escaping the persecution of Louis XIV in the 17th century helped found the Bank of England.\n\nIn about 1720, Lord Pembroke smuggled Huguenot craftsmen from France in empty wine casks in order to use their weaving skills at the Wilton carpet factory. Wilton is still a carpet-making centre and descendants of the original Huguenots live in nearby Dorset.\n\nThe first large group of Muslims in the UK arrived about 300 years ago ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ they were sailors recruited to work in India for the East India Company, and so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not surprising that the first Muslim communities were found in port towns.\n\nBy the end of the 1700ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, there were about 20,000 black people living in London. After a long struggle, slavery in the British Empire was finally banned in 1883.\n\nThe first recorded mosque in Britain was in Cardiff in 1860.\n\nWhen the Empire Windrush sailed into Tilbury Docks on June 22 1948, it brought 500 Jamaican passengers who would be recruited to work for the National Health Service, London Transport and the British Hotels and Restaurants Association.\n\nWhen immigrants came from Pakistan to the UK in the 1950s and 60s, they could earn 30 times as much in the UK as they could in their home country.\n\nIn 1972, 60, 000 Asians were expelled by President Amin from Uganda, many of whom were allowed to settle in Britain.\n\nOver 66% of independently-owned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“corner shopsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are run and owned by people whose families are from another country.\n\nThe majority of UK ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Indian restaurantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are run by people of Bangladeshi, not Indian, origin.\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: 02 Immigration.avi\nFilesize.....: 400 MB (or 409,808 KB or 419,643,392 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:39 (69,982 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1061 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 130 kb/s (65/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.96r\u0002Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯\nframe Size...: 416x318 (1.31:1) [~17:13]\n\n\nINFUSION\n--------\nIdeas Worth Borrowing\n\nIn the third and final episode of Mongrel Nation, Eddie Izzard looks at the almost invisible cultural, religious, institutional and linguistic foreign influences that have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“infusedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and shaped our ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EnglishnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ over the years.\n\nFrom the Church of England, to rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll and Vindaloo, these facts show that we are indeed a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“mongrelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ nation:\n\nThe Church of England, established during the rule of Henry VIII, is in fact a European invention. It took as its basis the ideas of Martin Luther (German) and John Calvin (French).\n\nBritish spaghetti know-how has come a long way since the late 1950s. In a brilliant April FoolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Day stunt, Panorama showed Richard Dimbleby walking among ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“spaghetti treesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, while workers pulled the pasta off the trees and put it into baskets!\n\nWhen the package holiday arrived in the 1950s, Britain began to adopt many of the characteristics of European living - al fresco eating, the patio, the bistro, pasta and air-kissing to name but a few!\n\nWatching today's Brits enjoying the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s favourite dish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ curry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ would have delighted Warren Hastings, Britain's first governor general in India in 1773. During his rule he had dreamt of the eventual fusion of Indian and British culture.\n\nWithout the British Empire perhaps we wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t scrub as well as we do today. The Indians brought us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“shampooÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (Persian for head massage), and the habit of using toothpaste and putting on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“pyjamasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ before going to bed.\n\nSome 900 words in the English language come from the Hindi language. These include dungarees, jodhpurs (named after their Indian town of origin), bungalow, juggernaut (meaning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“lord of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢), dinghy, mugger and pundit.\n\nThanks to the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ innovative use of Indian music in their songs, the sound of the sitar became the staple diet of hippie culture in the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s.\n\nWhen West Indian immigrants came to the UK in the 1950ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, they brought with them their music. In 1964, a group of mostly Trinidadian immigrants decided to throw an impromptu musical procession through the streets ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this would become LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Notting Hill Carnival.\n\nDuring the war the GIs introduced a whole new style of dancing: the Jitterbug - a wild and acrobatic jive which made the waltz and the foxtrot look dull and conservative.\n\nAmerica gave us rock ?n? roll. It was Chuck Berry, Elvis and Bill Haley who inspired the rock music that The Rolling Stones and The Who like to call their own.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary now recognises over 3,000 American words. Thanks to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“AmericanisationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ of our language and culture we have the USA to thank for the Big Mac, BLT, Apple Mac, chewing gum, gameshow, chatshow, and, of course, the cult of the celebrity.\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: 03 Infusion.avi\nFilesize.....: 400 MB (or 409,800 KB or 419,635,200 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:46:57 (70,417 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1055 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 129 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.96r\u0002Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯\nframe Size...: 416x318 (1.31:1) [~17:13]\n\nFor further details, please go to: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/history/mongrel_nation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discoverychannel.co.uk/history/mongrel_nation/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThanks and credit to the original capper and uploader.
