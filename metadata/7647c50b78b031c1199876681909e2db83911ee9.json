This force communicates again today as the world begins to enter a period of Spiritual Ascension with a new consciousness and awareness. This force refers to itself as Cosmic Awareness so that it cannot be confused with an entity or a personality. It has been communicating for more than 40 years through several carefully trained channels who go deep into trance and communicate the energies and symbols that are expressed, putting them into human language. As Cosmic Awareness reveals this information, it does not ask you to &quot;believe&quot; anything, but to question, explore, doubt and discover for yourself the Truth that is within you - to discover &quot;Who, In Fact, You Really Are.&quot;\n\n(Cosmic Awareness channelled message about this book follows:)\n\n&quot;The time has come to impart the Lessons Of Enlightenment, for the ushering in of the New Millennium. The lessons are offered to facilitate the unfolding of the New Age which symbolizes the restoration of humans to their intended evolutionary pathway to allow for the maximum evolution and expansion of Universal Consciousness. This is an era of renaissance through which entities can awaken from the sleep-inducing, dogmatic, and manipulative assertions of mankind and realign with the divine source of universal knowledge which lies within. \n\nIt is a time to celebrate the reconnection between the individual and the totality of All That Is. It is a time to become receptive to Divine Grace, to the love and faith that has been placed in humankind. It is a time to honor the faith, to acknowledge and reclaim the resources and abilities that empower humans rather than allow them to remain mired and enslaved within their own earthly illusions. It is a time for every soul to rise to the challenge of realigning the spirit, the will, the mind and the body. It is a time of joyous self expression.\n\nThe Lessons of Enlightenment provide the light, but it is the task of each individual to enlist the will and actively choose the pathway to receive the light. This requires the trust that each individual was created with - the innate capacity to know, to experience and attune to an inner guidance. This requires the courage to set aside those beliefs and habits of thought and action which now severely limit the soul, yet masquerade as the very truths for which humans feel compelled to fight and and die. For the feelings are indeed instrumental in such choices, but not without the understandings to be imparted in these Lessons.\n\nThe Lessons of Enlightenment will arrive like pearls of wisdom, for each to assemble into an invaluable adornment which can become an enduring talisman against external manipulation and will be a symbol of the choice for - and commitment to - individual empowerment, soul development; to individual, social and spiritual evolution; to love replacing fear; to light replacing darkness; to the rejection of evil; and to the unwavering faith in the Universal Divine. It is to be worn with honor, legitimate pride, dignity, compassion and self-respect. It cannot be worn if there is insincerity, a refusal to question existing beliefs, denial of spiritual impetus, denial of Will energy or violation or denial of others. For such denial not only negates the soul, but also denies the Universal Consciousness and each individual's rightful place in the connectedness of All That Is. \n\nThe actions of the wearer will always defy any such attempts at deception, for legitimate actions will always spring from a new motivative source, demonstrating the understanding, the awareness and the grace that the Lessons of Enlightenment embody. The actions of entities automatically provide testimony to the degree of alignment between Spirit, Will, Mind and Body. Indeed, upon grasping the understandings that the lessons provide, human essence, human nature, human behavior, human evolution and human destiny will all become far less mysterious. \n\nThis is a time of great potential and opportunity. This is a time for each entity to rise to the challenge of participation in the turning of the tide and in the laying of the groundwork for accelerated development. This is the time to realign with the Universal Divine, the Love Force, the Universal Consciousness of All That Is.&quot;\n\nLessons of Enlightenment Contents \n\n Alpha: Human Nature \nLesson One: Overview of The Human Condition \nIntroduction \nCommunication and the Fluid Creative Reality \nDisconnection and Rigid Physical Reality \nAttempts at Reempowerment \nThe Feeling System: A Spiritual Safety Net \nThe Task at Hand \nLesson Two: The Spiritual Nature Of Humankind \nHumanity as Spirituality as Divinity \nFrustrated Human Purpose and Evil \nNatural Morality \nThe Civilized Planet \nHuman Spirit: Consciousness and Intention \nConsciousness \nAltered States of Consciousness \nThe Illusory Fragmentation of Spirit and Will \nLesson Three: The Mental Nature Of Humankind \nEnter: The Realm of Mind \nThe Goal of Mind \nMental Tools Can Be Double-Edged \nThe Biblical Fall From Grace \nCurrent Mass Reality: The Mind of Man \nThe Divine Spiritual Safety Net \nLesson Four: The Physical Nature Of Humankind \nSpirit as Self in Physical Form \nHuman Emotion: An Undiscovered Sixth Sense \nFeelings and the Human Immune System \nFeelings Communicate Essential Spiritual Needs \nThe Individual (Power) Needs \nThe Group (Connection) Needs \nFeelings as Feedback Between Mind &amp;
