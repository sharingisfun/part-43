If you like the music, then pay your respects to the man here, make a comment. Just say &quot;Thank you, Papakeno&quot; - it's common courtesy to thank for that which is freely given!\nNot to mention that a simple &quot;Thank you, Papakeno&quot; will keep the man happy, and  working on these great music compilations for all of us.\n\nFor the rest of Papakeno's music (the PapaPop series), check out: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/papakeno/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/papakeno/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The%20Real%20Chicken/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/The%20Real%20Chicken/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlso check out the ISOTOP collection, created by _Wintermute_ - Very good music in similar style: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/_Wintermute_/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/_Wintermute_/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTorrent contains Strange Patterns 1-9, and EP 1&amp;2.\nSP9 and EP 1&amp;2 are complete with the bonus tracks added 2010.\n\n\nHappy Hunting\n\nThe REAL Chicken\n\nPS\nI work abroad, therefore I will disappear and re-appear at intervals (usually away 6 weeks, home 6 weeks). So if I'm not seeding right now, just be patient, I will return so you can get it downloaded.\nDS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2af866c13646e4f4bff44d2ff4709c6c1bc29af","amp;dn":"Strange+Patterns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2af866c13646e4f4bff44d2ff4709c6c1bc29af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,175,134,108,19,100,110,79,75,255,68,210,255,71,9,198,193,188,41,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
