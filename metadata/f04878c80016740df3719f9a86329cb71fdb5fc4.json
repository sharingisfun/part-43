The printers refused to print it, blaming the graphic language and controversial subject matter as a reason. The story remained in limbo until eventually being published as a graphic novel by Tundra with little, or no controversy. \n\nWritten by Peter Milligan, created and drawn by Brendan McCarthy and colored by Carol Swain.  Milligan has said the story partially addresses &quot;universal themes of major companies shafting people, and corruption in terms of drugs and mass marketing.&quot;  It remains one of Milligan's most powerful and acclaimed works.\n\nHardcore band Modern Life Is War based their song &quot;Martin Atchet&quot; on the comic.\n\n\nDue to the adult themes, language and violence this comes with an ADULT rating.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f04878c80016740df3719f9a86329cb71fdb5fc4","amp;dn":"Skin+%28Tundra+Publishing%29+ADULT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f04878c80016740df3719f9a86329cb71fdb5fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,72,120,200,0,22,116,13,243,113,159,154,134,50,156,183,31,219,95,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
