Each episode showcases two warriors in a hypothetical battle to the death. Each warrior brings weapons from the particular group they are associated with. Modern fighters and experts on said weapons present the strengths, and weaknesses of each arsenal, including real tests of the weapons. The data collected is then fed into a computer simulation based on an unreleased commercial game engine developed by Slitherine Strategies to determine the average winner of one thousand battles. After the winner is determined, a mock battle takes place to showcase how each weapon is used in a real battle situation, and to determine which combatant is the &quot;deadliest warrior&quot;. Geoff Desmoulin is the biomedical scientist and high speed camera operator. Dr. Armand Dorian is the medical consultant. Max Geiger is the simulations programmer. All three provide commentary throughout the show, as well as technical details of each weapons test. The show is narrated by Drew Skye according to the show's credits, . Season 2 will air in Spring 2010 with 13 episodes.\n\nDeadliest.Warriors.S02E01.720p.HDTV.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€264-aAF\n\nRELEASE DATEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..: 2010.04.21\nGENRE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦..: Docu\nx264 AC3\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-21624/episodes/1064916674/02ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€;02&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-21624/episodes/1064916674/02ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€;02&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSWAT vs. GSG-9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0442e25ff09d6205b618ee5c1387bf4aa237daf3","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Warrior+S02E01+720p+HDTV+x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0442e25ff09d6205b618ee5c1387bf4aa237daf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,66,226,95,240,157,98,5,182,24,238,92,19,135,191,74,162,55,218,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
