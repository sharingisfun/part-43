The\nrelease was largely successful, scoring the band a #3 peak in the UK and a\n#1 in the US, and became the world's first platinum-selling double album.\n\nThe album was also released as Wheels of Fire (In the Studio) and Wheels\nof Fire (Live at the Fillmore) as two single albums, released together, with\nsimilar cover art except: In the UK, the studio album was black print on\naluminium foil, while the Live at the Fillmore album was a negative image of\nthe studio cover. In Japan, the studio album was black on gold foil, while the\nlive album was black on aluminium foil. In Australia, both covers were\nlaminated copies of the Japanese releases (it was never released as a\ndouble album in Australia). In 2003, the album was ranked number 203 on\nRolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe sleeve was designed by Australian pop artist and cartoonist Martin\nSharp, who also designed the Disraeli Gears sleeve, and it won the New\nYork Art Directors Prize for Best Album Design in 1969.\n\n\n\n   1.
