The chapters are laid out nicely, guiding you through the various components of giving a speech as well as techniques on how to control your emotions. What I found most beneficial was the part on preparation. I was always too lazy to prepare and my instinct was to improvise, but this book showed me how to overcome that tendency and think about what I was going to say.\n\nIn all earnest, you don't need to read this book or any other book to become proficient in public speaking, but if a book helps you calm down and gather your courage, this book should be on your shelf.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f52389b3431726b68cc3c2e0e20a62ef18b52dc","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Idiot%5C%27s+Guide+to+Speaking+in+Public+With+Confidenc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f52389b3431726b68cc3c2e0e20a62ef18b52dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,82,56,155,52,49,114,107,104,204,60,46,14,32,166,46,241,139,82,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
