The only versions of the songs were on yuotube, however I did try to search elsewhere. I decided to &quot;rip&quot; them from yuotube as best I could and they turned out great imho. I recommend the songs &quot;The Cleansing&quot; and &quot;Girls in Neon&quot;. :)\n\n\n&quot;The Cleansing&quot;\n\n&quot;Girls in Neon&quot;\n\n&quot;This winter's almost over&quot;\n\n\nYou can take a listen atand if you like it you can go ahead and download the torrent.
