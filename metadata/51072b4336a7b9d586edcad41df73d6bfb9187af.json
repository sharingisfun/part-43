Not only are career-making songs like &quot;I'm Movin' On,&quot; &quot;Marriage Vow,&quot; and &quot;The Rhumba Boogie&quot; included, but so is a wealth of unreleased songs and alternate takes. For diehard Hank Snow fans, this first volume of The Singing Ranger series is the most essential of the three. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51072b4336a7b9d586edcad41df73d6bfb9187af","amp;dn":"Hank+Snow+-+The+Singing+Ranger%3A+1949-1953+%5B2002","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51072b4336a7b9d586edcad41df73d6bfb9187af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,7,43,67,54,167,185,213,134,237,202,212,29,247,61,107,251,145,135,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
