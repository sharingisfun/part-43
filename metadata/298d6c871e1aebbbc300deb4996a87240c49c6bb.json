It radiates the sense of freedom the pianist felt after John F.  Kennedy granted him a presidential pardon halfway through a ten-year sentence for substantial indiscretion.  The session made it plain that Hawes was still one of the most important pianists in jazz, as inventive as ever and with added richness in his harmonic structures.  Hawes heard special qualities in Dmitri TiomkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Green Leaves of Summer,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gave it one of his loveliest introductions, and made it a memorable jazz waltz.  The album has special treatments of pieces by Davis, Rollins, Arlen, and Berlin, and includes one of HawesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s custom-tailored blues. \n\nThis record HE recorded after HE get out of jail. . . GOD BLESS! Beautiful record!!!! ~ najponk\n\nI have had this album for years on vinyl and it is good to have it on CD, a fine addition to excellent 1955/56 trio sessions and the all night quartet session of 1956.  The usual selection of standards, jazz standards and blues.  Great.  ~ bothamsmith\n\nPersonnel:\nHampton Hawes - piano\nSteve Ellington - drums\nMonk Montgomery (Wes' brother) on bass\n\nHampton Hawes - The Green Leaves Of Summer Tracks:\n01  Vierd Blues\n02  The Green Leaves Of Summer\n03  Ill Wind\n04  St.  Thomas\n05  Secret Love\n06  Blue Skies\n07  The More I See You\n08  G.
