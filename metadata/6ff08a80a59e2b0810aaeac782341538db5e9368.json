While only the most rabid Judds fans will quibble about the absence of mother Naomi (other harmonizers take up the slack), some of the more important Judds hits (e.g., &quot;Why Not Me&quot;) go missing in favor of obscure offerings or covers. As always in concert, Wynonna's impassioned vocals are so robust and powerful as to seem a force of nature (take cover, Three Little Pigs!), and she can imbue a sentimental song like Dave Loggins's &quot;She Is His Only Need&quot; with enough grit and gravity to make it dig deep down in the bones. Unfortunately, she infuses her between-song prattle with history lessons on her musical journey, which wear thin on repeated listenings, despite some deeply vulnerable confessions and good-natured humor. (&quot;I'm trying to get back to my original weight: 8 pounds, 15 ounces.&quot;) She also fails to capture the frenetic randiness of Melissa Etheridge's &quot;I'm the Only One,&quot; and though a serious student of Elvis, her excursions into Presleyana (&quot;Burnin' Love,&quot; &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like Elvis&quot;) seem more like parody than anything else. Worse, the bonus studio track, &quot;Attitude,&quot; just sort of floats on by. On the upside, several songs rock harder and bluesier here than in their original versions, especially Mama Judd's blistering &quot;That Was Yesterday,&quot; and &quot;No One Else on Earth,&quot; which pushes its Bonnie Raitt-ish funk to the max. Bottom line: Mixed bag of material, but Wy's Ferrari of a voice will keep you glued to the speakers throughout.\n\n\n\nDisc 01 - Harmony &amp; History\n\n[01] Dream Chaser\n[02] A Girls Night Out\n[03] Love Is Alive\n[04] Maybe Your Baby's Got The Blues\n[05] Young Love\n[06] Let Me Tell You About Love\n[07] Love Can Build A Bridge\n[08] She Is His Only Need\n[09] Tell Me Why\n[10] No One Else On Earth\n[11] That Was Yesterday\n[12] I Want To Know What Love Is\n[13] Is It Over Yet\n\n     Disc 01 - Play Time - 01h:03m:54s\n\n\n\nDisc 02 - Motherhood &amp; Music\n\n[01] Shining Star\n[02] To Be Loved By You\n[03] Help Me\n[04] Don't You Throw That Mojo On Me\n[05] I'm The Only One\n[06] Sometimes I Feel Like Elvis\n[07] Burnin' Love\n[08] People Get Ready\n[09] I Can Only Imagine\n[10] What The World Needs\n[11] The Best\n[12] Peace In This House\n[13] When I Reach The Place I'm Going\n[14] Attitude (Bonus Track)\n\n     Disc 02 - Play Time - 01h:09m:26s\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 02h:13m:20s\n\nTotal Folder File Size\t- 307mb (Including mp3, Art Covers &amp; Booklet, word doc)\n\nTotal Mp3 Bit Rate \t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- LAME 3.96 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- No\n\nOriginal Uploader---------&gt;- Serker\n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Country\n\nOriginally Released\t- 27 September 2005\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Curb Records\n\nArtist Website\t\t- http://www.wynonna.com \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t- http://www.ilike.com/artist/Wynonna+Judd \n\t\t\t\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff08a80a59e2b0810aaeac782341538db5e9368","amp;dn":"%5B2005%5D+Her+Story+Scenes+From+A+Lifetime+-+Wynonna+Judd+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ff08a80a59e2b0810aaeac782341538db5e9368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,240,138,128,165,158,43,8,16,170,234,199,130,52,21,56,219,94,147,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
