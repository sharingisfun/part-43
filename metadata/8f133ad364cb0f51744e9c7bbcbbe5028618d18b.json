These films would be shown later at nearby fairgrounds, town halls and neighborhood theaters. Workers, school children, sports fans and seaside vacationers all flocked to see themselves miraculously captured on screen!\n\nThe astonishing discovery of the original Mitchell &amp; Kenyon negatives in Blackburn - in a basement about to be demolished - has been described as film\u0019s equivalent of Tutankhamen\u0019s tomb. Preserved and restored by the BFI National Film and Television Archive in collaboration with the University of Sheffield National Fairground Archive and featuring a hauntingly beautiful score by In The Nursery, this treasure trove of extraordinary footage provides an unparalleled record of everyday life in the years before World War I. Mesmerizing scenes of trolley cars and crowded streets, soccer matches, temperance parades, throngs of workers leaving the factory and a myriad of simple pleasures transport us to another - lost - world. The effect is as if H.G. Wells' marvelous time machine had come to life.\n\nThe main feature is broken up into five themes as detailed below. There are two tracks available for the audio.
