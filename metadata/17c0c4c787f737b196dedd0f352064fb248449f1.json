That's what I normally do.\nBut,for some reason I couldn't get the second subtitle file to display\non the video after joining them together.\nOkay, you say, split the video file in two and fit each subtitle file\nto each one of these parts.\nTrouble was Virtual Dub could not open the video file so I could split it.\nI've run into this before. One has to open it in Virtual Dub Mod and go\nthrough complitated conversion of various things. And it worked.\n\nI thought maybe someone else is stuck on this.\nSo, here it is in two separate parts which will play one after the other\nautomatically using KMPlayer just like they should.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c0c4c787f737b196dedd0f352064fb248449f1","amp;dn":"A+Tale+of+Two+Cities+%281935%29+with+ENG+SUBS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c0c4c787f737b196dedd0f352064fb248449f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,192,196,199,135,247,55,177,150,222,221,15,53,32,100,251,36,132,73,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
