But there are some annoying limitations that you should be aware of:\n\n   1. Windows allows you to lock files and folders on NTFS volumes only. FAT and FAT32 are not supported.\n   2. It is impossible to hide folder or file with standard Windows facilities. Only file and folder lock is possible.\n   3. There is no way to make folder invisible but accessible which is helpful for different security tasks like logging, private data recording, backing up etc.\n   4. A system administrator can easily get access to the locked folders and files.\n   5. Windows XP home edition doesn't have a user interface to protect files and folders.\n   6. There is no files and folders password protection in Windows (except the password you provide during Windows logon) - as soon as an authorized user authenticate himself by logging on, s/he get access to the protected files and folders. If you share your account with the another users then you can't exploit Windows folder protection features.\n\n\nProtection modes: Hide folder, Lock folder, Hide &amp; Lock folder, Read Only:\n===========================================================================\nHide - When you enable protection, the protected file or folder will not be visible to a user, but it will be possible to access it if you know the path to the object. This may be helpful when you want to hide application folders but allow to run the applications from these folders. E.g. you may hide Hide Folders 2009 application folder so nobody will know about it, but if you type from the command prompt &quot;C:Program FilesHide Folders 2009hf.exe&quot;, Hide Folders 2009 will run.\n\nLock - the protected file or folder will be visible but not accessible. It is similar to built-in protection of Windows NT-based operating systems on NTFS volumes. You can not use this protection method for Windows, System and Hide Folders 2009 application folders.\n\nHide &amp; Lock - The protected file or folder will not be visible to a user and it will not be possible to access them. You can not use this protection method for Windows, System32 and Hide Folders 2009 application folders.\n\nRead only - You can access the protected files and folders, but you cannot modify them. If you protect folder contents (using asterisk wildcard), you cannot copy files into the folder.\n\nNo protection - If you choose this method, your file or folder will remain unprotected.\n\n\nTrusted processes:\n===================\nSometimes you may want some &quot;trusted&quot; applications have access to the protected data. This may be helpful for antivirus and backup software. Hide Folders 2009 lets you set a list of trusted processes that have an unlimited access to the protected files and folders.\n\n\nNew password protection mechanism:\n===================================\nIt is very easy to protect files and folders with a password. Just specify your own password for opening Hide Folders 2009 and nobody but you will access your hidden files and folders! This password also protects Hide Folders 2009 from unauthorized uninstall. Unlike previous versions of Hide Folders software, it's impossible to reset the password using third-party tools.\n\n\nStealth mode - Hide a folder and nobody will know about it:\n============================================================\nIt is possible to remove all the tracks of Hide Folders 2009.\n\nWhen Hide Folders application is not running, hidden files and folders are invisible anyway. Moreover, you can remove your Hide Folders 2009 application folder and the hidden files and folders will stay invisible. Fantastic?!
