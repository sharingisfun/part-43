And from the start, her auburn-haired subject, a live wire in a restrictive society, muse of poets and crusaders, seduces the reader.\n\nWeir conveys a deep empathy for the relaxed south of France where Eleanor was raised, a natural home for the gospel of courtly love. She paints a Brueghelesque picture of England, where wolves roamed the forests and people made skates in winter out of animal bones.\n\nIn approaching as complex a subject as feudalism, Weir wears her learning lightly and has a pleasant habit of anticipating all the questions of a curious reader. Her account parades a sequence of extraordinary characters: the saintly abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, who as an adolescent leapt into a freezing pond until his erection subsided; Eleanor's first husband, Louis VII of France, haunted by the screams of burning victims after his assault on a village in Champagne; her lover, Raymond of Poitiers, who could bend an iron bar with his bare hands; and her second husband, Henry II of England, her princely mirror in energy, intelligence and sexuality. Above all, there is the heroine, viewed clear-sightedly in all her intoxicating and imperious irresistibility.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4429a98f4866d73ecaf93a11e0ce0aeee85786bc","amp;dn":"Alison+Weir+-+Eleanor+Of+Aquitaine+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4429a98f4866d73ecaf93a11e0ce0aeee85786bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,41,169,143,72,102,215,62,202,249,58,17,224,206,10,238,232,87,134,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
