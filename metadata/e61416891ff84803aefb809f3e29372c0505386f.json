Nobody would think this was a SPICE GIRL!!!! Melanie Chisholm \nfirst album is absolutely a very surprising album. You can notice is a debut \nalbum because there are so many styles in only 14 songs, but either way, you \ncan't think about that in her quality, not only the voice, but the type of songs. \nOut of her 5 singles, Melanie C has dare to do beautiful songs not so commercial \nlike &quot;Closer&quot;, &quot;Feel the sun&quot;, some of them more accoustical like &quot;Be the One&quot; or \n&quot;If that were me&quot;. You'll feel British sound in songs like &quot;Go!&quot; or &quot;Suddenly \nMonday&quot; (this one is absolutely Beatle-styled). With songs like &quot;Ga Ga&quot; or &quot;Goin' \nDown&quot; you'll detect a more rocky sound and she can even sing R'n'B with Left Eye \nin &quot;Never be the same again&quot;. THE BEST ALBUM OF 2000.
