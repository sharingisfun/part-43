That is the message from the founding father of modern medicine echoed in the controversial new documentary film Food Matters.\n\nWith nutritionally-depleted foods, chemical additives and our tendency to rely upon pharmaceutical drugs to treat what's wrong with our malnourished bodies, it's no wonder that modern society is getting sicker. Food Matters sets about uncovering the trillion dollar worldwide 'sickness industry' and gives people some scientifically verifiable solutions for overcoming illness naturally.\n\nInterviews with several world leaders in nutrition and natural healing who claim that not only are we harming our bodies with improper nutrition, but that the right kind of foods, supplements and detoxification can be used to treat chronic illnesses as fatal as terminally diagnosed cancer.\n\nThe focus of the film is in helping us rethink the belief systems fed to us by our modern medical and health care establishments. The interviewees point out that not every problem requires costly, major medical attention and reveal many alternative therapies that can be more effective, more economical, less harmful and less invasive than conventional medical treatments.\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nLanguage: English / Video Format: FLV\n\n************************************************************************************\n\nVisit us at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dreamingofheaven.com&lt;/a&gt;\n(To access our torrents click the &quot;Login&quot; link)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dacd4f99828501cedce41c0cab4cecd03f57cb","amp;dn":"Food+Matters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dacd4f99828501cedce41c0cab4cecd03f57cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,218,205,79,153,130,133,1,206,220,228,28,12,171,76,236,208,63,87,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
