It's set to classic just so I can ship it to anybody via snail mail and not have them freak out over the expanding start menu settings.\n\nThis is clean, no viruses according to MBAM, which is all I run, and all anybody should run (in a perfect world where people know how to remove them with just a mouse or kb and no internet).\n\n\n\n\n\nLong time listener, first time caller.\n\nThis is my very first contribution to TPB, I hope you like it!\n\n_DuctTapedGoat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c0d8365681096cb7169690b7888095643a01e8a","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+SP3+MVLK+SlipStreamed+w%2FWGA-FIX+%28Unattended%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c0d8365681096cb7169690b7888095643a01e8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,13,131,101,104,16,150,203,113,105,105,11,120,136,9,86,67,160,30,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
