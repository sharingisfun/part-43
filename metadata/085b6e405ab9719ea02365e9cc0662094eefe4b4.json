As with the previous game in the series, the player controls the protagonist Kyle Katarn, a former Jedi who cut his link with The Force after almost succumbing to the Dark Side. At the start of the game he is a mercenary working for the New Republic.[6]\n\nKyle is joined by other characters throughout the game. Three of the most prominent are Jan Ors, a fellow mercenary and love interest; Lando Calrissian (voiced by Billy Dee Williams), the sophisticated baron-administrator of Cloud City seen in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi;[15] and Luke Skywalker, protagonist of the original film trilogy and leader of the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. The player also receives help from Jedi and other New Republic soldiers.[16] Mon Mothma, Chief-of-State of the New Republic, gives Kyle and Jan objectives during the game.[17]\nThe primary antagonists of Jedi Outcast, Desann (right) and Tavion\n\nThere are four main antagonists: Desann, a former Jedi who killed a fellow student before leaving the Jedi Order;[18] Tavion, Desann's apprentice; Galak Fyyar, one of the leaders of the Imperial Remnant; and Reelo Baruk, a crime lord posing as a &quot;respectable garbage collector&quot; on Nar Shaddaa. They are supported by Imperial stormtroopers, numerous thugs and Dark Jedi.[19][/i][/b]\n[IMG]http://i586.photobucket.com/albums/ss301/g4m3fre4k/Jedi-Knight-2-Jedi-Outcast-Cheats-E.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i586.photobucket.com/albums/ss301/g4m3fre4k/jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-5.jpg[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i586.photobucket.com/albums/ss301/g4m3fre4k/jedi-knight-ii-jedi-outcast-1.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[b][color=red]Releaser's Notes:[/color][/b]\n[b]1.
