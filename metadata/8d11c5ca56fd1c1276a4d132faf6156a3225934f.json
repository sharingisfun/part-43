Episodes 01 - 17 were done by AHQ or Anime HQ, while the final 18 - 26 were done by A-S, or Anime Supreme.  \n\nAHQ did the best job by far, but only ripped the first 17 episodes.  Anime Supreme is considered the next best rip, followed by KAA or Kick Ass Anime (who messed up the frame blending and used a poor font.  Trigun was one of KAA's first DVD rips, and is not indicative of their typical quality), Anime-MX (suffering from poor resolution and overall quality control issues), P-A or Psychlo Anime (which is a train wreck), and finally RAX or Real Anime eXtreme (tons of ghosting and other screw-ups).\n\nI removed the English tracks from all of the episodes, and converted A-S's OGM files to MKV while making the Japanese language with English subtitles the default playback.  These are in Japanese with English subtitles only.\n\nAHQ uses ASS subtitles with their own font, while A-S uses SRT subtitles, so you may wish to change the font used with the A-S release away from the default style.\n\nI'll be seeding this for a few months on a 5mbps upload line, so a decent number of seeds should be found in a week or so.\n\nEnjoy the torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d11c5ca56fd1c1276a4d132faf6156a3225934f","amp;dn":"%5BAHQ+and+A-S%5D+Trigun+01+-+26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d11c5ca56fd1c1276a4d132faf6156a3225934f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,17,197,202,86,253,28,18,118,164,209,50,250,246,21,106,50,37,147,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
