With his family moving to a new home and one week before his birthday, the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a space ranger Buzz Lightyear action figure, whose impressive features soon see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody is disappointed and resentful at his replacement, while Buzz does not understand that he is a toy, believing himself to be a real space ranger, and sees Woody as an interference in his mission to return to his &quot;home planet&quot;. Andy's next door neighbor Sid Phillips has been kicked out of summer camp earlier and Woody explains to Buzz that Sid is a person who tortures and destroys toys just for fun.\nEncoded by: Vice @ HDScene RG\nEncode date: 1/2/2011\nFile size: 0.99GB\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Animation | Adventure | Comedy\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: MKV(.AVC)\nVideo Codec Type: X264\nAverage video bitrate: 1 314 Kbps\nMaximum video bitrate: 1 760 Kbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 850x368\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.175\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nSource: Toy.Story.1995.720p.BluRay.x264-BestHDThanks!\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: avc\nBitrate: 448 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz,\nChannel Count: 6 channels\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/9343/toystorymkvsnapshot0042.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/9343/toystorymkvsnapshot0042.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2058/toystorymkvsnapshot0034.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/2058/toystorymkvsnapshot0034.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nToy Story 2\n\nStoryline: Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy but his arm is ripped, forcing him to stay on the shelf. Later when Woody was put on the shelf, he finds a broken squeeze toy penguin toy named Wheezy, who is to be sold at a yard sale since his squeaker is broken. With help from Andy's dog, Buster, Woody sneaks out and saves Wheezy, but falls off before he can make it inside the house. He is eventually found by a greedy, enthusiastic toy collector who ends up stealing Woody when Andy's mother refuses to sell him.
