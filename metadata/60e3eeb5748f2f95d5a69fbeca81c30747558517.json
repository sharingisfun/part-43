His songs became more political in the 80s, most notably when he released the angry &quot;If I Had A Rocket Launcher&quot; after visiting a Guatamalan refugee camp on behalf of Oxfam. Though Cockburn has always been popular in his native Canada - he was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2001 - he has struggled to find an audience elsewhere, peaking with a No.21 placing in the US Hot 100 with 1979 single &quot;Wondering Where The Lions Are&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nBruce Cockburn - Electric &amp; acoustic guitars, harmonica, bodhran, windchimes, vocals\nFergus Jemison Marsh - Chapman stick, midi stick, background vocals\nMichael Sloski - Drums, percussion, background vocals\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
