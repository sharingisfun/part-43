Special bonus features include an interview with The Splinter Group, a European Tour film, Juke Box, discography and promo video for &quot;Real World.&quot;\n\nSplit into two halves, this concert from 2003 features former Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green and his Splinter Group performing both an acoustic and electric set. After leaving Fleetwood Mac, Green went through a well documented personal decline, but has re-emerged stronger than ever with the able backing of his backing band, Splinter Group. This concert features a stunning rendition of Fleetwood Mac's &quot;Albatross,&quot; as well as a selection of Splinter Group originals, and other covers. \nThe disc is in anamorphic widescreen with a fine Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack.\n\nTRACKLIST\n\nDVD\n\nACOUSTIC SET\nHitch Hiking Woman\nSweet Home Chicago\nDead Shrimp Blues\nCan You Tell Me Why (A.K.A.
