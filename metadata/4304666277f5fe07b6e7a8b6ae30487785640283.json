Captures passwords and all other invisible text.\n\n - Absolutely tiny and resource friendly. Only ~ 30Kb. Has never used more \n   than 0.2% CPU while I have been using it.\n\n - Can record all text which is copied to the clipboard \n   (whenever Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X etc is pressed).\n\n - Has an invisibility mode as well as user interface. Can be hidden on\n   startup. (Ctrl + Alt + F8 to restore visibility).\n\n - Undetectable to antivirus software (so far).\n\n - Can Pause and Resume when you don't want certain keystrokes recorded.\n\n - Will never attempt to connect to the internet. This keeps it invisible to \n   firewalls and means you can trust that it is never  sharing your logs with\n   others (as some cracked versions of commercial keyloggers do).\n\n - No installation necessary.\n\n - Still in development so any recommendations/requests will be built into \n   the next release\n\nHas been tested on Vista and XP and have not had any errors. If you like or dislike please leave a comment. I want to hear any recommendations you have. If there is enough interest I will add features such as uploading to an FTP site.\nPlease comment as it will let me know if I should continue or can this.\n\nHow to use:\n\n      - Move Steel.exe to desired location.\n      - Run Steel.exe.\n      - Choose save location under Options (or Ctrl+S). Default is in a log folder\n        in the same directory as Steel.exe.\n      - Select whether you want the application to startup with windows and\n        enable Hide on Startup if required.\n      - Use Ctrl+Alt+F8 to reshow the keylogger.\n      - Browse to log folder and open with notepad etc to view.\n\n\n\nLicense: &lt;a href=&quot; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/nz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCreated by _Smithy_\nNEWER VERSION OUT.
