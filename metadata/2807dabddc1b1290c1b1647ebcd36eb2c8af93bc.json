Lux aeterna &amp; Libera me\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem is a requiem mass written in memory of the composer's father, William Lloyd Webber, who died in 1982. Many thought it a surprising turn for such a populist composer as Lloyd Webber to produce a piece of &quot;serious&quot; music, being his first and to date only full-blown classical work. The music mixes Lloyd Webber's melodic and pop-oriented style with more complex, sophisticated and (at times) even austere forms. Lloyd Webber himself called the Requiem &quot;the most personal of all my compositions&quot;.\nThe work is scored for chorus, three soloists (tenor, soprano, treble) and a large orchestra that includes organ, drum kit, and synthesizer. It was written in 1984; its first performance featuring such major names Lorin Maazel, PlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cido Domingo, Sarah Brightman (Lloyd Webber's wife at the time) and Paul Miles-Kingston. The piece earned a largely negative critical reaction, many citing its lack of true depth and musical unity as examples of the weakness of the work. It is rarely performed today.\nThe best-known part of the piece, the &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; segment, was a minor &quot;hit&quot; and has been recorded frequently outside of the parent Requiem, including by Sarah Brightman.\nThe work won the 1986 Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2807dabddc1b1290c1b1647ebcd36eb2c8af93bc","amp;dn":"Andrew+Lloyd+Webber+-+Requiem+-+Flac+-+Abrasax+%28Working%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2807dabddc1b1290c1b1647ebcd36eb2c8af93bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,7,218,189,220,27,18,144,193,177,100,126,188,211,110,178,200,175,147,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
