It includes the latest advances in the field, as well as covering subjects from microscale heat transfer to thermophysical properties of new refrigerants. An invaluable guide to this most \ncrucial factor in virtually every industrial and environmental process.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nA single reference source covering all aspects of heat transfer problem-solving in engineering. Written by the most eminent engineering authorities in the field, this authoritative and comprehensive Handbook has now been completely revised and updated to include all the latest advances in heat transfer principals with special coverage of microscale heat transfer...heat transfer in materials processing...new heat transfer augmentation techniques...thermophysical properties of new refrigerants...innovative heat exchanger methods. The staff of expert contributors covers the essential heat transfer issues involved in every industrial and environmental process, as well as in energy production and transport. Designed to be the one and only source book the engineer needs, the Handbook presents key, fundamental subjects in condensed, readable form for on-the-job use. New findings in conduction, convection, radiation, and multi-phase heat transfer are also presented. The authors have kept the discussions of theory to a minimum, focusing more on a practical, hands-on-approach, to meet the day-to-day needs of engineers, designers, and technicians.\n\nProduct Details\nHardcover: 1344 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Professional; 3 edition (May 1, 1998)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0070535558\nISBN-13: 978-0070535558","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913d2a42fbf45a44e04262038d164f3512e47353","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Heat+Transfer+3rd+Edition%2C+Rohsenow%2C+Hartnett%2C+Cho","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913d2a42fbf45a44e04262038d164f3512e47353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,61,42,66,251,244,90,68,224,66,98,3,141,22,79,53,18,228,115,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
