How's this for attention?\n\nYou brought this upon yourself. You've tried to bite at the Anonymous hand, and now the Anonymous hand is bitch-slapping you in the face. You expected a counter-attack in the form of a verbal braul (as you so eloquently put it in one of your private emails), but now you've received the full fury of Anonymous. We award you no points.\n\nWhat you seem to have failed to realize is that, just because you have the title and general appearence of a &quot;security&quot; company, you're nothing compared to Anonymous. You have little to no security knowledge. Your business thrives off charging ridiclous prices for simple things like NMAPs, and you don't deserve praise or even recognition as security experts. And now you turn to Anonymous for fame and attention? You're a pathetic gathering of media-whoring money-grabbing sycophants who want to reel in business for your equally pathetic company.\n\nLet us teach you a lesson you'll never forget: you don't mess with Anonymous. You especially don't mess with Anonymous simply because you want to jump on a trend for public attention, which Aaron Barr admitted to in the following email:\n\n&quot;But its not about them...its about our audience having the right impression of our capability and the competency of our research. Anonymous will do what every they can to discredit that. and they have the mic so to speak because they are on Al Jazeeera, ABC, CNN, etc. I am going to keep up the debate because I think it is good business but I will be smart about my public responses.&quot;\n\nYou've clearly overlooked something very obvious here: we are everyone and we are no one. If you swing a sword of malice into Anonymous' innards, we will simply engulf it. You cannot break us, you cannot harm us, even though you have clearly tried...\n\nYou think you've gathered full names and home addresses of the &quot;higher-ups&quot; of Anonymous? You haven't. You think Anonymous has a founder and various co-founders? False. You believe that you can sell the information you've found to the FBI? False. Now, why is this one false? We've seen your internal documents, all of them, and do you know what we did? We laughed. Most of the information you've &quot;extracted&quot; is publicly available via our IRC networks. The personal details of Anonymous &quot;members&quot; you think you've acquired are, quite simply, nonsense.\n\nSo why can't you sell this information to the FBI like you intended? Because we're going to give it to them for free. Your gloriously fallacious work can be a wonder for all to scour, as will all of your private emails (more than 44,000 beauties for the public to enjoy). Now as you're probably aware, Anonymous is quite serious when it comes to things like this, and usually we can elaborate gratuitously on our reasoning behind operations, but we will give you a simple explanation, because you seem like primitive people:\n\nYou have blindly charged into the Anonymous hive, a hive from which you've tried to steal honey. Did you think the bees would not defend it? Well here we are. You've angered the hive, and now you are being stung.\n\nIt would appear that security experts are not expertly secured.\n\nWe are Anonymous.\nWe are legion.\nWe do not forgive.\nWe do not forget.\nExpect us - always.\n\n---\n\nQuick 'n dirty way to read the emails in a human-readable format:\n1. Get a client. http://www.mozillamessaging.com/thunderbird/\n2. Get a file renaming tool. http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php (Windows)\n3. Rename all the mail files so that they have a .eml extension.\n4. Drag &amp; drop them into Thunderbird.\n5. Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f3e245a264226ab1763d16a5ae4098a4d98d42","amp;dn":"HBGary+leaked+emails","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f3e245a264226ab1763d16a5ae4098a4d98d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,243,226,69,162,100,34,106,177,118,61,22,165,174,64,152,164,217,141,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
