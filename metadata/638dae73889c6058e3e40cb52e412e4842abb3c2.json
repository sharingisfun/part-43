These aspects include: protecting schools, cadet training, peacekeeping, ERT, remote policing, drug labs, youth policing, frontline policing, VIPs etc.\n\nEpisode Info: Police officers are in a unique position to play an important role in the lives of youth. Constables Lois Cormier and Earl Woods are devoted to working with youth and making a huge difference in their communities. Lois is a Community Relations Officer in Thompson, Manitoba, working to stem gang violence and chronic drug abuse. Earl Woods is a School Resource Officer in Souris, PEI. His influence has been profound in reducing youth crime in his community. Whether it's dealing with victims, offenders, parents or advisors, these exceptional stories of dedication reflect the RCMP's desire to connect with and relate to youth.\n\n\nThe resolution is 608x352 and the quality is quite watchable in my opinion. \n\nThe website for this show is here: http://courageinred.ca/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638dae73889c6058e3e40cb52e412e4842abb3c2","amp;dn":"Courage.in.Red.S01E08.Youth.Programs.WS.XviD-err0001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638dae73889c6058e3e40cb52e412e4842abb3c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,141,174,115,136,156,96,88,227,228,12,181,46,65,46,72,66,171,179,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
