This documentary takes the viewer off the beaten path, far from any \ntourist attractions and sandy beaches; yet it is still able to capture the beauty and magic \nthat the Island has to offer. From the deep countryside to the whirlwind ghettos of Kingston, \nno matter where you are, the film makes it evident that music is the heartbeat of the culture.\nIn a society where talent abounds and opportunity is scarce, Rise Up follows the very different \nlives of three artists struggling in their own unique way for their big break at stardom. \nTurbulence, the conscious ghetto youth with enough determination to move mountains; Ice, \nthe young faux-gangster dancehall artist from the upper class; and Kemoy, the beautifully \ninnocent country girl who barely realizes her amazing vocal gifts - their stories unfold as \nthe film seamlessly interweaves their lives behind the backdrop of the bustling underground \nreggae scene of Jamaica. Five years in the making, Rise Up is able to capture the pure artistry \nand creativity of these three musicians in raw form while at the same time, able to bring the viewer \ninto their personal lives, inside their most private moments, as they struggle to find their voice and \ndiscover their ability to overcome life's obstacles.\n\nProgram infomation From The BBC*\n\nRipping &amp; Transfer &amp; Dvd Creation, \nDvd Title Music, Dvd Information , Screenshot's, \nAnd Distribution By Sean A.k.a Soul Rebel\n\nIssued Too :www.marleyandtoshtorrents.net\nDate Off Issue:18th February 2011\n\nMD5 Included.\n\nDo Not Remove These Notes\nKeep It Lossless \nKeep A Seed\nShare It Freely\nDo Not Use For Tradeing\nThis Is Issued As Free\nAs Your Getting Now.\nFree !\n\nThat Is All I ask Of You !!\nThank You !!\nAnd\nEnjoy !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65ed5e5c76c75a57267aea5e24abe30926243598","amp;dn":"BBC+Four+-+Storyville+2009-2010+Rise+Up+Reggae+Star+Documentry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65ed5e5c76c75a57267aea5e24abe30926243598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,237,94,92,118,199,90,87,38,122,234,94,36,171,227,9,38,36,53,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
