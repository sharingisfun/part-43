It marked the start of a controversial five-album collaboration between Thompson and new producer Mitchell Froom that was regarded, in some quarters, to have &quot;Americanised&quot; and commercialised Thompson's style and sound. The album is variously seen as a sell-out under pressure from a record company, or as an attempt to reach a wider audience.\n\nIt also saw a shift, with songs like &quot;A Bone Through her Nose&quot;, &quot;Baby Talk&quot; and &quot;Valerie&quot;, in Thompson's songwriting away from the seemingly personal and towards the character portraits for which he has become renowned. &quot;Al Bowlly's In Heaven&quot; and &quot;How Will I Ever Be Simple Again&quot; are two of Thompson's best loved songs and concert staples, the latter also one of the more frequently covered Thompson songs.\n\n Track listing\nAll songs written by Richard Thompson\n\n&quot;A Bone Through Her Nose&quot; \n&quot;Valerie&quot; \n&quot;Missie How You Let Me Down&quot; \n&quot;Dead Man's Handle&quot; \n&quot;Long Dead Love&quot; \n&quot;Lover's Lane&quot; \n&quot;Nearly In Love&quot; \n&quot;Jennie&quot; \n&quot;Baby Talk&quot; \n&quot;Cash Down, Never Never&quot; \n&quot;How Will I Ever Be Simple Again&quot; \n&quot;Al Bowlly's In Heaven&quot; \n\n Personnel\nRichard Thompson - guitar, vocals, mandolin, dulcimer, theremin \nMitchell Froom - keyboards, theremin \nJerry Scheff - bass guitar, double bass \nMickey Curry - drums \nJim Keltner - drums \nAlex AcuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±a - percussion \nChristine Collister and Clive Gregson - backing vocals \nJohn Kirkpatrick - accordion, concertina \nPhilip Pickett - shawm, crumhorn, recorder and symphony. \nChuck Fleming - fiddle \nBrian Taylor, Tony Goddard, David Horn, Ian Peters - brass \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76f4b1647ca0f13051fb11fb223c10f453e34eac","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson...Daring+Adventures%281986%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76f4b1647ca0f13051fb11fb223c10f453e34eac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,244,177,100,124,160,241,48,81,251,17,251,34,60,16,244,83,227,78,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
