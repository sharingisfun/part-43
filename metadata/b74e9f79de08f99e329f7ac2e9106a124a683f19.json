While giving you those insights, you learn where and how to use the features to design various kinds of software. This book not only teaches the languageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capabilities, it also looks behind the scenes to build a solid foundation to aid you in understanding the .NET platform as a whole.\n\nBart De Smet offers exceptional insight into the features of both the language and MicrosoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s broader framework. He doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just cover the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of effective C# programming: He explains the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwhy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ so you can consistently choose the right language and platform features, maximizing your efficiency and effectiveness.\nThe early chapters introduce the .NET platform, the tooling ecosystem, and the C# programming language, followed by in-depth coverage of the C# programming language itself, with immediate application of language features. The last chapters give an overview of the .NET Framework libraries about which every good developer on the platform should know.\n\n* Understand the .NET platform: its language support, libraries, tools, and more \n* Learn where C# fits, how it has evolved, and where itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s headed\n* Master essential language features including expressions, operators, types, objects, and methods \n* Efficiently manage exceptions and resources \n* Write more effective C# object-oriented code \n* Make the most of generics, collections, delegates, reflection, and other advanced language features \n* Use LINQ to express queries for any form of data \n* Master dynamic programming techniques built on .NETÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) \n* Work with namespaces, assemblies, and application domains \n* Write more efficient code using threading, synchronization, and advanced parallel programming techniques \n* Leverage the Base Class Library (BCL) to quickly perform many common tasks \n* Instrument, diagnose, test, and troubleshoot your C# code\n\n===================================================================================\n***********************************************************************************\n**********In order to keep files alive please seed until a ratio of 1:1************\n****************************Thank you ~ Oceanhawk :)*******************************\n***********************************************************************************\n===================================================================================\n\n\nPS: If you have an ORIGINAL (non \\&quot;for dummies\\&quot;) E-book request Feel free to post\nit below.
