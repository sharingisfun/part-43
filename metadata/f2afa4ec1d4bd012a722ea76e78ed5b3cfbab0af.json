Paco (Tony Musante), is disguised as a clown as he performs for an audience. The Mercenary opens and closes is a similar fashion like Corbucci's CompaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±eros where the first scene of the movie is the last scene that dissolves into a flashback that comes full circle at the end of the film. Paco is a dimwitted peasant who with the help of his comrades they try to over throw the Mexican Government. Kowalski (Franco Nero), is a Polish gunfighter that Paco hires to help him in his quest. Along the way Paco clashes with Ricciolo (Jack Palance), who is hell bent on exacting his revenge against Paco. Things start to go wrong for Paco and Kowalski when they clash over strategies and beautiful Columba (Giovanna Ralli), who has plans of her own.\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
