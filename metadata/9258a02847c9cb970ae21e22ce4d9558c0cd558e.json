Reconnect to the internet.\n\n\n*DON'T FREAK OUT; 90% OF THE FILES ARE SMALL EXTENSIONS*\n\n\nCS4 is one of the most extensive and useful collection of programs to date. If you \n\nneed it - CS4 has it. I cannot  stress this enough: ****DISCONNECT FROM THE \n\nINTERNET BEFORE AND DURING INSTALLATION**** I don't need idiots doing this wrong  \n\nthen criticizing my torrent when it's their brain that doesn't work. It's also \n\nextremely useful to block these programs from web access using your firewall. The \n\nkeygen is inside and, no, it is not a virus, so don't delete it! \n\n- ThE Professional","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9258a02847c9cb970ae21e22ce4d9558c0cd558e","amp;dn":"Adobe+CS4+Master+Collection+%28Bought+on+the+Adobe+website%29+-ThE+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9258a02847c9cb970ae21e22ce4d9558c0cd558e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,88,160,40,71,201,203,151,10,226,30,34,206,77,149,88,192,205,85,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
