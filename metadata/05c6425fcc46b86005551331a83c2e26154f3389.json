Goodness Gracious \n\nNewly relocated to the pacific northwest and fresh off their recent US tour with Clem Snide, Chris this time teamed up with Chicago psych-folk band Ulysses S. Grant just long enough to have a few parties and interpret a record in summer 2009. The new collaboration has been wild and exciting, fusing meticulously worded songs and spaced-out jams to make the most interesting Heligoats listen yet. Live the songs are dynamic and energetic, building sonic force around Otepka's acoustic-based tunes, adding colorful settings to the stories within and fleshing out the universe of this recording. And universe is apt; with each track its own little world, all 10 songs come together to take the listener out on wild safari and have them home by dinner.\n\n\n\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/13/heligoats/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/13/heligoats/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05c6425fcc46b86005551331a83c2e26154f3389","amp;dn":"The+Heligoats...Goodness+Gracious%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05c6425fcc46b86005551331a83c2e26154f3389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,198,66,95,204,70,184,96,5,85,19,49,168,60,46,38,21,79,51,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
