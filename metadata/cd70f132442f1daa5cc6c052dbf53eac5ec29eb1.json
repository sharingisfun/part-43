By changing the System Registry and optimizing the TCP/IP parameters, SpeedConnect can fine-tune the values to take advantage of more reliable, faster Internet connections.\n\nPC Magazine Review\n&quot;CBS Software's SpeedConnect Internet Accelerator tops overall.&quot;\n\n&quot;Top 10 Internet Accelerators&quot; PC World &amp; CNN Computing\n&quot;SpeedConnect accelerator prevents fragmentation in data transfer and optimizes your Windows TCP/IP settings for faster Web browsing, e-mail, and downloads.&quot;\n\nWebAttack Review\n&quot;If you are bothered by slow connection speed, SpeedConnect is a safe, fast and inexpensive way to optimize your system settings.&quot;\n\nInternetADVISOR Review\n&quot;SpeedConnect can automatically work out the best way to squeeze that extra bit of speed out of your computer's Internet connection.&quot;\n\nZDNet Review\n&quot;...in a few words: Easy to use, AOL adapter support, Excellent online help, LAN and DUN support&quot;\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nSpeedConnect prevents fragmentation in data transfer using the TCP/IP protocols used on the Internet, greatly increasing the connection throughput and the download/upload speeds (Kbps).\n\nBecause Windows default network settings have general values and are not optimized for a specific internet connection type, SpeedConnect software calculates, optimize and safely change several network related settings to known optimized values, in a recursive process, until it discovers the best settings for your specific connection.
