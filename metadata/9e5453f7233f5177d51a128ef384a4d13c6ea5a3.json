Instead of songs being about love and loss, Mike embraces the here and now; he looks to the future and sings about aspiration and dreams. This attribute is admirable and make you appreciate his songs more. Dignam has an eclectic collection of songs which musically are superb and blend beautifully with his vocal talent. I would put Mike Dignam along side artists such as John Mayer and Newton Faulkner and it would be fair to say he is Preston's own Jack Johnson he is truly a force to be reckoned with, and without a doubt a bright young star to be watched with open eyes.&quot; \n\n -from one of Mike's blogs\n\n\n\nhis album contains:\n\n1.  Slow it Down\n2.  Someone Better\n3.  World of Our Own\n4.  Do You Even Know\n5.  Don't You Dare\n6.  So Wrapped Up\n7.  Unwritten Rule\n8.  Anything\n9.  Everything Changed\n10.
