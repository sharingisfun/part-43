And this is the enjoyment Tallahassee, Fla.-based band Only Thieves provides on its debut album, Heartless Romantics. This is an album that strikes a note that makes you want to raise the volume. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a raucous rocker of an album, one that you would headbang or mosh to. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one that sounds powerful and emotional enough to warrant playing loudly just to enjoy it even more. There are guitar fuzz and snappy snare hits ala Silversun Pickups and the precision and harmony that make Interpol so good. And you can feel the indie-punk energy of Gaslight Anthem on songs like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlood Lights.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s even a Manchester Orchestra-esque dirty sound to some songs. And when singer Jeremy Barnes reaches back and really wails, he sounds a bit like Andy Hull. And like many good albums, this Heartless Romantics closes out with grandiose closer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wrong,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a song that approaches six minutes but never feels like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that long. That may sound like a lot of different things rolled into one, but it really doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seem like an overflowing melting pot. The songs flow well into each other. This is a hook-laden album that sounds polished, yet rough around the edges enough to not dull the blade that is the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s energy and emotion. While Barnes yells late on the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI love being unsatisfied,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ this album as a whole provides the opposite feeling; not only are you satisfied from start to finish, you want a second helping.\n\nEncompassing all the ethos of those torch-bearing bands of our youth - The Replacements, Superdrag and Buffalo Tom to name a few - Only Thieves blends that classic power-pop sound with the ingenuity and modifications that outfits like the Gaslight Anthem and Lemuria have poured into today's punk and indie genres. There is an undefinable style and substance, not to mention a dynamic progression that when done right, makes driving, hook-filled rock sound absolutely timeless. Heartless Romantics is a record that is truly nostalgic without seeming retro, but it's also modern without sounding polished. \n\nMembers:\n\nJeremy Barnes - Guitar with Vocals\n\nThomas Bacot - Bass with Additional Vocals\n\nAubrey Young - Drums\n\nMarc Zivica - Additional Guitar and does some Vocals\n\n\nHometown:Tallahassee, FL\n    \nRecord Label:unsigned\n    \nCurrent Location:Tallahasee, FL\n\n    \nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.All The Sad Young Men\n02.Discoveries\n03.Flood Lights\n04.Register\n05.Pioneer Repair\n06.The Ballad Of The Aluminum Girl\n07.Heartless Romantic\n08.Unsatisfied\n09.Bricks\n10.What's Wrong\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b54d38b144f3c863f474f5a85765bd3810f58b7","amp;dn":"Only+Thieves+-+Heartless+Romantics+%282011%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b54d38b144f3c863f474f5a85765bd3810f58b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,84,211,139,20,79,60,134,63,71,79,90,133,118,91,211,129,15,88,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
