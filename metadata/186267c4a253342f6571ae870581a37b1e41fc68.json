Peter immediately sets out to rectify the situation, embarking on a series of bizarre and awkward man-dates, before meeting Sydney Fife (Jason Segel, Forgetting Sarah Marshall), a charming, opinionated man with whom he instantly bonds. But the closer the two men get, the more Peters relationship with Zooey suffers, ultimately forcing him to choose between his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and his new found bro, in a story that comically explores what it truly means to be a friend.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAVI File\n\nWidth: 624\nHight: 352\nFramerate: 23 f/ps\nAudio: 120 kbps\nLength: 01:44:46\nGenre: Comedy\nTagline: Are You Man Enough To Say It?\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\n\n* John Hamburg\n\n\n\nCast:\n\n* Paul Rudd\n* Rashida Jones\n* Sarah Burns\n* Greg Levine\n* Jaime Pressly\n\n\nTrailer:\n\nTrailer (Flash) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cinema.nl/media/4610305/trailer-i-love-you-man-van-john-hamburg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cinema.nl/media/4610305/trailer-i-love-you-man-van-john-hamburg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrailer (Windows Media Player) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mejane.com/trailers/play/11726/I_Love_You,_Man.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mejane.com/trailers/play/11726/I_Love_You,_Man.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrailer (Quicktime) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/iloveyouman/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/iloveyouman/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\nIMDB User Rating: 7.8/10 (13,056 votes) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155056/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155056/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnglish subtitles added as .SRT file.
