It extends the          \n      ability of Phantom CD by adding burner emulation. It      \n       not only allows you to mount disc image files as            \n       virtual CD, DVD or Blu-ray discs, but also let you          \n        create disc image files by burn to the virtual            \n        CD-R/DVD+RW/DVD-RAM/BD-RE burner drive, from using any  \n         disc burning software.                                   \n                                                                  \n         * Usage                                                  \n                                                                   \n         Many people understand the benefits of using disc            \n       image files (like ISO) instead of real optical discs.       \n        It is cheaper, faster, and you don't need to worry        \n        about scratches or the storage of discs.                \n                                                                  \n         However, not all burning software supports disc image    \n         file creation. Use Phantom Burner instead. It is a       \n        virtual CD/DVD/Blu-ray burner, and allows you to           \n         create disc images from any burning software.                \n                                                                   \n        * Audio CD Support                                        \n                                                                \n         This is the easiest way to create disc images for        \n         audio CD's.                                              \n                                                                  \n        Even if a burning software supports disc image             \n         creation, most likely it only supports data discs.           \n       Very few burning software support disc images for           \n        audio CD's.                                               \n                                                                \n         Phantom Burner allows you to burn virtual audio CD       \n         from any burning software.                               \n                                                                  \n                                                                   \n                                                                      \n                                                                    \n                                                            \n                                              \n                                              \n                                        \n                                           \n                             \n                             \n       [   RELEASE INFO   ]    \n          \n                          \n                                              \n                                                              \n                                                                 \n                                                           \n                                                          \n     1.

It is however,       \n       time that  the scene  itself starts  embracing some of     \n         this change aswell,  instead of  dwelling on the past.    \n        Because of this,  we would like to ask  all our fellow  \n         sceners to consider the following:                       \n                                                                    \n          STOP FLOODING OUR SITES WITH CRAP!    We have enforced    \n          a 1-month MU  rule on our  own releases,  and we would    \n          like  YOU  to follow our  lead.  Everyone is  tired of    \n          releasing/testing/trading  the same releases over  and    \n          over again, and it's up to *us*  to change this. There    \n          are plenty of uncracked, useful applications out there,   \n          begging for some attention.  So stop wasting your time    \n          on crap just because it updates a lot and it serves in    \n          boosting  the number of  releases your group does.  We    \n          know  that we've done  similar things in the past,  as    \n          most groups, but this doesnt dismiss the truth in this    \n          message, its never too late to change.                    \n                                                                    \n          In  light of  this same issue,  we would also  like to    \n          encourage  everyone to  TEST  your  releases! We spend    \n          *a lot* of time to make sure everything we pre  WORKS,    \n          and so should you! Remember, *WE* ARE the SCENE and we    \n          SHOULD enforce some standards on ourselves!               \n                                                                    \n          You don't agree?
