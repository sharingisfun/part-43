Such systems typically consist of a heterogeneous collection of processors, specialized memory subsystems, and partially programmable or fixed-function components. This heterogeneity, coupled with issues such as hardware/software partitioning, mapping, scheduling, etc., leads to a large number of design possibilities, making performance debugging and validation of such systems a difficult problem.\n\nEmbedded systems are used to control safety critical applications such as flight control, automotive electronics and healthcare monitoring. Clearly, developing reliable software/systems for such applications is of utmost importance. This book describes a host of debugging and verification methods which can help to achieve this goal.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Covers the major abstraction levels of embedded systems design, starting from software analysis and micro-architectural modeling, to modeling of resource sharing and communication at the system level;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Integrates formal techniques of validation for hardware/software with debugging and validation of embedded system design flows;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Includes practical case studies to answer the questions: does a design meet its requirements, if not, then which parts of the system are responsible for the violation, and once they are identified, then how should the design be suitably modified?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1790775439ffc4a7d9e36da0ea7f846607492aff","amp;dn":"Embedded+Systems+and+Software+Validation+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1790775439ffc4a7d9e36da0ea7f846607492aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,144,119,84,57,255,196,167,217,227,109,160,234,127,132,102,7,73,42,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
