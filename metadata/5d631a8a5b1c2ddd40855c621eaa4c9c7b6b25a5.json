The series is published by Dark Horse Comics and previously by Image Comics.\n\nHeath Huston is the last Fear Agent, a task force dedicated to eradicating alien threats to their home planet, Earth. A Mark Twain-studying redneck from Texas, Heath spends his days as a borderline alcoholic conversing with Annie, the A.I. system of his spaceship.\n\nThe series is notable for its emphasis on action, adventure, horror, and plot twists rather than realism or scientific detail; Remender claims in the first issue that &quot;science fiction has lost its stones&quot; and that Fear Agent is his attempt to fight that trend. \n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d631a8a5b1c2ddd40855c621eaa4c9c7b6b25a5","amp;dn":"Fear+Agent+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d631a8a5b1c2ddd40855c621eaa4c9c7b6b25a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,99,26,138,91,28,45,221,64,133,92,98,30,170,76,156,123,107,37,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
