This 1974 duo session with bassist Red Mitchell, which focuses exclusively on the works of Cole Porter, is one great example. With an inventive accompanist like Mitchell spurring him on, the alto saxophonist is able to work magical variations of the familiar Porter works, while Konitz retains his remarkable dry signature tone. &quot;Easy to Love&quot; has a bit of a bittersweet air in his hands, as does the more deliberate &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye.&quot; Mitchell is a bit more subdued in the hip treatment of &quot;'You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,&quot; as Konitz's intricate improvisation works its magic. The usually over the top &quot;Love for Sale&quot; features an understated arrangement here. Mitchell switches to piano for &quot;Night and Day,&quot; playing a soft bop line behind the leader. Three alternate takes were added for the 1987 CD reissue of this 1974 session, which will have great appeal to fans of Lee Konitz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8560b0099a59301d6e2cee7cdfe60eabe7ea6f","amp;dn":"LEE+KONITZ+%26+RED+MITCHELL+-+1974+-+I+concentrate+on+you%5Bjazz%5D%5Bmp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8560b0099a59301d6e2cee7cdfe60eabe7ea6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,133,96,176,9,154,89,48,29,110,44,238,124,223,230,14,171,231,234,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
