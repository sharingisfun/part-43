Although she wouild have preferred to study art, she studied pharmacy in Lausanne. She finished her studies in 1948.\n\nErnest Ansorge was born in Lausanne on 28 February 1925. He hated his first name, choosing instead the nickname Nag, which originated from his early days as a boy scout. Nag studied at Lausanne's Ecole Polytechnique Universitaire and graduated as an engineer in 1951.\n\nNag met GisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le and the couple became increasingly interested in the cinema. They decided to make marionette films after seeing Jiri Trnka's famous Czech Legends.The couple married and settled in Zurich in 1952, where Nag was already working as a mechanical engineer. Zurich at the time was a hub of film creation in Switzerland; this influenced the Ansorges' decision to enter film making.\n\nNag spent time working with mental patients at Cery Hospital between 1961 and 1981. The patients worked on both animated and live films with him. This contact provided the couple with much of their unique stream of conscious, surreal subject matter.\n\nExtract from article Animated Films In Psychiatry\nThe Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Lausanne\nCery Hospital, 1962-1981 by Nag Ansorge\n\nIn 1962, I had just finished filming a documentary about the new buildings of the Cery Psychiatric Hospital near Lausanne, Switzerland when Professor Muller suggested the idea of acquiring a 16 mm camera for his patients.\n\n&quot;What could you do with a camera and some patients?&quot; he asked me. A little infatuated with the idea, I said, &quot;I'm going to try to do something... The experiment interests me. How will I introduce myself to a group of patients that I don't know at all?&quot; However, I have to say that after the first 30 seconds, my infatuation was satisfied. I asked the first group of patients, &quot;Do you have anything to say or show by means of a camera?&quot; There was hardly a moment of silence. They all suddenly said, &quot;Yes, there's something to say.&quot; My experiment lasted 19 years. Thirteen films were made, from 10 to 20 minutes in length, of which eight were animated.\n\nA Life Altering Experience\nOn a personal level, this activity was a revelation for me. Since I didn't represent any medical authority, my relationship with the patients gradually became very direct and friendly. The way in which the patients analyzed things and made judgments allowed me to learn to know myself better. I discovered a world profoundly human, which had to work with very great suffering, the intensity of which is hard to imagine.\n\nThese films should not arouse compassion, but rather an interest and a sense of active conscience in the face of the mystery of mental illness. The discovery of this thrilling milieu has certainly greatly influenced the themes treated in the films GisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨le, my wife, and I made.\n\n\n1967 - Les Corbeaux\n1969 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fantasmatic\n1970 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Alunissons\n1975 - Le Chat CamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on\n1975 - Smile 1\n1975 - Smile 2\n1975 - Smile 3\n1977 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Anima\n1982 - Das Veilchen\n1984 - Les enfant de Laine\n1988 - Le Petit GarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§on que Vola la Lune\n1991 - Sabbat ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:416e4d8a23dde53cb322ab111a872e466f094f95","amp;dn":"Gisele_and_Ernst_Ansorge_VVAA_Sand_Animations_-_1967-1991","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"416e4d8a23dde53cb322ab111a872e466f094f95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,110,77,138,35,221,229,60,179,34,171,17,26,135,46,70,111,9,79,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
