Augmented by well-known artists from across South and \nLatin America, the Yes vocalist seems content to recede into the background on \nmany of the tracks, retaining a native flavor with stellar cameos from Maria \nConchita Alonso, Boca Livre, Milton Nascimento, and many others. The songs, \nwhich generally clock in around three-and-a-half minutes, are warm and upbeat, \nmixing English, Portuguese, and Spanish vocals with propulsive percussion, \nacoustic guitars, bass, and synthesizers. The melodies are lovely and \natmospheric, uncomplicated but evocative. The best tracks don't necessarily \nfeature Anderson in a starring role: &quot;A-DE-O,&quot; &quot;Bridges,&quot; &quot;Danca Do Ouro,&quot; and \n&quot;CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©&quot; feature the vocalist in a supporting role, but listeners may find \nthemselves too entranced by the beautiful harmonies to notice his absence. While \nthe singer does take center stage on a number of songs with pleasant results -- \n&quot;This Child,&quot; &quot;Floresta,&quot; and especially &quot;Bless This&quot; (with Deborah Anderson) -- \na few tracks leave Anderson exposed, notably the lightweight &quot;Latino&quot; and the \nill-advised posturing of the opening &quot;Amor Real.&quot; However, these occasional \nmissteps are easily overlooked in lieu of the disc's innumerable charms. The \nartist had experimented with world sounds on earlier albums with his Yes mates \n-- &quot;Teakbois&quot; from Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe and &quot;Angkor Wat&quot; from Union \ncome to mind -- but Deseo marks a genuine willingness to step outside of his own \nidiom. Thus, the connection between Jon Anderson and the music on Deseo isn't \nalways clear, but the singer wisely shares his sense of discovery with the \nlistener, allowing the music (and not the musician) to shine. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bd93ba8755f03fd5082df26a161c8e27a801a87","amp;dn":"Jon+Anderson+-+Deseo+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bd93ba8755f03fd5082df26a161c8e27a801a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,217,59,168,117,95,3,253,80,130,223,38,161,97,200,226,122,128,26,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
