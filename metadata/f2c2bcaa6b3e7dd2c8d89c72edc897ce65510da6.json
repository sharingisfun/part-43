He was also referred to as Blind Snooks Eaglin in his early years.\nHis vocal style is reminiscent of Ray Charles; indeed, in the 1950s, when he was in his late teens, he would sometimes bill himself as &quot;Little Ray Charles&quot;. Generally regarded as a New Orleans R&amp;B artist, he played a wide range of music: blues, rock and roll, jazz, country, and Latin. In his early years, he also played some straight-ahead acoustic blues.\nHis ability to play a wide range of songs and make them his own earned him the nickname &quot;the human jukebox.&quot; Eaglin claimed in interviews that his musical repertoire included some 2,500 songs\nAt live shows, he did not usually prepare set lists, and was unpredictable, even to his bandmates. He played songs that came to his head, and he also took requests from the audience.\n\n\nTracklist\n1. Can You Hear Me? 4:32\n2. Boogie Rambler 5:13\n3. Lock Doctor 4:33\n4. Trees 4:43\n5.
