Volumes one and three were mostly traditional songs; these are all traditional songs in the public domain. It follows that if you liked volumes one and three, you'd probably like this too; if you want to choose just one, you're about as well off with any of the individual volumes. If you had to split hairs, it seems that Anderson sounds a bit more comfortable in the studio/recording setting on this one than on the others, and a tad less countrified and more urbane. The tone is cheerful and easygoing, like that of a well-loved man entertaining his neighbours. Which is not to say this is a throwaway; the phrasing and rhythms are crisp, and the ragtime-speckled folk blues guitar accomplished. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bce4a5432a775df64ed57c5488198633b5222ce","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Pink+Anderson+-+Medicine+Show+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bce4a5432a775df64ed57c5488198633b5222ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,206,74,84,50,167,117,223,100,237,87,197,72,129,152,99,59,82,34,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
