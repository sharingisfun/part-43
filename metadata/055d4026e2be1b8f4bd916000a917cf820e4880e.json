It has some specially-selected optimizations to make it perform faster and extend the life of your USB key as well as a specialized launcher that will allow most of your favorite extensions to work as you switch computers.\nIt will also work from a CDRW drive (in packet mode), ZIP drives, external hard drives, some MP3 players, flash RAM cards and more.\n\nThis is an unofficial package. It is an official build, but has been modified and a specialized launcher added to make extensions portable.\nNo warranty is expressed or implied.\n\nTo use Firefox on your drive, launch it with the PortableFirefox.exe file in the firefox directory. DO NOT launch the firefox.exe file directly, as this will create a profile on your hard drive or use an existing one.\nAdditionally, be sure you've closed any local copies of Firefox and that they've finished shutting down. Otherwise, a new window of your local install will be launched. This is a feature of Firefox itself to prevent multiple copies running at the same time.\n\n\n\nCopied from Mozilla Firefox Homepage:\n\n\nPersonal\n\n\nLibrary\n\nMake your browser as efficient as you can imagine.\nYour browsing history (all the websites youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen) and your bookmarks (all the websites youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve saved) are archived in the Library, where they can be easily searched and organized. You can also save your frequent searches in dynamic smart folders that automatically update as your bookmark list and history grow.\n\n\nTags\n\nLabel a site with names or categories that are meaningful to you.\nFor example, you can label the site www.bbc.co.uk with the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tag as well as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œforeign investmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tag, plus give www.nytimes.com the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tag, too.\nWhen you enter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into the location bar, both sites will be shown as results.\nA single site can have multiple tags, and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no limit to the number of tags you can create. You may not remember the exact name of a site, but with a tag, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be able to find it in a way that makes sense to you.\n\n\nSmart Location Bar\n\nA quick way to get to the sites you loveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even the ones with addresses you only vaguely remember. The new Firefox 3 location bar learns as you use itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so highly evolved that we like to call it the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAwesome BarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nOver time, it adapts to your preferences and offers better fitting matches.\nType in a term and the autocomplete function includes possible matching sites from your browsing history, as well as sites youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve bookmarked and tagged in a drop down. For example, you could enter the tag: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinvestmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to find ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwww.fool.comÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Matched terms are highlighted, making the list of results easy to scan.\n\n\nOne-Click Bookmarking\n\nManage your bookmarks a lot or a little.\nOne click on the star icon at the end of the location bar bookmarks a site.\nTwo clicks and you can choose where to save it and whether to tag it.\nFile bookmarked sites in easy-to-access folders and organize according to theme (like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œjob searchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfavorite shoppingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).\nFind your bookmarked sites in a flash by entering the tag, page or bookmark name into the location bar. The more you use your tags and bookmark names in the location bar, the more the system will adapt to your preferences.\n\n\nSmart Bookmark Folders\n\nThese dynamic folders give you easy access to your favorite sites and can be placed in your Bookmarks menu or Bookmarks toolbar.\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve included some for you as defaults, including one that shows you the sites you visit most frequently (create your own by saving your searches in the Library).\n\n\n\nSecurity &amp; Privacy\n\n\nInstant Web Site ID\n\nWant to be extra sure about a siteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s legitimacy before you make a purchase?\nClick on a site favicon for an instant identity overview.\nAnother click digs deeper: how many times have you visited?\nAre your passwords saved? Check up on suspicious sites, avoid Web forgeries and make sure a site is what it claims to be.\n\n\nAnti-Malware\n\nFirefox 3 protects you from viruses, worms, trojan horses and spyware.\nIf you accidentally access an attack site, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll receive a full-sized browser message as a warning. A continuously updated list of attack-sites tells us when to stop you from browsing, so thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing for you to update or maintain.\n\n\nAnti-Phishing\n\nShop and do business safely on the Internet. Firefox gets a fresh update of web forgery sites 48 times in a day, so if you try to visit a fraudulent site thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pretending to be a site you trust (like your bank), a browser messageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½big as lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½will stop you.\n\n\nParental Controls\n\nEnforce parental control settings youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve entered on Windows Vista with Firefox 3ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½stop unwanted downloads and more. FirefoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intuitive design keeps you from second-guessing your setup.\n\n\nAnti-Virus Software\n\nFirefox 3 integrates elegantly with your antivirus software.\nWhen you download a file, your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s antivirus program automatically checks it to protect you against viruses and other malware, which could otherwise attack your computer. [available in Windows only]\n\n\nAdd-ons\n\nFirefox looks for a secure connection before installing or updating add-ons, 3rd party software, and Personas.\n\n\nPassword Manager\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seamlessly integrated this feature into your surfing experience.\nChoose to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrememberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ site passwords without intrusive pop-ups.\nNow youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œremember passwordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ notification integrated into your view at the top of the site page.\n\n \nClear Private Data\n\nClear your private data automaticallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with just one click or a keyboard shortcut. Your info is gone for goodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½on your own computer or the one at your local library. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that easy.\n\n\nCustomized Security Settings\n\nControl the level of scrutiny youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like Firefox to give a site and enter exceptionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½sites that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need the third degree.\nCustomize settings for passwords, cookies, loading images and installing add-ons for a fully empowered Web experience.\n\n\nAutomated Update\n\nOur open-source security strategy lets us findÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and fixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½security issues in record time, making Firefox the safest way to surf.\nInstall upgrades when you receive automatic notification or wait until youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re ready.\n\n\nPop-Up Blocker\n\nBanish pop-ups (and pop-under windows) from your surfing experience once and for all. Or, find a happy mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½choose to view blocked pop-ups or create an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œallowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ list of sites whose pop-ups youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re okay with seeing.\n\n\n\nCustomization\n\n\nAdd-ons Manager\n\nYou can now find and install add-ons directly in your browser.\nYou no longer need to visit the add-ons Web site, simply fire up the new Add-ons Manager. Not sure which add-on is right for you?\nRatings, recommendations, descriptions and pictures of the add-ons in action help you make your selection. The fully integrated Add-ons Manager even lets you view, manage and disable third-party add-ons in a few easy clicks.\n\n\nOver 5,000 ways to customize\n\nThe skyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the limit with a growing library of over 5,000 Firefox Add-ons, little extras you choose to download and install for a browser that works your way.\nManage online auctions, upload digital photos, see the weather forecast in a glance and listen to music all from the convenience of your browser.\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no need to open a new window or tab for each task.\nDiscover add-ons that help you streamline coding and Web development, like Firebug, which lets you look deep into the structure of a web page.\n\n\nBrowser Look &amp; Feel\n\nDress up your browser as you like it. With themes, choose a darkened control panel reminiscent of a space ship, faux wood paneling, or hundreds of other unique looks to surround your surfing. With Personas, add a simple, lightweight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œskinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to your browser in an instant. (Personas is a Mozilla Labs project.)\n\n\nBeyond Add-ons\n\nAdd-ons are the cornerstone of customization, but adapting Firefox to suit your style doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop there. You can add new search engines, change toolbar preferences, display different sizes, shapes and styles for your browserÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s navigation buttons and more. With additional preferences, you can specify a Web mail client, such as Gmail, to open up when you click on an address from a Web page or set up a news reader application for the blogs you encounter.\n\n\n\nProductivity\n\n\nPlatform-Native Look &amp; Feel\n\nThe new Firefox looks and feels like home.\nThink of it as a Firefox whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really good at making friends.\nWhether you use Windows Vista, Windows XP, Mac or Linux, the browser seamlessly integrates into your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s environment.\nA native look makes for a flawless interface that never gives you pause.\n\n\nFeed Reader\n\nYou can read feeds using an online Web service, a client-side feed reader or by creating a Firefox Live Bookmark. So thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no need to comb the Web for the latest news and updates. See the latest headlines in the toolbar or menu and go directly to the articles that catch your eye.\n\n\nDownload Manager\n\nAn all new manager lets you download seamlessly, with even greater security.\nA pause and resume feature means thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no need to wait for a download to finish before you disconnect. So, if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re halfway through the latest White Stripes album and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to catch the bus, just pause and pick up downloading when you get home. The resume function also works if your system crashes or is forced to restart. The manager shows your download progress and lets you search your files by name or the Web address where the download came from.\n\n\nSpell Checking\n\nA built-in spell checker lets you enter text directly into Web pagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ like blog posts and Web-based emailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½without worrying about typos and misspellings.\nWork directly with the Web and save yourself a step.\n\n\nSession Restore\n\nIf Firefox unexpectedly closes, you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to spend time recovering data or retracing your steps through the Web. If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in the middle of typing an email, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll pick up where you left off, even down to the last word you typed.\nSession Restore instantly brings back your windows and tabs, restoring text you entered and any in-progress downloads. Restart the browser without losing your place after you install an add-on or software update.\n\n\nFull Zoom\n\nVisit your favorite news page and read the caption under the pictureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or view the picture itself in a size you can see. An elegant new zoom feature lets you swoop in and see entire web pages. They scale in the way youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d expect them to, with all the elements of a pageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s layout expanding equally, so you can zero in on what matters.\n\n\nImage Loading\n\nIf you want to save time and bandwidth, view a site without images.\nFirefox will remember your setting the next time you view the page.\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nSmart Keywords\n\nSearch the Web in record time with smart keywords.\nWith a few clicks you can assign keywords to search engines, and then simply enter your key and search words in the location bar.\nWith this feature, typing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbook home buildingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ can search Amazon.com, and take you right to books about home building without ever pausing at the homepage.\n\n\nSearch Suggestions\n\nStart typing in the search bar and it will prompt you with a drop down of filled-in suggestions, plus you can use the search bar as a calculator, converter and more.\n\n\nIntegrated Web Search\n\nSearching the Web is a breeze with the search box inline, just to the right of your location bar. Use the web engine of your choice to search by typing directly into the box. The width is adjustable so you can make it bigger if you need more space.\n\n\nHundreds of Search Engines\n\nAccess your favorite search engines quickly from the integrated search bar.\nYou can use a new engine for each search, or stick to your favorite.\nChoose from a preset dropdown list of engines or select ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmanage search enginesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the same list to browse search engine options offered as add-ons.\n\n\nFind\n\nThe find feature appears in a keystroke. Search for a word or phrase on an open Web page. Highlight text before using the feature and finder opens pre-filled with your selection. See all instances of your search at once, or scroll backwards and forwards through the appearances of the word on the page.\n\n\n\nTabs\n\n\nSave on Exit\n\nNow when you open Firefox, your tabs and windows look just like they did when you closed it down. No need to reopen all your windows each time you start a session.\n\n\nTabs\n\nAt first glance, they look like little labels living above the site youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re currently visiting. But they are a brilliant way to browse multiple sites at once. Simple and easy, you can think of them as the electronic version of a well kept filing cabinet, with the tabs as the dividers and the sites as the content kept in folders. Each new site appears as a new tab (not a new window) and can be accessed in one click.\n\n\nReopen Closed Tabs\n\nIf you accidentally close a tab, you can reopen it in one click.\nJust view Recently Closed Tabs in the History menu and select the tab youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to reopen.\n\n\nDrag &amp; Reorder Tabs\n\nGet your sites in order. Simply arrange the order of your tabs by dragging them in one swift move of your mouse.\n\n\nSmooth Scrolling\n\nLike to have all 20 of your favorite pages open at once?\nAn elegant new feature lets you scroll through tabs easily to see them all and access the one you want quickly.\n\n\n\nUniversal Access\n\n\nUniversal Customization\n\nGo beyond translation and experience the web in a way that makes sense to you. Local developers who know whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best for their community have customized your Firefox browsing experience with local dictionaries, search providers, live bookmarks and Web feeds. Depending on where you live, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see things like BBC headlines tailored to your region or experience features that work with Baidu, the Chinese search engine.\n\n\nThe Language of Firefox\n\nFirefox speaks your language like no other browser on earth.\nBecause the Web is a worldwide resource and we believe that resource belongs to the people, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made our browser available in as many local languages as possible.\nWe have over 40 different translations, from French and Chinese to Finnish and Czech.\n\n\nEmphasis on Accessibility\n\nBy minimizing keystrokes, allowing users to zoom in on Web pages and supporting screen readers, Firefox is that much easier to use for those with mobility disabilities and visual impairments.\n\n\nImproved Text Rendering\n\nRead your language as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writtenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½more like real life.\nWith a new graphics engine, Arabic, Persian, Punjabi and other script languages now render in a remarkably seamless way.\n\n\n\nPerformance\n\n\nImproved Memory Management\n\nWith all new management functions in place, Firefox 3 keeps memory usage under control. The XPCOM cycle collector continuously cleans up unused memory.\nPlus, hundreds of memory leaks are now remedied.\n\n\nFaster JavaScript\n\nFirefox now empowers even greater Web development, with JavaScript 1.8ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½including expression closures, generator expression and array reduce.\n\n\nSmaller Memory Footprint\n\nShort and sweet, Firefox now uses less of your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s memory while itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s running.\n\n\nFaster Page Load\n\nA redesigned page rendering and layout engine means you see Web pages fasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and in the way they were meant to be seen.\n\n\nGraphics Engine Improvements\n\nImproved text rendering is just the beginning of the benefits of an all new graphic engine for Firefox 3.\n\n\n\nStandards\n\n\nAdvanced Graphics\n\nYou have to see it to believe it. The rendering of text and graphics, including SVG and Canvas, is faster, sharper and more true-to-life than ever before, thanks to our new graphics engine.\n\n\nOnline Application Support\n\nExpand the power of Web-based applications.\nIn the past youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d click on an email address in a Web site and your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s default email application would open up to send a message to the linked addressÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even if you never email through the program.\nNow you can choose a Web mail clients (like Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo! Mail) to launch when you click on that email address.\n\n\nSupport for Advanced Web Technologies\n\nBrand new and enhanced functionalities enable Web site authors and developers to create advanced content and applications.\nSupport is now available for CSS, ACID2, MathML, ECMAScript 4, Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG) and Microformats, to name a few.\n\n\nColor Profile Support\n\nPhotographers and photo fans, your view of the Web from Firefox just gets better. You can choose to enable top-of-the-line image display which uses technical data, like the amount of light available and relevant distance information, to render images in an amazing new way.\n\n\nOffline Browsing\n\nTake your computer offline and still have information at your fingertips.\nCertain enabled sites may allow applicationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½like your Web-based emailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to stay with you at all times. Many sites are not yet configured to work with this feature.\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\nLive Support\n\nWe have Firefox experts waiting on stand-by to help you with questions that simply demand a live person and a real conversation.\nNow you can chat with knowledgeable Firefox community members who troubleshoot via our live chat site.

Thank you for helping us test this preview of the latest and greatest version of Firefox before it is officially released to the public.\n\nFirefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) is the latest development milestone of Firefox 3.5, the next version of the Firefox web browser.\nWhile this release is considered to be stable, it is intended for developers and members of our testing community to use for early evaluation and feedback.\nUsers of the latest released version of Firefox should not expect all of their add-ons to work properly with this milestone.\n\nCheck out whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new, the known issues and frequently asked questions about the latest version of Firefox.\n\n\nInstalling\n\nPlease note that installing Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) will overwrite your existing installation of Firefox. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t lose any of your bookmarks or browsing history, but some of your extensions and other add-ons might not work until updates for them are made available.\n\n\nExtensions and Themes\n\nExtensions installed under Firefox 3 may be incompatible and/or require updates to work with Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate).\nPlease report any issues to the maintainer of the extension.\nWhen you install Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) all of your Extensions and Themes will be disabled until Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) determines that either a) they are compatible with the Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) release or b) there are newer versions available that are compatible.\n\n\nKnown Issues\n\nThis list covers some of the known problems with Firefox 3.5 (Release Candidate) which will be fixed in future versions:\n\nAll Systems\n\n* After installing this version, users will not be able to return to a previous beta version of Firefox 3.5 without creating a new profile (see bug 488966)\n\n* Restoring your bookmarks from a backup can take some time, during which the browser may seem unresponsive (see bug 493731)\n\n* After using Clear Recent History some SSL sites will not load all images and styles without pressing reload (see bug 480619)\n\n* Firefox 3.5 will only support color profiles as specified by ICC v2, later versions will add support for ICC v4 (see bug 463221)\n\n* Websites using the new downloadable font support that wish to change the color using :hover will also need to add text-rendering : optimizeLegibility for font sizes less than 20 pixels (see bug 495455)\n\n* Some sites with Flash can cause problems with the Cookies dialog (see bug 495035)\n\n* Web pages can no longer automatically install PKCS11 cryptographic tokens.\nUsers are now required to do this manually or install an Add-on that installs them\n\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\n* Pressing enter in the Location Bar will not do anything if you are running AVG SafeSearch v8.0 or lower. Upgrading AVG SafeSearch fixes the problem (see bug 479095)\n\n* If you select Fax from the Print Dialog, the Windows Fax dialog will appear and then disappear. Faxing still works from other applications (see bug 440486)\n\n\nED2K Link:\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nSeveral security issues:\n\nMFSA 2009-46  Chrome privilege escalation due to incorrectly cached wrapper\n\nMFSA 2009-45 Crashes with evidence of memory corruption (rv:1.9.1.2/1.9.0.13)\n\nMFSA 2009-44 Location bar and SSL indicator spoofing via window.open() on invalid URL\n\nMFSA 2009-38 Data corruption with SOCKS5 reply containing DNS name longer than 15 characters\n\n\nImages with ICC profiles now render properly on all monitors.\n\n\n\nComments from the uploader (olofolleola4):\nYou can read more about Private Browsing here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Private+Browsing&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can read more about TraceMonkey here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can read more about Location Aware Browsing here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can read more about JSON here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSON&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSON&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055d4026e2be1b8f4bd916000a917cf820e4880e","amp;dn":"Mozilla+Firefox+3.5.2+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055d4026e2be1b8f4bd916000a917cf820e4880e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,93,64,38,226,190,27,143,75,217,22,0,10,145,124,248,32,228,136,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
