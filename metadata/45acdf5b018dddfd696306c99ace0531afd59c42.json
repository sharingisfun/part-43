The film highlights that the number of dolphins killed in the Taiji dolphin hunting drive is several times greater than the number of whales killed in the Antarctic, and claims that 23,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed in Japan every year in the country's whaling industry. The migrating dolphins are herded into a hidden cove where they are netted and killed by means of spears and knives over the side of small fishing boats.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan's most recent progress report 1,569 cetaceans in Taiji were killed during the 2007 season, including methods other than drive hunting. The Ministry claims that only 1,239 cetaceans were killed by drive hunting, and that a total of 13,080 cetaceans were killed throughout Japan in 2007.\n\nThe film was directed by former National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos,and portions were filmed secretly during 2007 using underwater microphones and high-definition cameras disguised as rocks.\n\n\n\n\nThe documentary won the U.S. Audience Award at the 25th annual Sundance Film Festival in January 2009. It was selected out of the 879 submissions in the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by: Louie Psihoyos\n---------------------------\n\nWritten by: Mark Monroe\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nTitle: The Cove\nYear: 2009\nFile Size: 700 MB\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:31:22\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 576x320\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1071 kbit/s\nDisplay Aspect ratio: 16/9\nFPS: 23.976023\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels: 2\nSubtitles: (External English + Swedish)       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;---- ( NOTE )\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1313104/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1313104/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\t\t\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45acdf5b018dddfd696306c99ace0531afd59c42","amp;dn":"The+Cove-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45acdf5b018dddfd696306c99ace0531afd59c42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,172,223,91,1,141,221,253,105,99,6,201,154,206,5,49,175,213,156,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
