They are still making live appearances and recordings as of 2009\n\n\nAn official commentary included in the CD set Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965-1975 states that vocalist Danny HuttonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s then-girlfriend June Fairchild thought of the name when she read a magazine article about indigenous Australians, in which it was explained that on cold nights they would customarily sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a dingo, a native species of wild dog. On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs, and if a night was especially cold, it was a &quot;Three Dog Night&quot;.\n\n\nThe band started in 1968 with three lead vocalists, Danny Hutton (who got his start with Hanna-Barbera Records in 1965), Chuck Negron, and Cory Wells who landed a recording contract with Dunhill Records in Los Angeles. They had made some early recordings in 1967 with Brian Wilson, and initially went by the name Redwood. Shortly after abandoning the Redwood moniker, the vocalists hired a group of backing musicians: Michael Allsup on guitar, Floyd Sneed on drums, Joe Schermie from the Cory Wells Blues Band on bass, and Jimmy Greenspoon on keyboards and soon became one of the most successful bands in the US during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThree Dog Night earned 13 gold albums and recorded 21 Billboard Top 40 hits, seven of which went gold. Their first gold record was &quot;One&quot; (US #5), which had been written and recorded by Harry Nilsson. They had three U.S. number one songs: &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot;, which was also their only Top 10 hit in the UK, &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and &quot;Black and White&quot;. Dunhill Records claimed 40 million LP units were sold by them during that time period.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy to the World ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Their Greatest Hits 1974\n\n\nJoy to the World: Their Greatest Hits is the twelfth album by American rock band Three Dog Night, released in 1974 (see 1974 in music). It is the follow-up compilation to Golden Bisquits, consisting of 11 (out of 12) charted hits from the group's previous four studio albums (The Top 20 hit &quot;Pieces Of April&quot; was left off for reasons unknown), 2 charted hits that already appeared on their first greatest hits compilation (&quot;One&quot; and &quot;One Man Band&quot;), and non-charting B-side &quot;I'd Be So Happy&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Joy to the World&quot; (Hoyt Axton) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n2.\t&quot;One&quot; (Harry Nilsson) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n3.\t&quot;Sure as I'm Sittin' Here&quot; (John Hiatt) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n4.\t&quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song&quot; (Paul Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n5.\t&quot;Let Me Serenade You&quot; (John Finley) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n6.\t&quot;Shambala&quot; (Daniel Moore) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n7.\t&quot;Black and White&quot; (David I.
