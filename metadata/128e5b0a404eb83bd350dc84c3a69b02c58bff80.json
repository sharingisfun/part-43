It is an anthology series: each episode has a self-contained story and its own cast. As the title suggests, each story is a thriller of some variety, from tales of the supernatural to down-to-earth whodunits.\nContents\n[hide]\n\n* 1 Background\n* 2 Episodes\no 2.1 Season 1 (1973)\no 2.2 Season 2 (1974)\no 2.3 Season 3 (1974)\no 2.4 Season 4 (1975)\no 2.5 Season 5 (1975)\no 2.6 Season 6 (1976)\n* 3 DVD and Video release\n* 4 External links\n\n[edit] Background\n\nThe series was created by Brian Clemens, who also scripted the majority of the episodes and storylined every installment, and produced by John Sichel (the first 3 series), John Cooper (series 4) and Ian Fordyce (the final two series) for Associated TeleVision (ATV) at their Elstree studios north of London. It evolved from Clemens' previous work, in particular two films of a similar style, And Soon the Darkness (EMI-ABP 1970) and Blind Terror (aka See No Evil (Columbia 1971). The latter shared plot similarities with the Thriller episodes &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot; and &quot;The Next Voice Your See&quot;. Original music, including the theme tune, was by Clemens' regular collaborator Laurie Johnson.\n\nThe stories are often set in the English home counties &quot;stockbroker belt&quot;, but most episodes, especially from the second season onwards, feature at least one American character, mostly portrayed by an imported US guest star, to appeal to the American market. After originally being screened late night in the US under the ABC Mystery Movie billing from 1973, in 1978 some episodes were retitled for US syndication and all had additional opening sequences shot, with new titles and credits. Since these were made without the original cast they often feature menacing figures seen only from the neck down. These replaced original UK and US title sequence that featured a sequence of shots through a fisheye lens, bordered in bright red.\n\nFollowing a worldwide audit in 2003/4, by the then licence holders Carlton, all the original UK PAL fisheye titled original 2&quot; videotapes of &quot;Thriller&quot; were located and remastered onto modern digital tape by the British Film Institute. (One exception was the story &quot;Nurse Will Make It Better&quot; .. however this too exists in PAL/original format as a 1&quot; dub from the original master tape. This version was repeat broadcast on the satellite channel Bravo in 1996).\n\n[edit] Episodes\n\n[edit] Season 1 (1973)\nEpisode title Original transmission Notable cast\nLady Killer\n(US title: The Death Policy) 14 April 1973 Barbara Feldon, T.
