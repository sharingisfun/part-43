After being signed to and quickly dropped from Def Jam Records at age 19, she began performing in the rock music scene of New York City's Lower East Side. During this time, she was also working at Interscope Records as a songwriter for several established acts, including Akon, who, after hearing Gaga sing, convinced Interscope chairman Jimmy Iovine to sign her to a joint deal with the label and Akon's Kon Live Distribution label.\n\nHer debut album The Fame was released in August 2008 to critical and commercial success. In addition to receiving generally positive reviews, it has gone to number one in four countries, also topping the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart in the United States. The album's first two singles, &quot;Just Dance&quot; and &quot;Poker Face,&quot; have become international number one hits, and the former was nominated for Best Dance Recording at the 51st Grammy Awards. In 2009, after having opened for New Kids on the Block and the Pussycat Dolls, Gaga embarked on her first headlining tour, The Fame Ball Tour. To date she has sold over 20 million digital singles and 3 million albums worldwide, which makes her one of the biggest-selling artists of 2009.\n\nMusically, Gaga is inspired by glam rockers such as David Bowie and Queen, as well as pop singers such as Michael Jackson, Kylie Minogue and Madonna. She is also inspired by fashion, which she claims is an essential component to her songwriting and performances. She is supportive of the gay community, crediting them for her early mainstream success.\n\nTracks:\n\n01  Fashion\n02  Starstruck [Ft.
