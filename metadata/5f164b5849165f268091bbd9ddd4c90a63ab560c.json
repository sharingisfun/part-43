Like their freshman release, new album,  \nTri-Polar will feature producer credits in Rock Mafia's      \nAntonina Armato and Tim James. Together they've created a    \nsound that reflects the past four whirlwind years spent in   \nthe rock and roll fast lane, on the grueling tour grind,     \nhoning their chops until they were a finely tuned            \npowerhouse ready to let loose with the anger, frustration    \nand triumphs built up from all that road work.               \n                                                             \nSongs like the storming first single, &quot;You're Going Down,&quot;   \nwhich is being used as the theme song for the WWE's Extreme  \nRules pay-per-view broadcast, and &quot;Street Fighter War,&quot;      \nwhich was used as part of the national marketing campaign    \nfor the popular video game Street Fighter IV, distill all    \nthat energy into high-powered festival anthems. &quot;There was   \nplenty of fuel, a lot of hard times, strain, personal        \nproblems and all that jazz,&quot; says Moore of the creative      \nprocess, &quot;and we just put it all into the record. There's    \nno way you can prevent it from flooding into the music.&quot;     \nSick Puppies' Tri-Polar hits stores on July 14th.&quot;-          \npuregrainaudio.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f164b5849165f268091bbd9ddd4c90a63ab560c","amp;dn":"Sick+Puppies+-Tri-Polar-2009-ApoLLo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f164b5849165f268091bbd9ddd4c90a63ab560c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,22,75,88,73,22,95,38,128,145,187,217,221,212,201,10,99,171,86,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
