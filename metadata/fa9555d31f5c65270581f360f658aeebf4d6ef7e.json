The band rose to prominence with the release of their album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin. The album was originally self-released by the band in September 2008, and was later re-released by Nonesuch Records in America and British label Bella Union in Europe.\n\nSmart Flesh:\n\nFrom December 2009 until February 2010, the band recorded their third album, Smart Flesh, in the abandoned PorinoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pasta sauce factory in Central Falls, RI. The album was engineered by Jesse Lauter and mixed by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes). The album was released February 22, 2011. The band released &quot;Ghost Woman Blues&quot;, the first song on the record as a free download in December on their website. The band appeared again on The Late Show with David Letterman on January 12, 2011, performing &quot;Ghost Woman Blues&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Low_Anthem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Low_Anthem&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nListening to The Low AnthemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s breakthrough album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Oh My God, Charlie Darwin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was a jarring experience. It was a clashing of two genres: profoundly moving acoustic folk and raucous blues-rock. The clash was so marked, it sounded like two separate bands. But the album was roundly praised by critics, who claimed that the two tones combined to capture a vision of America that was grounded in tradition but evolving and fragmented.\n\nWhether you agree or not, it was a tough listen. Smart Flesh plays no such games. Its tone is more unified, dominated by the sensitive end of The Low AnthemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spectrum: while its predecessor is difficult to define, Smart Flesh is unquestionably a folk album, a record of acoustic guitars, banjos, vocal harmonies and timeless tales. The rock is still there on Hey, All You Hippies! and Boeing 737, but now it pours out in a more controlled fashion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ so as not to stamp all over the delicacy of the other songs, but to complement them. Indeed, Boeing 737 is a huge, stomping anthem that sounds like Bob Dylan fronting Arcade Fire. If The Low Anthem donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t release it as a single, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re mad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest of the album is easy-going and mellifluous, songs built on the simplest of patterns. Each songwriter takes their turn, but the voices donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t compete with each other. So Ben Knox MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Love and Altar, which shares a similar angelic tone to Bon Iver, blends seamlessly into Jeff PrystowskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Matter of Time, even though the latterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal is gravellier. And then we get Jocie AdamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clarinet solo on Wire, which is stunning.\n\nFans of Oh My God, Charlie Darwin may be disappointed by just how well Smart Flesh hangs together, and there is certainly an argument to be had here about whether this more unified sound is a little too predictable, a little too easy, to keep you gripped. There are lulls amongst these 11 tracks when your mind starts to wander ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Burn doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t deserve its slot after Wire, and should have been dropped altogether, while some of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s later tracks seem to mimic what has gone before. An injection of passion towards the end would have helped: without it, Smart Flesh comes across as a little too atonal to be described as a classic.\n\nLink to this BBC Review:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/698r&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/698r&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
