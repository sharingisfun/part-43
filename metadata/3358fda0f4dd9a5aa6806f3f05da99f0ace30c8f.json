While the thoughts that make us feel as though we know ourselves are easy to experience, they are notoriously difficult to explain. So, in order to find out where they come from, Marcus subjects himself to a series of probing experiments.\n\nHe learns at what age our self-awareness emerges and whether other species share this trait. Next, he has his mind scrambled by a cutting-edge experiment in anaesthesia. Having survived that ordeal, Marcus is given an out-of-body experience in a bid to locate his true self. And in Hollywood, he learns how celebrities are helping scientists understand the microscopic activities of our brain. Finally, he takes part in a mind-reading experiment that both helps explain and radically alters his understanding of who he is.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3358fda0f4dd9a5aa6806f3f05da99f0ace30c8f","amp;dn":"The+Secret+You++%28BBC+Horizon+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3358fda0f4dd9a5aa6806f3f05da99f0ace30c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,88,253,160,244,221,154,90,166,128,111,63,5,218,153,240,172,227,12,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
