He communicates such an open, wide-eyed innocence through his work that it's difficult at first to believe he can be for real. But McNabb's willingness to express, from a male perspective, emotions uncommon for conventional rock's posturing swagger soon makes you a convert. When, for instance, was the last time a guy convincingly sang about &quot;Camaraderie&quot; in a way that could (at least, until the very end) apply in an equally touching way to a male or female respondent? The tone of McNabb's cosy-fireplace vocals -- especially on ballads like &quot;Too Close to the Sun&quot; -- sometimes evoke legendary crooner Scott Walker, likely through such second-hand bridges as David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, or perhaps fellow-Liverpudlian Julian Cope's (the Teardrop Explodes) influential 1981 Walker compilation The Godlike Genius Of....\n\n\nAt the same time, parts of Merseybeast (notably &quot;Heydays&quot; and &quot;They Settled for Less than They Wanted&quot;) make me think of some lost Mick Ronson album. On his own sporadic solo releases, the late Spiders from Mars guitarist shared McNabb's talent for making an ingratiating, &quot;golly-gee&quot; naivete work to his advantage. (Speaking of &quot;They Settled,&quot; I can also hear former Call vocalist Michael Been tackling this dense, lugubrious anthem of disappointment and missed opportunity, one of the rare downers on the disc.) &quot;Don't Put Your Spell on Me&quot; harkens back to Liverpool's postpunk salad days, a track that would have been envied in the early '80s by both Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes.\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus CD, &quot;North West Coast&quot; was printed in limited quantities.\nIt was recorded live at King's College, London, June 1994. Engineered by Dave Porter and mixed by Bruce Lampcov. Mixing engineer is Lloyd Gardiner. Tracks 4 &amp; 5 mixed by Ian McNabb and Lloyd Gardiner. According to an interview with Ian in McNabb Rag issue #8, Noel Gallagher of Oasis appears on the disk, although he is not credited. Credited musicians include Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot of Crazy Horse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD 1: Merseybeast\n\n1. Merseybeast ( 6:44 )\n2. Affirmations ( 3:33 )\n3. Beautiful Old Mystery ( 4:10 )\n4.
