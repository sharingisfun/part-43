When a teething Alicia keeps her father up at nights, an exhausted Alan is thrilled when Diane offers to help out. Alan decides to get back into the social swing by asking Diane out on a date. Kate's inattention to pre-op labs results in the post-op death of the transplant patient. Billy arrives home just in time to save his dog Gordie from the fire that's engulfed his apartment, and ends up rooming with a reluctant Danny until he can find a new place to live. Danny overcomes his dislike of Gordie long enough to notice that he's critically ill, and by acting quickly, saves the dog's life. \n\n\n\nMore to follow, please give back as much as you take.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0b868cc38307e87165da3a71d0f7a8539713f9","amp;dn":"Chicago+Hope+S02E04+-+Every+Day+a+Little+Death.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d0b868cc38307e87165da3a71d0f7a8539713f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,11,134,140,195,131,7,232,113,101,218,58,113,208,247,168,83,151,19,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
