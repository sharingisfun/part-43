It both promotes Sartrean views and adopts a consistently analytical approach to him. Concentrating on the early philosophy, up to and including Sartre's masterwork Being and Nothingness, Gregory McCulloch clearly shows how much analytic philosophy misses when it neglects Sartre and the continental tradition in philosophy.\nIn the classic spirit of analytic philosophy, this is a clear, simple and appealingly short exposition of the early work of Sartre. Written specifically for beginners and non-specialists, this book is sure to spark new interest in Sartre and the existentialists, while making a significant contribution to the development of analytical philosophy of mind as well.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.routledge.com/books/Using-Sartre-isbn9780415109543&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.routledge.com/books/Using-Sartre-isbn9780415109543&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nContent:\n\n\n1 Overview 1\n\n    Methodology 2\n    A great metaphysical division 3\n    Aims 4\n    SartreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s five theses 5\n    Notes and further reading 11\n\n2 Emotions 13\n\n    Experience 13\n    Emotions and intentionality 15\n    A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“specific manner of apprehending the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 17\n    The background: Phenomenology and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“anthropologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 20\n    Appendix: intentional objects 25\n    Notes and further reading 31\n\n3 Nothingness, freedom, anguish 33\n    \n    Nothingness and possibilities 34\n    Freedom 38\n    Aims and values 44\n    Anguish and the flight from anguish 45\n    Notes and further reading 50\n\n4 Bad faith and self-deception 52\n\n    Self-deception 54\n    The unconscious 55\n    Transcendence and facticity: BeingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two faces 56\n    So what is the solution? 62\n    What to do? 64\n    Notes and further reading 70\n\n\n5 Imaging 71\n\n    Imaging and intentionality 71\n    The Picture Gallery Model of Imaging 72\n    Crypto-objects 76\n    The Problem of Phenomenological Presence 78\n    The Argument from Illusion 81\n    Notes and further reading 82\n\n6 Realism and idealism 83\n\n    Descartes and Berkeley 84\n    Theories of perception 87\n    What experience is like 88\n    Notes and further reading 94\n\n7 Sartrean realism 97\n\n    The being of consciousness 98\n    The being of appearance 102\n    Externalism: the mind ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t in the head 106\n    Externalist phenomenology 107\n    Elements of idealism? 111\n    Notes and further reading 117\n\n8 Shame 121\n\n    The problems of the Other 121\n    The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“reef of solipsismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 124\n    Approaching the scepticism 125\n    Against solipsism: the look 131\n    Sorcerers 135\n    The whole useless passion 137\n    Notes and further reading 140\n\n\n\nYou can buy this book as paperback.
