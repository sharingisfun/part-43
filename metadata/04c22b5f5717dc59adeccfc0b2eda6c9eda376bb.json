It inherits many of the best features of\nC++ and Microsoft Visual Basic but few of the inconsistencies and anachronisms, resulting in\na cleaner and more logical language. With the advent of C# 2.0 in 2005, several important\nnew features were added to the language, including generics, iterators, and anonymous\nmethods. C# 3.0, available as part of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, adds further features,\nsuch as extension methods, lambda expressions, and, most famously of all, the Language\nIntegrated Query facility, or LINQ. The development environment provided by Visual Studio\n2008 makes these powerful features easy to use, and the many new wizards and enhancements\nincluded in Visual Studio 2008 can greatly improve your productivity as a developer.\n\nInclude all example code for use with the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04c22b5f5717dc59adeccfc0b2eda6c9eda376bb","amp;dn":"Visual+C%23+2008+Step+by+Step+%2B+All+Codes+%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsuperl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04c22b5f5717dc59adeccfc0b2eda6c9eda376bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,194,43,95,87,23,220,89,173,236,207,192,178,237,166,201,237,163,118,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
