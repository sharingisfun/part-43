The same situation in 1972 produced the excellent live album, Rock Of Ages. They would travel a different journey in 1973 and release an album of cover songs.\n\nMoondog Matinee would take its name from an old Alan Freed radio show. The original intent was to return to their early rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ roll days when they were known as Levon and The Hawks. Unfortunately, it did not reach fruition as they were now far from the sound of those days. What did result was an excellent album of unique covers by one of the best rock bands in the world. \n\nThe instrumental expertise of Robbie Robertson and Garth Hudson drive the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music along. Robertson was an under the radar guitarist who was improving with each release. His solos were now confident as well as creative. Garth Hudson was one of the best keyboardists in rock music and his use of an organ sound to enhance, and at times, dominate a rock band was both unique and inspirational. \n\nWhile The Band had four exquisite voices, it was Richard Manuel that came closest to being the lead singer. The Platters classic hit, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Great Pretender,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is given a soulful  vocal by Manuel. He was one of those rare singers who could take a song and make it a personal experience for the listener. The Leiber and Stoller tune, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSaved,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is taken in a gospel like direction by Manuel. He explores the textures of this song with just his vocal instrument. \n\nThe Band pays tribute to former contributor Allen Toussaint by giving his song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoly Cow,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a work-out. Rick DankoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal leads the assault on this track. Danko also shows an ability to translate a straight rhythm &amp; blues song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Change Is Gonna Come,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into a rock setting. \n\nI have always thought the old movie song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Third Man Theme,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was an odd and ultimately brilliant choice for inclusion on the album. The original featured a zither. Here, Garth Hudson, turns his organ loose with interesting results.\n\nOther songs of note include a rocking version of Chuck BerryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Promised Land,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a unique take on the old Elvis song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMystery Train,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which appears with some new lyrics and a funky ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Got No HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Levon Helm as the frog.\n\nMoondog Matinee may have found The Band in a holding pattern in 1973, but the album proved a nice place to visit. It would end up as a unique release in The BandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s catalogue and remains interesting and very listenable today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nRick Danko - bass, rhythm guitar, vocals\nLevon Helm - drums, bass, rhythm guitar, vocals\nGarth Hudson - organ, piano, accordion, synthesizer, clavinet, tenor saxophone\nRichard Manuel - acoustic and electric pianos, drums, vocals\nRobbie Robertson - guitars\nBilly Mundi - drums on &quot;Ain't Got No Home&quot; and &quot;Mystery Train&quot;\nBen Keith - pedal steel on &quot;The Promised Land&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01. &quot;Ain't Got No Home&quot;   3:20 \n    (Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry) \n02. &quot;Holy Cow&quot;    3:15 \n    (Allen Toussaint)\n03. &quot;Share Your Love (With Me)&quot;    2:50 \n    (Deadric Malone, Alfred Braggs)\n04. &quot;Mystery Train&quot;    5:35 \n    (H.
