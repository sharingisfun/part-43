Thankfully, on There Are Rules, the Get Up Kids beat the odds and deliver an album that lives up to their legend -- if they havent come up with another touchstone like Something to Write Home About that recalls the glory days before emo became an insult -- they still sound like a smart, focused, wiry rock band whose attack is noticeably harder and more aggressive than on 2004s Guilt Show. James Dewees keyboards play a bigger role in the arrangements on There Are Rules than they usually did in the past, but his clean, often jagged electronic tones resonate with Matthew Pryor and Jim Suptics guitars, and with the addition of the admirably tight rhythm section of bassist Robert Pope and drummer Ryan Pope, it coheres into music that urges the GUKs sound into a place thats very much their own, and doesnt simply rehash what theyve done in the past. \n\nReleased: 2011\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Alternative\nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: FLAC\n\n  Tracks:\n    \n    1.
