But what a day. A day that shows a lighter side to life in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢hood. That brought Ice Cube (Barbershop) and Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) to a wider audience. And thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now even more uproarious in an Extended DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cut never before available. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Friday, and Craig (Cube) and Smokey (Tucker) must come up with $200 they owe a local bully or there wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be a Saturday. Co-writer Cube, director F. Gary Gray and other innovative movie talents lace the plot with shrewdly hilarious looks at family (including John Witherspoon), a preacher (Bernie Mac), a girl-next-door (Nia Long) and all manner of the good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ bad of life in South Central. This is keepinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢-it-real comedy for every day of the week.\n\nGenres: Comedy / Drama\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease HELP SEED so others can also enjoy the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2654f7cff571ea9d03e3416ed4eab0aaaec3ef","amp;dn":"Friday.1080p.AC3%28DD%29.5.1ch.Blu-ray.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2654f7cff571ea9d03e3416ed4eab0aaaec3ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,38,84,247,207,245,113,234,157,3,227,65,110,212,234,176,170,174,195,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
