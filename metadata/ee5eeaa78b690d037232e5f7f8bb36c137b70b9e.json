ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guaranteed to be one of the greatest electronic albums of 2011, so if you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t discovered The Subs, then now is your chance to make the switch to the right kind of electronica.\n\n\nsee also at my other torrents:      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease help seeding this one for a while!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee5eeaa78b690d037232e5f7f8bb36c137b70b9e","amp;dn":"The+Subs+-+Decontrol+%282011%29-%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee5eeaa78b690d037232e5f7f8bb36c137b70b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,94,234,167,139,105,13,3,114,50,229,247,248,187,54,193,55,183,11,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
