Stephen is the mastermind, for who the intricacy of the story used in the con is as important as the positive \noutcome of the swindle. Bloom is the main character of Stephen's stories, the character he considers the anti-hero. As adults, \nthey travel the world and never enlist the same people twice in their cons, except for their consistent sidekick, the mysterious \nand primarily silent Bang Bang, a Japanese woman who just appeared in their lives one day and who has a penchant for blowing \nthings up. As Bloom hits his mid-thirties, he wants to quit the business as he is losing his own identity to that of the characters \nhe portrays; he doesn't know anymore what is real and what is make-believe. Stephen talks him into one last con, the mark to be \nthe eccentric, lonely but beautiful New Jersey heiress, Penelope Stamp. Penelope's primary past-time in life is to, as she calls \nit, &quot;borrow hobbies&quot;: when she sees something she likes, she learns how to do it solely through reading books. As the brothers go \nthrough their final con on Penelope, three main problems may occur to thwart the plan. First, the brothers' former mentor and now \narch enemy, Diamond Dog, may exact his long awaited revenge on the brothers. Second, Penelope may end up being more unpredictable \nthan all their former marks. And third, Bloom, who has let love slip by in his life, may fall for Penelope. But through the process, \nno one ever really knows who is conning who.\n\n \nRachel Weisz ... Penelope Stamp\nAdrien Brody ... Bloom\nMark Ruffalo ... Stephen\nRinko Kikuchi ...
