The text traces how Guthrie documented the history of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poor and disadvantaged through lyrics about topics as diverse as the Dust Bowl and the poll tax. Divided into chapters covering specific historical topics such as race relations and lynchings, famous outlaws, the Great Depression, unions, the book takes an in-depth look at how Guthrie manipulated his lyrics to explore pressing issues and to bring greater political and economic awareness to the common people. \nIncorporating the best of both historical and literary perspectives, Mark Allan Jackson references primary sources including interviews, records, drawings, and writings. He includes a variety of materials from the Smithsonian Institution, the Library of Congress, and the Woody Guthrie Archives. Many of these have never before been widely available.
