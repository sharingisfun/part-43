According to these sources, they were a learned caste who officiated in religious ceremonies, taught the ancient wisdoms, and were revered as philosophers. But few figures flit so elusively through history, and the Druids remain enigmatic and puzzling to this day. In this Very Short Introduction, one of the leading authorities on British archaeology, Barry Cunliffe, takes the reader on a fast-paced look at the ever-fascinating story of the Druids, as seen in the context of the times and places in which they practiced. Sifting through the evidence, Cunliffe offers an expert's best guess as to what can be said and what can't be said about the Druids, discussing the origins of the Druids and the evidence for their beliefs and practices, why the nature of the druid caste changed quite dramatically over time, and how successive generations have seen them in very different ways. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Examines the origins of the Druids and the evidence for their beliefs and practices, in particular asking what can and can't be known about them\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Explains how the nature of the Druid caste changed quite dramatically over time\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Considers current revivals of Druidism and analyzes different attitudes towards them\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Part of the bestselling Very Short Introductions series - over three million copies sold worldwide\n\n\nThe Author\nBarry Cunliffe is Emeritus Professor of European Archaeology at Oxford University. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b258a21521af6d97d8d62f8ed52072f76ef88043","amp;dn":"The+Druids+A+Very+Short+Introduction+%28pdf%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b258a21521af6d97d8d62f8ed52072f76ef88043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,88,162,21,33,175,109,151,216,214,47,142,213,32,114,247,110,248,128,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
