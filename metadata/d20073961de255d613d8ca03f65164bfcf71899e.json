So something this drastic is to be expected really. And it suits them, 'Papillon' is full of emotion and drama. It's just expressed in a different way. Whether or not this will represent a complete overhaul on the record, remains to be heard. But as for now, Editors are back and are pushing things in the right direction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20073961de255d613d8ca03f65164bfcf71899e","amp;dn":"Editors++Papillon+%2FEP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20073961de255d613d8ca03f65164bfcf71899e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,0,115,150,29,226,85,214,19,216,202,3,246,81,100,191,207,113,137,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
