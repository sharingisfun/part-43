BUT I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT NEWS! I went to my millionth (approx.)\nKidstreet concert last night and it was the easily the best, most energetic\none I've ever attended. Just before I was about to leave, Edna, the lead\nsinger, comes up to me and asks me if I'm the guy who makes Cut The Crap\nPlaylists. Turns out they recognized the design on the shirt I wore to a previous concert as the ex-logo of my website and put two and two together. They also\ngot an interview with a staff member of an Australian magazine who downloads\nCTC Playlists. To that interviewer: THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME SEEM MORE AWESOME\nTHAN I ACTUALLY AM! And thank you to Kidstreet for being really awesome about\nme sharing their music on the internet.\n\nKidstreet's album will drop next spring, with singles released prior to\nthat date. Expect tracks to appear on iTunes and be re-recorded in the\nnear future as well.\n\nCheers, and I hope everyone enjoyed summer as much as I did. Enjoy this\nridiculously huge playlist (by CTC standards, anyway)!\n\n-Josh\n\nPS: This playlist is best listened to in order, but not all at once. Let\nthe songs sink in! You have an entire month until the next one, after all.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\ncut the crap playlists: a fresh batch of genre- and border-crossing\ntracks every month. good music, for free, monthly. it doesn't have to be\nnew... it just has to be good! please support artists you like by\npurchasing music and attending concerts.\n\nfind out about new ctc playlists first at the ONLY official ctc website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n                          Tracklisting:\n                          `````````````\n        * = NEW!
