Vocalist Josh Todd leads this high-energy act into battle with the colossal one-two-three punch of &quot;So Far,&quot; &quot;Next 2 You,&quot; and &quot;Out Of Line,&quot; each anchored by the weighty rhythm section of drummer Xavier Muriel and bassist Jimmy Ashhurst, then elevated by the Olympian guitar attack of Keith Nelson and Stevie D. \n\nBut while an appropriate levity prevails on those tracks and others--such as &quot;Crazy Bitch,&quot; &quot;Broken Glass,&quot; and the good time stomp &quot;Brooklyn&quot;--the band also find time to show a more sensitive and mature side with the hit-worthy and country-inflected &quot;Carousel,&quot; plus the unapologetically melancholy &quot;Sorry.&quot; \n\nIf there's a fault to be found on 15 it doesn't reveal itself easily, and if there's a fault to be found with Buckcherry it is perhaps that they imbue listeners with a zest for living. But that clearly is no crime.\n\nPlease seed to at least 1:1\n\nComments welcome\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78062c0bdc6f44416e3ba50713b745d687c1b123","amp;dn":"Buckcherry+-+15+320CBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78062c0bdc6f44416e3ba50713b745d687c1b123","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,6,44,11,220,111,68,65,110,59,165,7,19,183,69,214,135,193,177,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
