The Hot Topics series\nprovides clear, balanced, and thoughtful examination of the\nhot-button issues of the day. Carefully crafted narrative,\nfully documented primary and secondary source quotations,\ninformative sidebars, and study questions all provide\nexcellent starting points for research and discussion. Full color\nphotographs, maps, and charts enhance all volumes in\nthe series.\n\nThe present book examines the issues surrounding the environment\nand provides an overview of the topic.\nMillions of different things live in our world. From the giant\nblue whale to the tiny ant, from the tallest redwood trees\nto the tiniest blade of grass, every living thing is dependent on\neverything else. Going green is about remembering that the decisions\nwe make have an impact on the earth on which we live\nand the other living things that live here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6add5ca9692a7a2cb861de06b2a1d8b6067d3da4","amp;dn":"Going+Green+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6add5ca9692a7a2cb861de06b2a1d8b6067d3da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,221,92,169,105,42,122,44,184,97,222,6,178,161,216,182,6,125,61,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
