Taking a screen shot \n\nis now fast and simple, even faster than on Maverick (Linux 10.10).\n\nP.s- It takes screen shots in .png format only due to it's wide use.\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PLEASE COMMENT AND MAKE REQUESTS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nTell me what you think! I wan't to here from ScreenCap.exe users!\n\nDid it help you? is it useful? did it not work? Do you like it!?!\n\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\nFeel free to request a simple application! i.e- Do you mail stuff \n\noften? I can make an email client that can send attachments from\n\nyour email! Or do you have really private data that needs to stay\n\nPrivate? I made a script that uses rar.exe to super encrypt any \n\nfile with a 30-70 character password that would take millions of\n\nyears to decrypt w/o a password as stated by the makers of Winrar!\n\nFor any serious request's, leave me a commen't at -\n\n&quot;http://riograndeforums.dyndns.org/1337/comment/&quot; which is my cheesy\n\nlittle web site! Just leave me you'r request and I'll get back at ya!\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||AutoIt||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f19dde5811678203c257100ae9f4c4c920413a1","amp;dn":"Speedy+screen+capture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f19dde5811678203c257100ae9f4c4c920413a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,25,221,229,129,22,120,32,60,37,113,0,174,159,76,76,146,4,19,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
