An exclusive look at the making of the video was presented throughout the evening (8:00- 9:00 p.m., ET/PT) during episodes of Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly Place.\n\nDirected by Philip Andelman (who has directed music videos for John Mayer and Demi Lovato), is a period piece that depicts the love story between a young woman and a sailor as he is preparing to deploy to war. Kevin Jonas said that The Notebook was one of the inspirations for the video.\n\nKevin, Joe and Nick Jonas portray multiple characters, including members of a ballroom band. A sweeping dance number, vintage wardrobe and cars bring the Jonas BrothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ vision to life. Camilla Belle and Josh Boswell also star.\n\nThe music video depicts two children browsing through a photo album that is based in the early 1940s. It zooms into the pictures from the album in which they come to life. On the video is a tale of two lovers with the Brothers acting as their &quot;guardian angels&quot;. Then all the men are called off to war. The video ends in a ballroom with an epic dance extravaganza, where the couple are dancing, and the Jonas Brothers performing as a ballroom band. As the song ends, the photo album closes, ending the video.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b0332dcef0810cee375ceb2d43b8fd2eb19fe1","amp;dn":"Jonas+Brothers+-+Lovebug++%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b0332dcef0810cee375ceb2d43b8fd2eb19fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,176,51,45,206,240,129,12,238,55,92,235,45,67,184,253,46,177,159,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
