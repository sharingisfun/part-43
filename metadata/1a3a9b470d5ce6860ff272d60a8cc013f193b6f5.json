ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s but one of the intriguing notions at the heart of Stan RidgwayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2010 release, Neon Mirage, arguably the most refined, yet musically eclectic collection of the veteran L.A. singer-songwriter/Wall of Voodoo founderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou never really have a choice about the tone and subject matter of the records you make,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Ridgway confides. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAt least I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re obsessions, really. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about the music, and how it heals the mind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When Stan lost a beloved uncle, a colleague (Texas violinist Amy Farris, whose brilliant Neon Mirage work serves as fitting elegy), and the man who inspired so much of the musicianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own worldview, his own father, during the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s writing/recording, Ridgway responded with some of the most reflective ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if no less joyous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ songs heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d ever recorded. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvents like that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but have an impact on the music youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re making at the time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Stan admits. &quot;YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be lying to yourself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and your listeners ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if you thought otherwise. I've probably confused people with my music, my choices, the albums and the changes in direction from year to year. But I canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help it. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a weird old American jukebox in my head and it still plays everything thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever got under my skin.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n&quot;Music is more than just chords and notes to me, it has the ability to make pictures in the mind. My records are designed to be seen as well as heard.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nStan Ridgway ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Electric &amp; acoustic guitars, harmonica, electronics, vocals.\nPietra Wexstun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Keyboards, piano, organ, electronics, melodic, vocals.\nRick King ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Electric &amp; acoustic guitars, electric bass, dobro, slide guitar, pedal steel, vocals.\nRalph Carney ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Saxophone, flute, pipes, horns, woodwinds.\nAmy Farris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Violin, viola, cello, mandolin, vocals.\nDave Alvin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2nd guitar on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig Green TreeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\nBrett Simons ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Acoustic bass.\nDon Heffington ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Percussion.\nJoe Berardi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Percussion.\nBruce Zelesnik ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Percussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n  01.
