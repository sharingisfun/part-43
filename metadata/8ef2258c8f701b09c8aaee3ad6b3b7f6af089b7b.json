The record is full of boisterous, sarcastic and sometimes soulful singing and Zappa continues his ruthless public defacement of all things shallow, greedy and vacuous in modern society. Warning: your parents might not like some words on this album. If you're a devoted Zappa fan, these early-'80s recordings are a must-have.\n\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
