Though the band carried on after Morrison's drug-induced death in 1971, the Doors were at their creative peak from 1967 to 1969, when they released their first three records. This documentary offers a critical review of the Doors' recorded output during those legendary years through rare archival footage, interviews with critics and musicologists, and live performance clips.\n\nOrig Year \t2005\nDiscs \t1\nRelease Date \tJul 26, 2005\nRating \tNot Rated\nAlso Known As \tInside the Doors - 1967-1969\nRunning Time \t58 Minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4891dd2f6d785188e51344e008734c21e996a03","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Doors+-+A+Critical+Review+1967-1969.XviD.zecarlos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4891dd2f6d785188e51344e008734c21e996a03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,137,29,210,246,215,133,24,142,81,52,78,0,135,52,194,30,153,106,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
