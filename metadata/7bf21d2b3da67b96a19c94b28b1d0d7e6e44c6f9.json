With three adopted Asian kids--and a foundation to help others fund their own adoptions--Chapman finds plenty to celebrate and give thanks for and he does so in &quot;All I Really Want&quot; (told from a child's desire to belong to a loving family). It's the perfect subject for a song at Christmas, flanked by many familiar standards, a cameo from Vince Gill and 14 tracks all (including gospel readings and greetings from Chapman and one of his new daughters). The Christian music star has put the Word into action in his own life and it's that spirit that colors this special Christmas package. Give it to someone who's waiting to adopt one of the millions of children looking for a home this season. Speaking from experience, it will make the trial of waiting a lot easier.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, October 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf21d2b3da67b96a19c94b28b1d0d7e6e44c6f9","amp;dn":"Steven+Curtis+Chapman+-+2005+-+All+I+Really+Want+For+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf21d2b3da67b96a19c94b28b1d0d7e6e44c6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,242,29,43,61,166,123,150,161,156,148,178,139,29,13,126,110,68,198,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
