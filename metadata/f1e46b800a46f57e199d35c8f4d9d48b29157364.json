Logging?\nFishing? Tourism? Ever think to include marijuana? If you haven't, think again.\nNo longer a hobby for the stereotypical hippie culture of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢60s, BC's illegal\nmarijuana trade industry has evolved into a seemingly unstoppable business\ngiant, dubbed by those involved as 'The Union'. Commanding upwards of $7\nbillion Canadian annually, The UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s roots stretch far and wide, directly and\nindirectly affecting all areas of our society.
