Packed with political \ndouble dealing and sharp satire, Armando Iannucci's \nuniversally acclaimed series has won a host of awards \nincluding the comedy award at The South Bank Show Awards, \n2 Royal Television Society Awards, 2 Baftas and a \nNational Television Award.\n\nIn an attempt to look like he's doing something, the \nPrime Minister decides to reshuffle his cabinet. But \nno-one with any sense wants to join the Prime Minister \non the bridge as the ship appears to be going down. So \nhis chief enforcer Malcolm Tucker is having a hard job \nfinding ministers prepared to volunteer for suicide watch \nin the run up to the general election. Enter Nicola Murray \nMP: a woman so far down the list that Malcolm doesn't even \nhave a file on her but who can be flattered and bullied into \naccepting the Cabinet post that no-one wants: Secretary of \nState for Social Affairs and Citizenship.\n\nNicola's got plenty of ideas though: the Social Mobility \nAgenda, the Fourth Sector (whatever that is), but ideas \ncost money and in the current climate that means trouble. \nThis series follows Nicola and her used-up team of advisors \nas they struggle to achieve anything at all under Malcolm's \nwatchful eye. With Nicola's opposite number Peter Mannion \nand his team circling, they finally sense victory is within \ntheir grasp, even if they aren't too sure what to do with \nit when they get it.\n\nBeing in power is a good thing, right?\n\n[Clan]\n\nLookin fae: 100mbit+ eu affils, uk [ph]dtv cappers, retai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251d1794d49b2579a8cd82a56aca75e003b1f78f","amp;dn":"The.Thick.Of.It.S03E04.DVDRip.XviD-HAGGiS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251d1794d49b2579a8cd82a56aca75e003b1f78f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,29,23,148,212,155,37,121,168,205,130,165,106,202,117,224,3,177,247,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
