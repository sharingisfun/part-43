Using the history-altering effects of Crisis on Infinite Earths as an explanation, it was decided by DC editorial to give Superman an updated look and feel by completely rewriting his history, as an attempt to attract more readers. Thus, for modern comics, Man of Steel is the dividing point between the previous canon and the current one, usually known as &quot;pre-Crisis&quot; and &quot;post-Crisis&quot;.  The series was written and penciled by John Byrne and inked by Dick Giordano.\n\nThe Man of Steel retells SupermanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story beginning with his origin. Each issue focuses on a different time in the early years of his career. In telling the story, Byrne drew from all available media to have depicted Superman for inspiration.  The series reboots Superman continuity for a modern audience. Previous depictions of the comic book Superman and his mythology are discarded. Some charactersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ backgrounds were largely altered.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2004, this series was regarded as the &quot;official&quot; origin of Superman; in 2004, it was superseded by Superman: Birthright.  However, after the 2006 conclusion of the DCU-spanning event Infinite Crisis, the Birthright series' was removed in favor of a new origin story to be told in Superman: Secret Origin due for release on September 23, 2009.\n\nThe Man of Steel was followed by three four-issue mini-series that also retold and explored the rebooted world of Superman: The World of Krypton, The World of Smallville, and The World of Metropolis, all of them written by Byrne.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f2a9265c7a346295cf5c8b55d89614f5ace35d","amp;dn":"The+Man+of+Steel+%281986+Mini%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f2a9265c7a346295cf5c8b55d89614f5ace35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,242,169,38,92,122,52,98,149,207,92,139,85,216,150,20,245,172,227,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
