There is two audio streams in this file one is English, and I don't know what the other is, because I do not recognize the dialect. After Thomas goes off and the ending credits roll a cute little show called Roary the Racing Car comes on lasting about 10 mins. Never heard of this show but my nephew liked it so I left it in the file.\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a25e186d04bb299637fbe79943b1d9476b49e0","amp;dn":"Thomas+and+Friends+Team+Up+With+Thomas+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a25e186d04bb299637fbe79943b1d9476b49e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,162,94,24,109,4,187,41,150,55,251,231,153,67,177,217,71,107,73,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
