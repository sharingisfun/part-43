He takes them on an outing to the nearby caverns (a local attraction), but what happens there threatens to destroy any civility between the British and Indian societies.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India_(film)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Passage_to_India_(film)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9efee6d9707b182db07e56dafe43f2c7e76c23f","amp;dn":"E+M+Forster+-+A+Passage+to+India++%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9efee6d9707b182db07e56dafe43f2c7e76c23f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,239,238,109,151,7,177,130,219,7,229,109,175,228,63,44,126,118,194,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
