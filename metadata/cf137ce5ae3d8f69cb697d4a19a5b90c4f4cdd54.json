Taylor's many influences, interests, and obsessions are engaged here: They are mused upon, debated, and underscored for emphasis. His exploratory range has never been greater than it is on this three-part set, with two short and very delightful &quot;songs&quot; tagged on at the end. Taylor's sense of playfulness seldom comes through in his solo work, and this piece is full of it. Here is the place where the man truly lives as an artist... Of all the solo work Taylor did in the '80s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and there was plenty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this is the one to own. Go ahead. Be amazed&quot;.\n[edit]Track listing\n\nAll compositions by Cecil Taylor.\n&quot;Erzulie Maketh Scent Part 1&quot; - 33:15\n&quot;Erzulie Maketh Scent Part 2&quot; - 22:06\n&quot;Erzulie Maketh Scent Part 3&quot; - 16:46\n&quot;Water&quot; - 1:33\n&quot;Stone&quot; - 1:03\nRecorded in Berlin on July 16, 1988","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf137ce5ae3d8f69cb697d4a19a5b90c4f4cdd54","amp;dn":"Cecil+Taylor+-+1988+-+Erzulie+Maketh+Scent+%28log%2C+cue%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf137ce5ae3d8f69cb697d4a19a5b90c4f4cdd54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,19,124,229,174,61,143,105,203,105,125,74,25,165,185,12,79,76,221,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
