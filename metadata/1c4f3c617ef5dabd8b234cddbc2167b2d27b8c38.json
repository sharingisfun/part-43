He finds it shocking that professional scientists have never seriously examined this material. This book is about the hopes, experiences, and the frustrations of a scientist who has gone into the field to investigate a bizarre, seductive, and often terrifying phenomenon reported by many witnesses as a contact with an alien form of intelligence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4f3c617ef5dabd8b234cddbc2167b2d27b8c38","amp;dn":"Jacques+Vallee+-+Confrontations+-+UFO+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c4f3c617ef5dabd8b234cddbc2167b2d27b8c38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,79,60,97,126,245,218,189,139,35,76,221,188,33,103,178,210,123,140,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
