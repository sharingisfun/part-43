When her witchy boss breaks her leg, she uses her office (and her man) to make her move.\n\nA young secretary (Melanie Griffith in an Oscar-nominated performance) with dreams of moving up the corporate ladder thinks that her brains will help her achieve her goals. And when she finds a job with a seemingly helpful and sympathetic boss--who's also a woman (played by Sigourney Weaver)--it looks as if she's on her way. But it turns out the executive is slimy and duplicitous, stealing the secretary's clever ideas to further her own career. Now the furious secretary's determined to get revenge--and her plan may not only propel her to the top of the heap but get her a husband too (Harrison Ford). Mike Nichols directed this workplace comedy with a light, smart touch, getting terrific performances from his excellent cast.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2652e2b5c90f06462ddebf063f2e18778487e042","amp;dn":"Working+Girl+Dvdrip+H264+Bookerdog.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2652e2b5c90f06462ddebf063f2e18778487e042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,82,226,181,201,15,6,70,45,222,191,6,63,46,24,119,132,135,224,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
