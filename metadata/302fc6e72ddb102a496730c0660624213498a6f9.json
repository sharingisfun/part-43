Read the damned instructions in each directory before posting dumb questions !!!\n\n\nIncluded 3D Studio Max 2010 Plugins:\n\n Autodesk Mudbox 2010 64-bit (also stand-alone)\n Sitni Sati Afterburn 4.0b for Max 2010\n Sitni Sati Dreamscape 2.5e for Max 2010\n Sitni Sati Enlight 1.4 for Max 2010\n Sitni Sati FumeFX 1.2c for Max 2010 (yes finally - enjoy)\n Sitni Sati ScatterVL Pro 1.9 for Max 2010\n\nAgain, read the instructions for each, keygens are provided by X-FORCE, to whom I am in no way affiliated.  Gripe to them if it doesn't work.  If you like the software enough to use it all the time, and *especially* if you're profiting from it, buy a damned copy.  These guys put a lot of work into their software and it shows in the end results.\n\n\n\nA note to Sitni Sati: You guys make some awesome fluid dynamics simulators but there are no versions available in an affordable price range for casual users.  I, for one, would buy a copy of each if you offered a casual licensing option.  And apparently you need to work on your licensing mechanism, it looks like once you've cracked one, you've cracked them all :)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302fc6e72ddb102a496730c0660624213498a6f9","amp;dn":"Essential+Plugins+for+3DS+Max+2010+-+Mudbox+and+All+Sitni+Sati+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302fc6e72ddb102a496730c0660624213498a6f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,47,198,231,45,219,16,42,73,103,48,192,102,6,36,33,52,152,166,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
