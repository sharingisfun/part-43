They received eight gold and seven platinum records and the Band of the Year 1999 Emma award during their active career, which was during 1995ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ2003.\n\nThe band was formed in 1995 as a result of TV show &quot;Kiitorata&quot;. By the time both girls were only 16 years old. They started with backup tracks and dancers. Later their music matured somewhat and finally they performed fully live with a real band consisting of several professional musicians. Most of the music was composed by Risto Asikainen.\n\nOther artists have covered Nylon Beat's songs, most notably popular Korean pop group S.E.S.\n\nAlthough the duo nominally had already given their final concert on New Year's Eve 2003, they reformed again to perform as an opening band for two Toto gigs: the first was on August 17, 2007 in Oulu and the second on August 18, 2007 in Tampere.\n\n(Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nIncludes\n\n\nAlbums:\n\n* (1996) Nylon Beat\n* (1997) Satasen laina\n* (1998) Nylon Moon\n* (1999) Valehtelija\n* (2000) Demo\n* (2001) Extreme\n* (2002) Last in Line\n* (2003) 12 apinaa\n* (2004) HyvÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ uuttavuotta - Live\n\n\nSingles:\n\n* (1995) Oot kuin karkkia mulle\n* (1996) Teflon Love\n* (1996) Rakastuin mÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ looseriin\n* (1996) LÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤-lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤-lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\n* (1997) Satasen laina\n* (1997) Kuumalle hiekalle\n* (1997) Jos\n* (1998) Like a Fool\n* (1998) Umm ma ma\n* (1998) Viimeinen\n* (1999) Seksi vie ja taksi tuo / Liikaa\n* (1999) Ainut jonka sain\n* (1999) Musta joulu\n* (2000) Viha ja rakkaus\n* (2000) SyytÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¶n\n* (2000) Syntinen\n* (2001) Guilty\n* (2001) Anna mulle\n* (2002) Sanoja\n* (2002) Moka\n* (2002) Last in Line / Eternal Love\n* (2003) 12 apinaa\n* (2003) Petollinen pÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ivÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤kirja\n* (2003) Nukutaan\n* (2003) Kevytlinja / Psykedeliaa\n* (2004) Comeback\n* (2004) Kuumalle hiekalle - remix\n* (2004) Teflon Love - Live\n* (2007) Seksi vie 12 apinaa kuumalle hiekalle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f2cae6010e58ce941aa4cbf0c33abe6e9d5fa7d","amp;dn":"Nylon+Beat+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f2cae6010e58ce941aa4cbf0c33abe6e9d5fa7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,44,174,96,16,229,140,233,65,170,76,191,12,51,171,230,233,213,250,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
