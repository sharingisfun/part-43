The most talked about song is sure to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMetal Will Never DieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sung by Ronnie James, himself. The rest of the album does not break any molds but it sure as hell rocks hard enough to keep the horns in the air and the heads banging.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSmoke on the HorizonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ opens with a massive riff that sets the stage for the best tune on the album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEvil In Me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Other standout moments include the seedy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKill The DemonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGambler, Gambler.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s BoogieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the only time where one might think that the music does not match up to the rest of the album, as the main riff is simply ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLa GrangeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with a ton of distortion. That said, even it rocks.\n\nIn a time where ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MetalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tends to mean growling or just idiots pounding on their instruments, it is refreshing to see passion remain for the true roots of the genre.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec255b1701d81b987f5f4e68d0766baa8086db3a","amp;dn":"David+%5C%27Rock%5C%27+Feinstein+-+Bitten+By+The+Beast+%282010%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec255b1701d81b987f5f4e68d0766baa8086db3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,37,91,23,1,216,27,152,127,95,78,104,208,118,107,170,128,134,219,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
