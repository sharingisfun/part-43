Fugitive ex-con Dom Toretto (Diesel) is back in Los Angeles to seek out the truth behind a high-profile crime, but his presence in town doesn't sit well with Agent Brian O'Conner (Walker). These two rivals are forced to unite in the cause of fighting a common enemy, however, when convoy heists and precision tunnel crawls lead them out of Los Angeles and into the Mexican desert. Now, in order to take down a formidable opponent with some serious skills behind the wheel, Dom and Brian forge an uncertain partnership while exploring thrilling new frontiers in the fine art of racing. Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, and John Ortiz co-star. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 47 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b265b23ed895bd3eaa9006c4253647a8f06c311b","amp;dn":"Fast+and+Furious%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b265b23ed895bd3eaa9006c4253647a8f06c311b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,101,178,62,216,149,189,62,170,144,6,196,37,54,71,168,240,108,49,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
