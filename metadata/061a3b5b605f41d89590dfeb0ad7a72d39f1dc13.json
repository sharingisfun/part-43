I am a die hard Apple mail fan, but the way that Sparrow handles gmail and threading is something you just have to see. This app utilizes the new design thinking that we are seeing in the best new OS X applications. The interface is similar to programs like Twitter and Reeder and I wouldn't have it any other way. At least give this app a try, I haven't regreted switching. They are constantly improving the app and the developers are very responsive to requests and concerns.\n\nRequirements: Mac OS X 10.6 or later\n\nInstallation:\nJust drag and drop the Sparrow Application into your Application folder. Enjoy and please buy the app if you like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061a3b5b605f41d89590dfeb0ad7a72d39f1dc13","amp;dn":"Sparrow+for+MAC+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061a3b5b605f41d89590dfeb0ad7a72d39f1dc13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,26,59,91,96,95,65,216,149,144,223,235,10,215,167,45,57,241,220,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
