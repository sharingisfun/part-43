Somewhere along the line the band ousted their lead singer Al and went as a 3-piece.  This didn't work to well and I think they had a few reunion shows with Al but just kind of died away.\n\nIncluded here along with the album in MP3 format are scans of the cd, back cover and inlay with all lyrics.\n\nMy 2nd torrent.  Hope a few people enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88012d2bf3a2121c17de301c9d924686360a875f","amp;dn":"drool+self+titled+album+-+alternative%2Fhard+rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88012d2bf3a2121c17de301c9d924686360a875f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,1,45,43,243,162,18,28,23,222,48,28,157,146,70,134,54,10,135,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
