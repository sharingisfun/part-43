New Yorker correspondent Mayer (Strange Justice) details the battle within the Bush Administration over a new anti-terrorism policy of harsh interrogations, indefinite detentions without due process, extraordinary renditions, secret CIA prisons and warrantless wiretappings. Fighting with memos and legal briefs, Mayer reports, hard-liners led by Dick Cheney, his aide David Addingtion and then-Justice Department lawyer John Yoo rejected any constraints on the treatment of prisoners or limitations on presidential power in fighting terrorism, while less militant administration lawyers invoked the Constitution and international law to oppose their initiatives. As a counterpoint to the wrangling over the definition of torture and the Geneva Conventions, the author looks at the use of techniques like waterboarding, stress positions, sleep deprivation and sexual humiliation against prisoners by the American military and CIA; her chilling account compellingly argues that this &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; regimen constitutes torture. The result is a must-read: a meticulous behind-the-scenes reconstruction of policymaking that demonstrates how legal abstractions became an ugly reality.\n\n\n\nReview\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeeply troubling, but splendidly executed....

To dismiss these as wild, anti-American ravings will not do. They are facts, which Mayer substantiates in persuasive detail, citing the testimony not of noted liberals like Noam Chomsky or Keith Olbermann but of military officers, intelligence professionals, &quot;hard-line law-and-order stalwarts in the criminal justice system&quot; and impeccably con...\n\n\n    * Print Length: 432 pages\n    * Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0307456293\n    * Publisher: Anchor; Reprint edition (May 8, 2009)\n    * Sold by: Random House \n    * Language: English\n    * ASIN: B001NLKYEC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fbfa93c1072a247979e60383a084fb6462d7b0","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Side%3A+The+Inside+Story+of+How+The+War+on+Terror+Turned+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fbfa93c1072a247979e60383a084fb6462d7b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,251,250,147,193,7,42,36,121,121,230,3,131,160,132,251,100,98,215,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
