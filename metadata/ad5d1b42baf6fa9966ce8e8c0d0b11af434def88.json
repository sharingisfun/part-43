The Prophet's Companions represent excellent examples of men of vigorous moral stature whose conduct inspired and attracted the masses to the fold of Islam wherever they went during the expansion of the Muslim territories, and contrary to the stereotypic portrayal, in the West, of Islam as being spread by the sword.\n\nThe Prophet's words are as relevant today as they were fourteen hundred years ago. This unique collection of 1,322 ahadith and athar is one of the earliest and most authentic works on Islamic etiquette and the Islamic way of life. Not only are they practical and inspiring, they also fulfill a desperate need for an authoritative guide on morality and spirituality for Muslims living in a modern, secular society, where the line between right and wrong is increasingly blurred.\n\nThis book is an essential cornerstone of Islamic morality and is suitable for the general reader and the academic alike. Its author, Imam Bukhari (194-256 AH/810-70 CE) is the most celebrated figure in Islamic literary history. Al-Adab al-Mufrad is an absolutely essential addition to every Islamic library.\n\n\n\n  \nTopics\nI. Parents  \nII. Ties of Kinship  \nIII. Mawlas  \nIV. Looking After Girls  \nV.
