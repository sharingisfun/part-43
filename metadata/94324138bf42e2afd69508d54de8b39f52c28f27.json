He continued writing and performing as Plenti while Interpol's fame grew, but Plenti took a sabbatical around 2003. In 2006, Banks revived the Plenti work when he began experimenting with the recording software Logic Pro and demoed new and old songs. In 2008, Banks recorded final versions of the Plenti songs with string and brass sections, as well as friends like Interpol drummer Sam Fogarino, Ratatat's Mike Stroud, Stiff Jesus' Striker Manley, and the Occasion's Charles Burst. The results, Julian Plenti Is Skyscraper.\n\nTracks\n\t\t\n1 Only If You Run\t \t\n2 Fun That We Have\t \n3 Skyscraper\t \n4 Games for Days\n5 Madrid Song\t \n6 No Chance of Survival\t\n7 Unwind\t\n8 Girl on the Sporting News\t \n9 On the Esplanade\t \n10 Fly as You Might\t \n11 H\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94324138bf42e2afd69508d54de8b39f52c28f27","amp;dn":"Julian+Plenti+Is...+Skyscraper+%28Paul+Banks+from+Interpol%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94324138bf42e2afd69508d54de8b39f52c28f27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,50,65,56,191,66,226,175,214,149,8,213,77,232,179,159,82,194,143,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
