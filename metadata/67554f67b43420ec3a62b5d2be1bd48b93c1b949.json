It was developed by Ubisoft Quebec exclusively for the Wii. The game features a completely different storyline and setting from other versions, as well as gameplay mechanics, as the game makes use of the Wii's motion control as well as conventional buttons. While other versions of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands feature powers such as water or time manipulation to aid the player, the Wii version has its own unique set of powers: It features a &quot;Sand ring,&quot; which serves as a grip which the player can deploy in certain areas on walls; a &quot;Sand pillar,&quot; which acts like an elevator the player can deploy in certain places on the ground; and a &quot;Sand bubble,&quot; which the player can deploy in midair to act a safety net, breaking the player's fall and suspending them there.\n\nThe Wii version of the game also features local multiplayer, in which a second player can aid the first player by freezing on-screen enemies or traps for them, or helping to unlock secret areas. Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands for the Wii also features some bonus content, such as unlockable in-game character skins, art galleries, developer diaries, bonus levels, and the original 1992 version of Prince of Persia. The game received generally favorable reviews, having received a 78/100 at reviewer aggregate Metacritic, and it is popularly referred to as having last generation graphics and dull combat, but was generally praised for its unique and creative gameplay mechanics.\n\n\nMinimum requirements:\n=====================\n\nOperating System: Microsoft Windows (2000/XP/Vista/7) / Linux / Apple Mac OS X (Intel version)\nCPU: Pentium 4 or Athlon 64 with SSE2 (recommended: a dual core processor above 2 GHz)\nGPU: OpenGL 2.1 or DirectX 9.0c compatible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           ***** enjoy ... *****\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67554f67b43420ec3a62b5d2be1bd48b93c1b949","amp;dn":"Wii+4+PC+%C3%82%C2%BB+PRINCE+OF+PERSIA+-+THE+FORGOTTEN+SANDS+with+emulator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67554f67b43420ec3a62b5d2be1bd48b93c1b949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,85,79,103,180,52,32,236,58,98,181,210,190,27,212,139,147,193,185,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
