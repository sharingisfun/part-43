The title cut is right up there with songs like &quot;One Room Country Shack&quot; and &quot;A Man and His Blues&quot;. In addition to composing a more jazzed up version of &quot;My Time After Awhile&quot; Guy also manages to put a unique and enjoyable spin on the Muddy Waters classic &quot;I'm Ready&quot;. Another standout is &quot;You Don't Love Me&quot; a smooth soul-blues cut reminiscent of the Chess years.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Watermelon Man 5:18 \n2 Hold That Plane 4:43 \n3 I'm Ready  5:04 \n4 My Time After Awhile  7:44 \n5 You Don't Love Me  4:17 \n6 Come See About Me  8:40 \n7 Hello San Francisco  5:24\n\nPersonnel includes:\n\nBuddy Guy (vocals, guitar);\nPhil Miles (guitar); \nA.C.
