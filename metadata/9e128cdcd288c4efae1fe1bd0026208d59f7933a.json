The band is currently composed of Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, Ed Robertson, and Tyler Stewart. Barenaked Ladies formed in 1988 in Scarborough, Ontario, then a suburban city outside Toronto.[1] They are best known for their hit singles, &quot;One Week&quot;, &quot;The Old Apartment&quot;, &quot;Pinch Me&quot;, &quot;If I Had $1000000, and &quot;Brian Wilson&quot;;[1] they have won multiple Juno Awards and been nominated for Grammy Awards. They are also known for their light-hearted, comedic performance style. The band's trademarks at live shows are humorous banter between songs and improvised raps/songs, both of which are staples at virtually every concert.[2] Original keyboardist Andy Creeggan left the band in 1995, and founding member Steven Page departed in 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in Good Time 2010\n\n\nAll In Good Time is the ninth and most recent full-length original-material studio album by Barenaked Ladies (the eighth, if Barenaked Ladies Are Me and Are Men are considered as one double-album). All In Good time was released on March 23, 2010 in Canada,[2] and March 30, 2010 in the United States.[1][3][4]. It is the first album recorded following the departure of founding member Steven Page in February 2009, and the band's second album recorded as a four-piece (their 1996 album Born on a Pirate Ship was recorded between the departure of original keyboardist Andy Creeggan and his replacement by Kevin Hearn). &quot;You Run Away&quot; was the first single released from the album.[3] &quot;Every Subway Car&quot; was released on US and Canadian iTunes on February 23 both as a preview track if the album is pre-ordered, and as a stand-alone purchase.\n\nThe band came to the table with 27 written songs, with 18 making the cut to be recorded. With Page's departure, Hearn and bassist Jim Creeggan have filled the void by contributing a comparatively greater share of lead vocals than on previous albums.[5] Ed Robertson, who had contributed lead vocals approximately equally with Page, sings lead on 10 of the 18 recorded songs, while Hearn and Creeggan sing on five and three respectively.\n\nAfter founding member Steven Page announced his departure from Barenaked Ladies to pursue a solo career, the band posted a message on their website indicating that the remaining members would continue recording and touring together as Barenaked Ladies and would enter the studio in April.[6]\n\nThe band began recording the new album with producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda on May 19, 2009, and documented their rehearsal and recording process through their Twitter account.[7] Primary recording was done at Canterbury Studios in Toronto, with additional recording done at Jim Creeggan's home. Recording ended on July 24, and Bob Clearmountain finished mixing the 18 recorded tracks on July 30.[8][9] The final album consisting of 13 songs (later changed to 14) was sequenced and mastered on August 13.[10] In August, Robertson indicated the possibility of releasing an EP composed of the songs that did not make the cut for the final album.[11]\n\nThe band announced on January 6, 2010 that it had signed an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with EMI Label Services through its new label Raisin' Records, which replaces its previous label, Desperation Records, used from its break with Reprise Records in 2004 until the departure of Page in 2009.\n\n\nSo far, the album has received mostly positive feedback. It has got mostly stellar reviews[17][18], though some fans claim the band is not the same without co-founder of the band, Steven Page.\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;You Run Away&quot;  \n2.\t&quot;Summertime&quot;  \n3.\t&quot;Another Heartbreak&quot;  \n4.\t&quot;Four Seconds&quot;  \n5.\t&quot;On The Lookout&quot;  \n6.\t&quot;Ordinary&quot;  \n7.\t&quot;I Have Learned&quot;  \n8.\t&quot;Every Subway Car&quot;  \n9.\t&quot;Jerome&quot;  \n10.\t&quot;How Long&quot;  \n11.\t&quot;Golden Boy&quot;  \n12.\t&quot;I Saw It&quot;  \n13.\t&quot;The Love We're In&quot;  \n14.\t&quot;Watching The Northern Lights&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e128cdcd288c4efae1fe1bd0026208d59f7933a","amp;dn":"Barenaked+Ladies+-+All+In+Good+Time+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e128cdcd288c4efae1fe1bd0026208d59f7933a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,18,140,220,210,136,196,239,174,31,225,189,0,38,32,141,89,247,147,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
