His first thrust into the international spotlight was as a finalist to be Rob Halford's replacement in Judas Priest. Having created a buzz at the auditions, he found himself with offers to sing for many European and American bands. He selected Royal Hunt after much deliberation and officially joined the band on December 26, 1994.[1]\n\nAfter 4 years with Royal Hunt, Cooper left the band for his next project, a solo album that he began in 1998. Enlisting the help of musicians from many well known bands (among them guitarist Tore Ostby of Conception, and members of Pink Cream 69) he released D. C. Cooper in 1999.\n\nAfter a successful tour, Cooper formed a new band with former Sinner guitarist Alex Beyrodt called Silent Force. The have released four studio albums of their own.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f10f5d8547c137fd7f68cf0a5ce1fe5daca379","amp;dn":"D.C.+Cooper+-+D.C.+Cooper+%281999%29+%5Bmp3%40320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f10f5d8547c137fd7f68cf0a5ce1fe5daca379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,241,15,93,133,71,193,55,253,127,104,207,10,92,225,254,93,172,163,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
