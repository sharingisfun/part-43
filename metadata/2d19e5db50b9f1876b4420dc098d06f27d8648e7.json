Remember, if you like, buy!\n\n\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\n======================\n\nExpanDrive adds SFTP and SSH file capabilties to Windows Explorer by mounting SFTP servers as Windows drives.\n\nAccess remote files within any application\n\nExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your PC. Open, edit, and save files on remote computers from within your favorite programsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even when they are on a server half a world away. ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.\n\nAdd SFTP to Explorer\n\nWith ExpanDrive, you can securely access any remote file server directly from Explorer, or even the command line. No need to open a separate SFTP client just for file transfer. ExpanDrive extends the way all applications on your PC can access data.\n\nReconnect with grace\n\nOnce youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re connected, you stay connected. If you change access points or bring your computer out of sleep, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll stay connected. Our robust networking core ensures that if a connection is available, your drive is available.\n\nRidiculously Simple ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it just works\n\nOur client is dead simpleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½there is nothing to install or configure on the server. No complicated instructions. No administrative hassles. Just use your existing login credentials to securely access your remote files.\n\t\t\n\nCHANGES\n==========\n\nThe most important new features for this release is that Strongspace [our upcoming online storage service] users are automatically licensed when they connect to their Strongspace account using ExpanDrive. In addition quite a variety of small bugs surrounding some installation quirks and Windows 7 problems have been fixed.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d19e5db50b9f1876b4420dc098d06f27d8648e7","amp;dn":"ExpanDrive+for+Windows+v1.8.4b1%2BPatch+%5Bjaymac407%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d19e5db50b9f1876b4420dc098d06f27d8648e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,25,229,219,80,185,241,135,107,68,32,220,9,141,6,242,125,134,72,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
