Both were in Helicopter Project prior to its break up though no music from this group was ever released. Afterwards the pair decided to continue to make music together. They subsequently completed three albums in six months. Ben Cooper is also a member of Radical Face (Formerly known as Radical Face Versus Phalex Sledgehammer), Iron Orchestra, and Mother's Basement. The Electric President tracks and most of Ben Coopers projects are recorded in a tool shed in back of his house that he has converted into a sort of recording studio.\n\n\n\nElectric President's first release was a pseudo-eponymous album (named &quot;Self-Titled&quot; rather than &quot;Electric President&quot;) in early 2006. They gained limited mainstream notoriety after their music was featured on Fox Network's hit show The OC. At the end of the thirteenth episode of season three, titled &quot;The Pot Stirrer&quot;, the song &quot;Insomnia&quot; is prominently featured in the closing sequence.\n\nThe self-titled debut album was released on German electronica label Morr Music. Electric President's mix of glitch electronica and indie songwriting has been compared to The Postal Service, Styrofoam and Anticon's cLOUDDEAD.\n\nThe new record named Sleep Well was released June 9, 2008 for Europe and June 24, 2008 for the US. In Mid-April 2008, the album leaked on file-sharing networks.\n\nOftentimes, their singing and musical stylings are compared with the indie-pop band The Weakerthans.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - The Ocean Floor 5:03\n02 - Mr. Gone 3:05\n03 - Safe And Sound 4:07\n04 - Feathers 3:23\n05 - Nightmare No. 5 Or 6 5:47\n06 - The Violent Blue 4:14\n07 - Circles 4:12\n08 - Elegant Disasters 4:30\n09 - Eat Shit And Die 3:09\n10 - All the Distant Ships 8:38\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_President&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_President&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Violent_Blue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Violent_Blue&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radicalface.com/electricpresident.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radicalface.com/electricpresident.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; AS ALWAYS: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfe5789f6d8b36fc96446cdb70120cc532b509e","amp;dn":"Electric+President+-+The+Violent+Blue+%282010%29%28Indie+Electronic+Po","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfe5789f6d8b36fc96446cdb70120cc532b509e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,254,87,137,246,216,179,111,201,100,70,205,183,1,32,204,83,43,80,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
