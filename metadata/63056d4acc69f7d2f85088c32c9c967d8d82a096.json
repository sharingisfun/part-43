This dvd contains six episodes, each covering a different type of engine - the imperial steam engine, the workhorse diesel, the exhilarating supercharger, the laid back v8, the noisy, smelly two-stroke, and the jet, the engine that went on to shrink the world. This is the highly-acclaimed channel 4 television series - a celebration of design, engineering and individual genius. If you want to see a man single-handedly remove the engine from a trabant, or toast marshmallows in the afterburner of a military jet aircraft, then this is the film for you - the guardian. I have a confession to make says robbie coltrane. I am a nosey bastard. I am incapable of walking past a piece of machinery without wanting to know all the details of its private life.\n\nPart 2. The Workhorse Diesel\nRobbie Coltrane turns his attention to the diesel engine, known as the workhorse of the world. He charts the story of the maverick inventor, Rudolf Diesel, who was driven to commit suicide by his creation and, through visits to a Cornish lighthouse, an apple farm in Oregon and a disco in Zimbabwe, he examines the rise of this economical hard-working engine.\n\nIMDB Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130393/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBFI Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/28949&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 23 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 6\nPart Size: 336 MB\nSource: DVDRip\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63056d4acc69f7d2f85088c32c9c967d8d82a096","amp;dn":"Coltranes+Planes+and+Automobiles+2of6+Xvid+AC3+MVGroup+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63056d4acc69f7d2f85088c32c9c967d8d82a096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,5,109,74,204,105,247,210,248,80,136,195,44,156,150,125,141,130,160,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
