They record their first album titled Family Life, that it circulates the summertime 2005 from Vacant Records. The album is characterized by itsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ low profile, acoustic sound and the voice of Evira. It takes dithyrambic reviews from the printed and electronic press and the group intensifies their live appearances in many Greek cities.\n  They started to work their new songs on summertime 2006 and two years after the release of their acclaimed debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFamily LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Abbie Gale are back with their second album, symbolically titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The music style of the band changes perceptibly, the sound becomes more electric and the rhythm most intense, without losing the melody that characterizes them. Guided by the charming, wide-ranging voice of Evira, the band appear more mature than ever, as they present their compositions in a solid and determined fashion. The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excellent production values, combined with Abbie GaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s confident playing, make ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ an exciting listening proposition.\n  Starting with the introspective mood of the opening track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLife After LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Abbie Gale guide us through a bright playful conversation in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLovesongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (guest featuring Raining PleasureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frontman Vassilikos), sparks of lyricism such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œClownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAirÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and an agonizing spoken-word manifesto in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDankoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dedication to their creative vision, along with their refined sense of songwriting and their honest inspiration make for an aesthetically flawless result.\n\n  Abbie GaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is also the debut release of the new and upcoming indie label Inner Ear.    \n\nAbbie Gale are:\n\nEvira: Voice\nSalvatore: Guitar, bass VI\nPedal: Guitar, keyboards\nAchilles: drums, loops\nNick: bass\n\nFor more info check:\nthe band's website      - http://www.abbiegale.gr/home.html\nthe last.fm entry       - http://www.last.fm/music/Abbie+Gale\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThis torrent contains:\n\n-----&gt; LPs &lt;-----\n\n2007 - 2\nTracklist:\n01 Life after Life  \t   \t \n02 Lovesong \t  \t \n03 Heliotrope Portrait \t  \t \n04 Clown \t  \t \n05 Wanted \t  \t \n06 Gone \t  \t \n07 Contact Improvisation \t  \t \n08 Over The Wall \t  \t \n09 Sometimes \t  \t \n10 Air \t  \t \n11 Goodnight \t  \t \n12 Danko\n\n\n2005 - Family Life\nTracklist:\n01 Letters (family life)  \t   \t \n02 Mom \t  \t \n03 Say the words \t  \t \n04 The end song \t  \t \n05 Kid still lives \t  \t \n06 Spring \t  \t \n07 P.S. \t  \t \n08 Secrets \t  \t \n09 Harmonica \t  \t \n10 The Sky\n\n-----&gt; EPs &lt;-----\n\n2008 - Fall\nTracklist:\n01 Fall  \t   \t \n02 Mom 2008\n\n\nIf you like this band, please support it by attending its gigs or even better buying its cds :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cfaea428ab4f88660130c16e360d8e5902c6cf7","amp;dn":"Abbie+Gale+%28Full+Discography%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cfaea428ab4f88660130c16e360d8e5902c6cf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,250,234,66,138,180,248,134,96,19,12,22,227,96,216,229,144,44,108,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
