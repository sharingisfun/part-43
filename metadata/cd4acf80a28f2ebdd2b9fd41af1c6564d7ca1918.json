The Official Fiction is musically a        |\n|   natural progression from 2001.s release, Echolalia, seeing the band        |\n|   produce a record comprised mostly of accessible rock.n.roll songs, with    |\n|   the band expanding the simple formula by experimenting with additional     |\n|   instruments to expand their three-piece sound (some songs on the record    |\n|   see the band performing with as many as eight pieces). There is a          |\n|   consistent depth of harmony on this album that for better or worse sets    |\n|   this apart from the band.s previous releases, and is the result of both    |\n|   the expanded instrumentation present on many of the songs, as well as a    |\n|   product of carefully layered vocal harmonies (many of them multitracked    |\n|   by singer/guitarist Paul Dempsey, ranging from simple harmony lines to     |\n|   singing counter-melodies across his own vocals) alongside the presence     |\n|   of three acclaimed vocalists as guests; Lisa Germano, Caitlin Cary of      |\n|   Whiskeytown, and Grant Lee Phillips of Grant Lee Buffalo. Fans of the      |\n|   band will notice an immense shift in sound between this release and        |\n|   earlier efforts such as 1997.s Elsewhere For Eight Minutes.                |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Stylistically, the shift away from guitar oriented songs and toward more   |\n|   cohesively orchestrated compositions places the focus of this record on    |\n|   layered harmonies. While the vocals of Paul Dempsey have always been in    |\n|   the spotlight, this shift in musical emphasis means that the album         |\n|   highlights them more than ever, and as a vocalist this record is           |\n|   arguably the best work of his career. Paul.s strong voice is often a hit   |\n|   or miss affair for listeners of the band due to its unique sound and       |\n|   texture, though as this album demonstrates, there is no question of his    |\n|   pitch, control, and ear for harmony.                                       |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The two songs featuring Lisa Germano (Light At The End Of The Tunnel and   |\n|   Reverse Soundtrack) are the least densely orchestrated of the album,       |\n|   with violin and cello being the only additional instruments. The slowest   |\n|   paced songs on the disc, these tracks leave the vocals prominent and       |\n|   isolated over subtle musical backgrounds, with the instrumental parts      |\n|   panned and arranged to create subtle soundscapes rather than the strong    |\n|   progressions heard on the majority of the other tracks, which are          |\n|   typically moderately paced rock.n.roll songs such as the country-rock      |\n|   influenced single Moving Right Along, and the more driving rock song       |\n|   Asleep At The Wheel, which sees the band performing in their more          |\n|   familiar three-piece setting, throwing the focus back on Paul.s guitar     |\n|   work and the absence of guest vocalists leaving him to perform his own     |\n|   harmonies (particularly notable in the bridge). Fans who preferred the     |\n|   sound of Echolalia will most likely gravitate to this track, while songs   |\n|   such as Souvenir provide a happy medium between the more fully             |\n|   orchestrated songs and the driving three-piece rock sound, keeping an      |\n|   upbeat, guitar driven feel while tastefully arranged violin and cello      |\n|   tracks provide subtle colouration.                                         |\n|                                                                              |\n|   The majority of songs in the albums fit inbetween the two ends of the      |\n|   spectrum described above, typically being moderately paced,                |\n|   conventionally structured rock songs featuring the band.s usual guitar,    |\n|   bass and drums with the addition of keyboard and occasional strings to     |\n|   thicken the harmonies and add depth and density to the songs. This style   |\n|   is well represented in the three other singles released from the album,    |\n|   DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ja VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº, Song For A Sleepwalker and Best Weapon. The first single from     |\n|   the album, DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ja VÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âº is a definite stand-out track, fitting a great deal     |\n|   of dynamic variation and musical content into the form of a radio          |\n|   compatabile rock song. This track builds to be, along with                 |\n|   Kaplan/Thornhill, one of the most densely orchestrated songs on the        |\n|   album, seeing the band effectively perform as an eight-piece when joined   |\n|   by four-piece string ensemble The Section. Lyrically, the album is         |\n|   consistent with the Paul.s previous work, giving his own individual        |\n|   observations and impressions of things, whether they are introspective     |\n|   or social in nature. The album features three tracks; Best Weapon,         |\n|   Letter To The Editor and No Man.s Land that are very reflective of the     |\n|   social environment at the time the album was written. No Man.s Land is     |\n|   of special note because it features the great guest vocals of Grant Lee    |\n|   Phillips, whose voice works very well with Dempsey.s, adding a little      |\n|   extra to the album closer, which sees the band finish the record with      |\n|   another more stripped back rock.n.roll song, fading out over a jam outro   |\n|   that recalls the outro to Twenty Years from their previous album.          |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Overall, the album is a well written and well produced collection of       |\n|   melodic rock.n.roll songs. The record doesn.t have quite the same level    |\n|   of variety in song styles as previous efforts such as Echolalia, though    |\n|   a level of diversity is maintained instead through a good deal of          |\n|   dynamic variation in the songs as well as through the presence of the      |\n|   guest vocalists and string players. The production on the album deserves   |\n|   special mention, as the often densely layered sounds are carefully         |\n|   arranged, especially when it comes to the many guitar overdubs and         |\n|   multi-tracked vocal harmonies present on a number of the songs. The        |\n|   Official Fiction was recorded in Mangrove Studios in Sydney, with          |\n|   production by Trina Shoemaker. The Section were recorded at Quiet Street   |\n|   Studios in Los Angeles, with additional recording at Sunset Studios.       |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n       +------------+\n+------+ Track List +----------------------------------------------------------+\n|      +------------+                                                          |\n|   No. | Title                                                  | Duration    |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|   001 | Max Planck ........................................... | 00h05m41s   |\n|   002 | Best Weapon .......................................... | 00h05m47s   |\n|   003 | Song for a Sleepwalker ............................... | 00h04m54s   |\n|   004 | Kaplan / Thornhill ................................... | 00h05m44s   |\n|   005 | Light at the End of the Tunnel ....................... | 00h04m36s   |\n|   006 | Editor ............................................... | 00h04m31s   |\n|   007 | Deja Vu .............................................. | 00h04m26s   |\n|   008 | Reverse Soundtrack ................................... | 00h05m41s   |\n|   009 | Coldwater Canyon ..................................... | 00h04m23s   |\n|   010 | Souvenir ............................................. | 00h03m24s   |\n|   011 | Moving Right Along ................................... | 00h03m27s   |\n|   012 | Asleep at the Wheel .................................. | 00h04m55s   |\n|   013 | No Man.s Land ........................................ | 00h04m17s   |\n|   ----+--------------------------------------------------------+----------   |\n|                                                                              |\n|   Total Length ____________ 00h54m46s                                        |\n|                                                                              |\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n       +-----------+\n+------+ Audio Rip +-----------------------------------------------------------+\n|      +-----------+                                                           |\n|   Ripped with _____________ ExactAudioCopy v0.99pb5 [exactaudiocopy.de]      |\n|   Encoded with ____________ LAME v3.98.4 [lame.sourceforge.net]              |\n|   Encoding Stats __________ -V2 / 44.1kHz / VBR / 16-bit / J.
