He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche's influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.\n\nThus Spake Zarathustra is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œeternal recurrence of the sameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the parable on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeath of GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œprophecyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe deepest ever writtenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.\n\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840649250dc01f221c9ec52480c438cbc64cdaa5","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+Audiobook+-+Thus+Spake+Zarathustra+by+Friedrich+Nie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840649250dc01f221c9ec52480c438cbc64cdaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,6,73,37,13,192,31,34,28,158,197,36,128,196,56,203,198,76,218,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
