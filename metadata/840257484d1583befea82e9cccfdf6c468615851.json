The Boston-based quintet found the middle ground between the menace of the Rolling Stones and the campy, sleazy flamboyance of the New York Dolls, developing a lean, dirty riff-oriented boogie that was loose and swinging and as hard as a diamond.\n\nIn the meantime, they developed a prototype for power ballads with &quot;Dream On,&quot; a piano ballad that was orchestrated with strings and distorted guitars. Aerosmith's ability to pull off both ballads and rock &amp; roll made them extremely popular during the mid-'70s, when they had a string of gold and platinum albums. By the early '80s, the group's audience had declined as the band fell prey to drug and alcohol abuse. However, their career was far from over -- in the late '80s, Aerosmith pulled off one of the most remarkable comebacks in rock history, returning to the top of the charts with a group of albums that equalled, if not surpassed, the popularity of their '70s albums.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tFlac Conversion\n\nJoe Perry returned to the fold in 1985, and Aerosmith turned out their finest record since Rocks. Unlike the records that preceded it, Done with Mirrors is powered by the same smart-assed lyrics and filthy guitars that formed the core of Aerosmith's best songs. It didn't receive the commercial or critical attention that Permanent Vacation did two years later, but Done With Mirrors is the better album; it marks the beginning of their remarkable comeback.\n\n01.Let The Music Do The Talking\n02.My Fist Your Face\n03.Shame On You\n04.The Reason A Dog\n05.Shela\n06.Gypsy Boots\n07.She's On Fire\n08.The Hop\n09.Darkness\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840257484d1583befea82e9cccfdf6c468615851","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Done+With+Mirrors+%2ARemaster%2A+%281985%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840257484d1583befea82e9cccfdf6c468615851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,2,87,72,77,21,131,190,254,168,46,156,204,253,246,196,104,97,88,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
