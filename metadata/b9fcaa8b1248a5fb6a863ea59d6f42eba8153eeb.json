Given the \ntour's enthusiastic reception, McCartney could wait until 1993 to deliver the \nalbum's proper sequel, Off the Ground. Though it isn't as consciously ambitious, \nOff the Ground certainly picks up where Flowers left off, as McCartney feels no \nshame in making an album that doesn't aim for the charts (though success would \ncertainly be welcomed), yet is still classy, professional, and ambitious. Two \nkey differences appear: It's a leaner production (making the mid-tempo numbers \nseem less cloying and giving the rockers real kick), and McCartney's social \nconscience dominates the record (which is easily his most politically active, as \nhe rails against animal testing and pleads for world peace several times). He \ndoesn't leave love or whimsy behind (&quot;Biker Like an Icon&quot; is easily his worst, \nmost studied stab at whimsy), and he still has a pair of fine McCartney/McManus \nsongs (&quot;Mistress and Maid,&quot; &quot;The Lovers That Never Were&quot;) to pull out. This all \nresults in a record that has its virtues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it's clean and direct, where many of \nhis solo albums are diffuse and meandering, and it's serious-minded where many \nrely on cutesiness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but, overall, Off the Ground feels like less than the sum \nof its parts, possibly because the seriousness is too studied, perhaps because \nthe approach is a bit too stodgy. Nevertheless, this has nearly as many \nsuccessful moments as Flowers in the Dirt, standing as a deliberately serious \ncomeback record by an artist who spent too much time relying on his natural \ncharm, and who feels no shame in overcompensating at this stage of the game. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          SOME WIKIPEDIA INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecording and structure\n\nWhen the sessions for the album began in the fall of 1991, McCartney decided to \nuse his current touring band as session musicians, most of whom had already \nappeared on Flowers In The Dirt.  In addition, his collaboration with Elvis \nCostello was rekindled with both &quot;Mistress And Maid&quot; and &quot;The Lovers That Never \nWere&quot; emerging from their songwriting sessions and reserved for this album. \nUnlike Flowers In The Dirt, however, Costello would not appear on Off the \nGround.\n\nOne of the main differences between Flowers In The Dirt and Off The Ground is \nthe leaner, more direct sound. With the musicians sounding less studied than \nthey had on the previous release, Off The Ground has a relaxed, natural feel by \ncomparison. Another change is McCartney's increased interest in social issues, \nbe it the scathing anti-animal cruelty rocker &quot;Looking For Changes&quot; (McCartney \nand his wife Linda long-time vegetarians by this time) or paeans for a better \nworld (&quot;Hope Of Deliverance&quot; and &quot;C'Mon People&quot;).\n\nRelease\n\n&quot;Hope Of Deliverance&quot; was chosen as the lead single, being released in the last \nweek of December 1992 and the album following in February 1993. While Off The \nGround hit #5 in the UK and reached #17 in the US, and eventually went gold, it \nalso has the distinction of being the first Paul McCartney album to not contain \na sizeable US hit single since Wings' Wild Life in 1971. While &quot;Hope of \nDeliverance&quot; floundered there, it managed to reach #18 in the UK, where &quot;C'Mon \nPeople&quot; would become a minor hit as well. Worldwide positions for the album were \ngenerally good, but that was mainly because Off the Ground was released during \nthe very poorly competitive post-Christmas season. As a matter of fact, the \nalbum spent only 6 weeks inside the Top 100 in the UK, even reaching #5 there. \nIn Germany, the album was particularly successful, with &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot; \nreaching #3 on the singles charts and the album spending 4 weeks at #2.\n\nSome weeks following the album's release, McCartney launched &quot;The New World \nTour&quot;, taking in many successful shows across the globe during the summer \nmonths. These gigs would be documented on the album Paul Is Live, which follow \nat the end of 1993.\n\nAlthough generally considered a slightly weaker successor to Flowers In The Dirt \nand now somewhat overlooked, Off The Ground is prized by many McCartney \nfollowers.\n\nThe feet on the album cover are actually of McCartney, his wife Linda and his \ntouring band.\n\n&quot;C'Mon People&quot; is followed by a hidden excerpt of an unlisted song called \n&quot;Cosmically Conscious&quot;, originally written by McCartney in 1968 during The \nBeatles' transcendental meditation retreat in India\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nxact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9fcaa8b1248a5fb6a863ea59d6f42eba8153eeb","amp;dn":"Paul+McCartney+-+Off+The+Ground+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9fcaa8b1248a5fb6a863ea59d6f42eba8153eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,252,170,139,18,72,165,251,106,134,62,165,157,111,66,235,168,21,62,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
