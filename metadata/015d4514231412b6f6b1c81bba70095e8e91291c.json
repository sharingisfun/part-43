New songs by\nGreen Go, Kasabian, Simian Mobile Disco, Apostle of Hustle, Eels, Rural\nAlberta Advantage... and many more! Leaked songs by Friendly Fires and\nArctic Monkeys... and, well, that's it. But it' cool to listen to tracks\nthat no one was ever supposed to hear, isn't it? I hope everyone's summer\n(or winter, haha Australia) is still going well. Only 30 tracks on this\none, but it took me extra long to compile for some reason, hence being\nlate by a day. Woops. Cheers and enjoy!\n________________________________________________________________________\n\ncut the crap playlists: a fresh batch of genre- and border-crossing\ntracks every month. good music, for free, monthly. it doesn't have to be\nnew; it just has to be good! please support artists you like by\npurchasing music and attending concerts =)\n\nfind out about new ctc playlists first at the ONLY official ctc website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mindset.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nplease note: in case of a repack, the pirate bay and mininova are the\nONLY websites i will update torrent descriptions of. they are the only\nwebsites i manually upload playlists to. however, my playlists are\nuploaded automatically to many others, completely out of my control.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n                          Tracklisting:\n                          `````````````\n        * = NEW!
