After a few concerts the band parted ways with their singer. END. continued working on their musical expression which became even more obscure, epileptic and oppressiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nIn early 2004 and after many auditions, the band finally found a suitable vocalist, soon heading back out on the road to play with the likes of Gojira, JenX, Sybreed, Black Bomb A, Pelican, Sleepers and High On Fire, among others.\n\nAt the beginning of 2005 END. entered ConKrete Studio in Bordeaux to record the EP Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Never Ending Whirl Of Confusion Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â». The title &quot;Beyond The Senses&quot; was chosen to be part of the June 2005 Rock Hard sampler. Critics are unanimous as far as the musical quality of the band is concerned. END., which in a live setting feels like being crushed by a steamroller, continued spreading their name.\n\nIn the summer of 2006 they joined Jerkov Booking Agency and in December they appeared on a compilation among bands like Dagoba, Manimal and Punish Yourself.\n\nThe Metal Academy of the national radio Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« Le Mouv' Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» put END. on the air quite regularly and named it Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« album of the week Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» during 2006.\n\nBefore going to the studio in August 2007 to record their first album, END. took part in Hellfest (Neurosis, Machine Head, Slayer...) on the Discover Stage in June.The band was also seen on local television news M6 Toulouse for this great event.\n\nFrance's END. gives the metal scene exactly what is needed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ something unique, groundbreaking, and a new style of extreme to follow upon. Much like fellow homeland heroes Gojira and Hollow Corp., END. pulls off a signature sound that can immediately be picked up by the metal critics. END.'s ever evolving brand of extreme music makes for an open minded listen from start to finish. Their technicality not only stands out, but also goes towards metal's advantage, expanding the genre.\n\nEND. delivers complex and brutal structures while at the same time adding doses of dark and apocalyptic moods, keeping you addicted. Their creativity, power, and aesthetics without a doubt will stun the metal genre.\n\nCurrent lineup\nMathieu : Vocals\nFranck : Guitar,backing vocals\nYann : Guitar\nJulien : Drums\nMika : Bass\n\nGenre = Sludge / Math Metal\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = 320 kbps\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
