This is direct evidence that was used against the Nazis during the Nuremburg Trials. Very rare, and almost impossible to find on the web. This is completely uncensored rarely any video cutting. The only narration is what the Allies Chief Commander narrating the conditions while showing it around. The quality is average, but what can you expect? This was shot by army camera men in 1944 and was never digitally mastered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee36497f6a6920580e4ad767c9ad0e8169e4d59","amp;dn":"Original+Nazi+Concentration+Camp+Video+Uncensored+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee36497f6a6920580e4ad767c9ad0e8169e4d59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,227,100,151,246,166,146,5,128,228,173,118,124,154,208,232,22,158,77,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
