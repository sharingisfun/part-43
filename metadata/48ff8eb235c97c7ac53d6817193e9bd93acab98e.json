More than a decade after the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government has released tens of thousands of murderers back into the communities they ravaged. Survivors and perpetrators have had to learn to live again as neighbors.Inspired by the award-winning film As We Forgive, this book explores the pain, the mystery, and the hope through seven compelling stories as victims, orphans, widows, and perpetrators journey toward reconciliation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48ff8eb235c97c7ac53d6817193e9bd93acab98e","amp;dn":"As+We+Forgive+-+Stories+of+Reconciliation+from+Rwanda+%282009%29+%28Ma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48ff8eb235c97c7ac53d6817193e9bd93acab98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,255,142,178,53,201,124,122,197,61,104,23,25,62,155,217,58,202,185,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
