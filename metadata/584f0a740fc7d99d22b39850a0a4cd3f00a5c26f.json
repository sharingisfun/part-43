Most of the material was written (or co-written) by Walker except for the Nick Gravenites classic &quot;Born in Chicago.&quot; Walker works with a stripped-down lineup consisting of Robert Watson on bass, Geno Blacknell Jr. on keyboards, and Willy Jordan on drums. This is a mainly up-tempo disc with lots of Walker's slide guitar which is especially strong on &quot;Slow Down GTO,&quot; &quot;Borrowed Time,&quot; and &quot;Slide Her Up and Down&quot; (a silly title but, you get the drift). Without a doubt, the two strongest moments are the final two tracks. &quot;My Judgment Day&quot; is a gritty solo vehicle for Walker and slide, and &quot;Eight Years of Loving&quot; features Walker on harp and Blacknell playing boogie woogie-style piano. ~ Al Campbell\n\nTracklist\n1.
