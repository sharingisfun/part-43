An allied force advances along a war-torn beach in a strange land, outnumbered and far from home. Together, they fight the greatest evil they have ever known. Never ending waves of exotic enemies come crashing down on them, but they will not rest. Thousands of miles away, the world is on the brink of destruction. But here in a child's bedroom in Brooklyn, our heroes, a small group of toys loyal to their human master, fight an unseen war to save him from every child's worst nightmare.\n\nLed by the toy soldier known as the Colonel and the boy's faithful teddy-bear named Max, the toys enter the realm known as The Dark. There they will face off against the Boogeyman and his army-- a legion of the boy's forgotten, bitter toys. Fighting to survive insurmountable odds, the toys will discover this is a battle not only for the soul of a child, but for their own as well...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f183122c75098b4c400518c059174787f71b16","amp;dn":"The+Stuff+of+Legend+01+%28of+02%29+%282009%29+%28c2c%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f183122c75098b4c400518c059174787f71b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,241,131,18,44,117,9,139,76,64,5,24,192,89,23,71,135,247,27,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
