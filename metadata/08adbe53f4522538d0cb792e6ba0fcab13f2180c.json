Many people were surprised to hear how rock-minded much of Destiny is, but then, Khan's former band Rufus had major rock leanings in the beginning: 1973's Rufus and 1974's Rags to Rufus underscored Khan and Rufus' appreciation of Ike &amp; Tina Turner's soul/rock and were hardly the work of R&amp;B purists. Nor is Destiny; while some of the material is straight R&amp;B (including &quot;Tight Fit&quot; and the exuberant single &quot;Love of a Lifetime&quot;), Khan successfully combines R&amp;B and rock elements on &quot;My Destiny&quot; and &quot;Who's It Gonna Be&quot; (which Janice Marie Johnson of A Taste of Honey fame had recorded on a little-known solo album in 1984). And some of the tunes are really more pop/rock than R&amp;B, including &quot;Watching the World,&quot; &quot;The Other Side of the World,&quot; and &quot;So Close.&quot; As much as Destiny has going for it, the LP isn't without its shortcomings. &quot;Who's It Gonna Be&quot; would have been better off without the fake applause that producers Arif and Joe Mardin pointlessly added, and the post-bop jazz offering &quot;Coltrane Dreams&quot; (which features saxman Sam Rivers) is too brief for its own good. Rivers, a major talent, doesn't get a chance to stretch out, and the piece ends up sounding undeveloped, which is quite frustrating because Khan can be a great jazz singer when she puts her mind to it. But while Destiny isn't perfect, the album has many more pluses than minuses and is easily recommended to both R&amp;B and pop/rock enthusiasts.&quot;\n\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n\nDestiny\n=======\n01.
