(E-BOOK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I find most interesting is that NASA and these news outlets actually feel\nthey need to debunk non-believers. The truth is, if this were a real event, they\nwouldn't even need to entertain the thoughts of those who refuse to believe. I\nmean, if it's assumed to be real by the masses, why bother? When someone\nputs so much effort into convincing you that a lie is the truth, but fails to ever\nprovide tangible proof; most intelligent people will be naturally inclined\ntowards disbelief. People who speak the truth, and know what they are saying\nis fact, usually completely refuse to answer absurd accusations, and why\nshould they? Facts are not something to debate.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8992b14d1087cd84161d11e96139f60c4fba217","amp;dn":"NASA+Releases+Definitive+Proof+of+Moon+Landing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8992b14d1087cd84161d11e96139f60c4fba217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,153,43,20,209,8,124,216,65,97,209,30,150,19,159,96,196,251,162,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
