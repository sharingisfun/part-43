Most algorithmic \n   reverbs  offer  a  number of  different  algorithms  to simulate  different \n   natural rooms like chamber, halls or artificial ones like plates.   REFLECT \n   uses  impulse  responses from  real  acoustic spaces  and  classical reverb \n   algorithms to emulate their acoustical properties. \n             \n   The resulting  reverberation sets  new standards  in clarity  and sense  of \n   space !   \n             \n             \n   Surround  \n             \n             \n   The new version is  a true  surround  reverb  modelling multichannel  early \n   reflections  and  decorrelated  reverb   tails  for  a  realistic   spatial \n   emulation. \n             \n   REFLECT  is  now compatible  to  the new  VST3  standard -  the  next major \n   revision of Steinbergs Virtual Studio Technology. The VST3 version  allows \n   for arbitrary input/output channel configurations up to 10.2 Surround. \n             \n   Features: \n             \n   - True Surround reverb \n     VST3: all configurations up to 12 channels including 5.1 / 7.1 \n     AudioUnit: mono/stereo/5.1 =&gt; mono/stereo/5.1 \n     RTAS: mono/stereo/5.1/7.1 =&gt; mono/stereo/5.1/7.1 \n             \n   - Import of surround impulse responses. \n   - Surround reverb programs. \n\n\n                                                          \n                         \n                                   \n                  \n                                        \n                  1) Unzip, Unrar and run Setup.exe \n                            \n                  2) Enjoy this fine Team AiR release !!! \n\n\n                       \n                                      \n               \n                                                    nFO bY ThE AiRBEARS 2009  \n\n   Unfortunately the vst2 and vst3 version of this plugin can't co-exist in C5\n   In this plugin the vst3 version takes priority over the vst2 version\n   delete the vst3 version from c:program filescommon filesVST3\n   restart Cubase 5 and the vst2 version will appear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1c56472ff87dd4619ff909bde41b72d77f82c1b","amp;dn":"VirSyn.Reflect.VST.RTAS.v2.0.0-AiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1c56472ff87dd4619ff909bde41b72d77f82c1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,197,100,114,255,135,221,70,25,255,144,155,222,65,183,45,119,248,44,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
