Elaborate, distinctive camera movements at moments of high dramatic tension tend to displace acting technique in the representation of psychological states. Used only in conjunction with the two main women characters, Namiko (Takamine Mieko) and her daughter Shinako (Okada Mariko), the camera movements now seem to detract from the emotional weight of the drama. From the failure of this film, we can glimpse something of the change in the aesthetics of realism implicit in the representation of the democratic self of postwar Japan.&quot; Catherine Russell.\n\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Dancing Girl (1951, Mikio Naruse).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,566,615,552 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:25:05\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 720x544 (AR: 1.324)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2318 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.247 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n\nNOT MY RIP.
