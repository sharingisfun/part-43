He has lectured on mathematics and musical theater. Lehrer is best known for the pithy, humorous songs he recorded in the 1950s and 60s.\n\n\nBefore attending college, Lehrer graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut. As an undergraduate student at Harvard University, he began to write comic songs to entertain his friends, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFight Fiercely, HarvardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (1945). Influenced mainly by musical theater, his style consisted of parodying then-current forms of popular song. For example, his appreciation of list songs led him to set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of Gilbert and SullivanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMajor-GeneralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s SongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nInspired by the success of his performances of his songs, he paid for some studio time to record an album, Songs By Tom Lehrer, which he sold by mail order. Self-published and unpromoted, the album, which included the macabre (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Hold Your Hand In MineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), the mildly risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBe PreparedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and the mathematical (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLobachevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), became a success via word of mouth. With a cult hit, he embarked on a series of concert tours and released a second album, which came in two versions: the songs were the same but More Songs by Tom Lehrer was studio-recorded, while An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer was recorded live in concert. \n\n_________________________________________Tracks__________________________________\n\n\n\n1-Poisoning Pigeons In The Park                2:49  \n2-Bright College Days                          3:13   \n3-A Christmas Carol                            3:05    \n4-The Elements                                 2:18    \n5-Oedipus Rex                                  3:52    \n6-In Old Mexico                                6:45   \n7-Clementine                                   4:52   \n8-It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier      5:05    \n9-She's My Girl                                3:01  \n10-The Masochism Tango                         3:42    \n11-We Will All Go Together When We Go          5:45 \n12-I Wanna Go Back To Dixie                    2:56    \n13-The Wild West Is Where I Want to Be         2:31    \n14-The Old Dope Peddler                        1:42 \n15-Fight Fiercely, Harvard                     2:52  \n16-Lobachevsky                                 4:19 \n17-The Irish Ballad                            5:14 \n18-The Hunting Song                            1:59    \n19-My Home Town                                2:58\n20-When You Are Old And Grey                   2:27\n21-The Wiener Schnitzel Waltz                  2:21   \n22-I Hold Your Hand In Mine                    1:55 \n23-Be Prepared                                 2:37  \n\n\n________________________________________Track Info_______________________________\n\n\n                                     AAC Audio Files\n                                     256 Kbps (VBR)\n\n\n\n________________________________________XxxxENDxxxxX_____________________________\n\n\n                                Please Seed -&gt; Sharing is Caring\n\n\n\n                          [ CONSTRUCTIVE comments are appreciated ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO: ALBUM ARTWORK WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT THE TIME OF UPLOAD.
