Starting in 2001 as a 2 man indie-metal wrecking crew, Mico de Noche has\ncontinually refined its version of modern heavy music. Now, with 3 previous\nreleases and multiple shows and tours under their collective belt, the duo of\nDon Stewart &amp; Mike Clam welcome fellow veteran of a thousand psychic\nwars, Chad Baker, into the fold on the electric bass guitar and bring you the\ngroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most killer set of awesome jams yet.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCherriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ began in the summer of 2006 with two goals in mind: 1) get\nsludgier and more fucked up than ever and 2) bring in as many like-minded\nfriends as possible to play on the songs. One year later, the result is seven\ntracks of premium grade, full-tilt, northwest freakrock, featuring guest\nappearances by members of Black Elk, Lozen, Argonaut, Source of Labor,\n...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, and several other wasted\nrocker friends of the band. During the process of producing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCherriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the\nband pushed the limits of what could be done with a guitar, drums, some\nwicked acid flashbacks, and the uncontrollable urge to rock. The songs of\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCherriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ grind and lurch through 28 sick and depraved minutes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ fans of the\nloud and heavy, take note!\n\nIn 2003, MdN was named one of the top 10 metal bands by the Seattle\nWeekly, whatever thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worth. Over the past six years, the band has played\nextensively throughout the Northwest and West coast opening for such\nacts as High on Fire, Jucifer, Big Business, The Blood Brothers, Kinski,\nC-Average, Chrome, and Totimoshi . Live highlights include invitations to\nappear at Wantage Records Totalfest four times from 2003-2006 as well\nas playing showcases at SXSW in 2004 and 2005. Currently they are in the\nmiddle of production on their next CD and are planning shows/tours for the\nupcoming year.\n\nCurrent line-up \nDonovan Stewart - Vocals, Drums (Migas, Helltrout)\nChad Baker - Bass\nMichael Crum - Vocals, Guitar (A.M.Q.A., Helltrout)\n\nFormat = Mp3\nBit Rate = Vbr\n\nTrack Listing\n1.
