Escape\n\nAlice Cooper ( born Vincent Damon Furnier; February 4, 1948 ) is an American rock singer, songwriter and musician whose career spans more than four decades. With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors and baby dolls, Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and violent brand of heavy metal that was designed to shock.\n\nWelcome to My Nightmare is a concept album  released in 1975.The songs, heard in sequence, form a journey through the nightmares of a child named Steven. This was Alice Cooper's first solo album (all previous Alice Cooper releases were band efforts). The cover artwork was created by Drew Struzan. Rolling Stone would later rank it as one of the &quot;Top 100 Album Covers Of All Time&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Abrasax/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b468f732e8a4cb1373f66070bcd492f856bb7898","amp;dn":"Alice+Cooper+-+Welcome+To+My+Nightmare+-+Flac+-+Abrasax","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b468f732e8a4cb1373f66070bcd492f856bb7898","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,104,247,50,232,164,203,19,115,246,96,112,188,212,146,248,86,187,120,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
