The first sounds of &quot;Delta&quot; prove that it was well worth the wait. As unrelenting masters of their craft, the band delivers a how-to of symphonic metal and refines their sound without losing their hard-earned identity. Once again, Visions of Atlantis uses heavy guitars and driving drums to build the foundation upon which to showcase sonorous orchestral melodies and sweeping vocal lines. Whether romantic ballads such as &quot;Reflection&quot; or catchy hits like &quot;New Dawn&quot; and &quot;Elegy of Existence&quot;, Maxi Nil is able to prove her talents as a first-class vocalist. The supporting role of Mario Plank's aggressive vocal accents places a finishing and unique touch to the tracks. Dreamscape Studios (Serenity, Edenbridge) provided for an immaculate production, which not only emphasizes the power of the songs, but also allows the fine details to shine through. &quot;Delta&quot; presents Visions of Atlantis at its best and is an impressive symbiosis of sonorous power and unadulterated emotion.\n\nArtist: Visions Of Atlantis\nAlbum: Delta\nYear: 2011\nGenre: Metal\nBitrate: VBR 192-320 kbps\nFormat: MP3\nTracks: 10\nSize: 66 MiB\n\nTracklist:\n1.
