Records. The title is an allusion to the Vietnam War and baby boomers. It features many relative newcomers to the P-Funk mob, many of whom would remain employed by George Clinton on future releases under his own name or under the name George Clinton &amp; the P-Funk All-Stars. Sly Stone is a collaborator on this album. Clinton originally planned on this being a double album, but the idea was quashed by Warner Brothers. Some of the deleted tracks would appear on future P-Funk releases, most notably the 1983 hit single &quot;Atomic Dog&quot; which appeared on the first George Clinton solo album. This was Funkadelic's best album of the later years and a must have for fans\n\n1. &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot; (Bob Bishop, George Clinton, Walter Morrison) (Released as a single - Warner Bros. 49667)\n2. &quot;Electro-Cuties&quot; (J.
