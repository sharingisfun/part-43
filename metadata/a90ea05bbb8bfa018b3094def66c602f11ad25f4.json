It was a showcase for the advanced multimedia capabilities available on personal computers at the time. It will run on all of Microsoft's operating systems released since Windows 95, including Windows 7. The game is a combination of bumper cars and capture the flag.\n \nHover! Is supposedly freely available on the Microsoft FTP download site, but the link to it on the Wiki appears to be broken. So, I dug out my old Win95 CD and copied the complete full version of the game for your pleasure.
