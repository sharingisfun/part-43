Not only was is great to hear those two songs again, but every single song on this albumn are FAB! Not only are Mr. Lynch's songs extremely funny, they are also well-written and the lyrics are very clever. If he wasn't a comedian, I'm sure he'd have a successful career as a rock star! He has that star quality about him- super good looks, witty sense of humor and he knows how to really rock on the guitar!\nI like this cd better than his first release primarily because is was recorded live and he has a wonderful rapport with audiences, an element that was sorely missing from his first CD &quot;A Little Bit Special.&quot; (But, don't put that you off buying it because it also is very fun and entertaining!) Not a lot of comics can talk with people in the audience and work the conversation into their routines. Stephen Lynch does this so naturally! Especially in the song &quot;Superhero,&quot; where some members of the crowd come up with their own superheros, with some pretty freaky results!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a21f42fd0a6b9a685b48f6b66b2e43db914fc51d","amp;dn":"Stephen+Lynch+-+Superhero-3+BALLOONS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a21f42fd0a6b9a685b48f6b66b2e43db914fc51d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,31,66,253,10,107,154,104,91,72,246,182,107,46,67,219,145,79,197,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
