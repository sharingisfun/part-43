Taylor\nSpringer\n1995\n284 pages\n\n\n**********************\n\nThis book teaches humanities majors the accessibility and beauty of discrete and deductive mathematics. It assumes no prior knowledge of either college-level mathematics or political science, and could be offered at the freshman or sophomore level. The book devotes one chapter each to a model of escalation, game-theoretic models of international conflict, political power, and social choice. The material progresses in level of difficulty as the book progresses. The author is a recognized expert in applying ideas in modern mathematics to problems in international conflict resolution. Intended for non-specialists and requiring only introductory mathematics, the quantitative methods are presented in strongly applied settings for political science and the social sciences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f3071a5f0f3147afc3e222b0bba9b3c5c1892ff","amp;dn":"Mathematics+and+Politics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f3071a5f0f3147afc3e222b0bba9b3c5c1892ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,48,113,165,240,243,20,122,252,62,34,43,11,186,155,60,92,24,146,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
