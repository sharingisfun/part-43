'\n'================================================================================='\n' Steps For Downloading:                                                          '\n'================================================================================='\n' 1. First of all, you MUST need a torrenter , I suggest uTorrent for efficiency  '\n'    and fast downloads.                                                          '\n'================================================================================='\n' 2. Next, obviously (lol), download the torrent.                                 '\n'================================================================================='\n' 3. After you finish the web browser styled download, your torrenter will pop    '\n'    up asking you if you would like to download this file. Click ok.             '\n'================================================================================='\n' 4. After it is finished torrenting (downloading), go to your downloads folder,  '\n'    this is normally where your torrented files will go. A .rar file will show   '\n'    up. Click on it.                                                             '\n'================================================================================='\n' 5. In this .rar file, there will be a folder called Angry Birds. Extract that to'\n'    your program files folder.                                                   '\n'================================================================================='\n' 6. Now, go to that same Angry Birds folder that you just extracted to your      '\n'    program files. Open up that folder and right click on the application        '\n'    &quot;Angry Birds&quot; and click on send to, then desktop.                            '\n'================================================================================='\n' 7. Now, go to your desktop and click on the icon you just sent to your desktop. '\n'================================================================================='\n' 8. SEED SEED SEED!!! Don't delete the files from both the downloads folder or   '\n'    your torrenter.
