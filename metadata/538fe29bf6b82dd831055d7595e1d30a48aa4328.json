Previously managed by his bitter rival Don Revie (Colm Meaney), and on the back of their most successful period ever as a football club, Leeds had an aggressive and cynical style of football - an anathema to the principled yet flamboyant Brian Clough, who had achieved astonishing success as manager of Hartlepool and Derby County building teams in his own vision with trusty lieutenant Peter Taylor. Taking the Leeds job without Taylor by his side, with a changing room full of Don's boys, would lead to an unheralded examination of Clough's belligerence and brilliance over 44 days. This is that story. The story of The Damned United.\n\nThe Damned United is a 2009 British sports drama film directed by Tom Hooper and adapted by Peter Morgan from David Peace's bestselling novel The Damned Utd a largely fictional book based on the authors interpretation of Brian Clough's tenure as manager of Leeds United.\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadGgAACd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NadGgAACd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naDgiaaCd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naDgiaaCd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naDgJAacD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/naDgJAacD&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538fe29bf6b82dd831055d7595e1d30a48aa4328","amp;dn":"The.Damned.United.2009.Workprint.XviD.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538fe29bf6b82dd831055d7595e1d30a48aa4328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,143,226,155,246,184,45,216,49,5,93,117,149,225,211,10,72,170,67,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
