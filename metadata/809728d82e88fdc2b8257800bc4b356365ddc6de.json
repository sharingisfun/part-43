And this documentary does in fact support that theory. However, the selectiveness of the subjects leaves much to be desired. Hindsight, as they say, is 20/20 - and in the case of the people responsible for this documentary - it's also very selective. There's absolutely no mention of the post-Mick Jones Clash that existed from 1983-1986. Four years of a bands history is an awful lot of time to simply not feel like mentioning. Sure the album this band produced (1985's Cut The Cr*p) may not have been on par with say London Calling but few albums are. To completely fail to not mention it makes me wonder why the filmmakers would simply choose to re-write history as if it never existed. All this does is support the fact that documentaries edit history any way they want. The unmentioned band (Simonon/Stummer/Pete Howard/Vince White/Nick Sheppard) toured the US in 1984 and also did a busking tour of England in 1985. By not mentioning them at all does no favors for any new young fan who actually wants to know about The Clash's history.\n\n\nDon't be a leecher,SEED! ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:809728d82e88fdc2b8257800bc4b356365ddc6de","amp;dn":"The+Clash%3A+Westway+to+the+World+%26+The+Clash+on+Broadway","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"809728d82e88fdc2b8257800bc4b356365ddc6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,151,40,216,46,136,253,194,184,37,120,0,188,75,53,99,101,221,198,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
