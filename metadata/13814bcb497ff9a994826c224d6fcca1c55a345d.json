Often described as a film version of Peter B. Kyne's Three Godfathers (which Ford would direct in 1948), Three Bad Men is actually based on Over the Border, a novel by Herman Whitaker. The plot, which spans several years, is set in motion when three bandits appoint themselves protectors of the heroine, whose settler father is killed early in the proceedings. A subplot involves bandit Tom Santschi's efforts to wreak vengeance on the man who seduced and abandoned his sister. The film was originally supposed to star George O'Brien, Tom Mix and Buck Jones as the title characters, but since the plot required the Three Bad Men to be killed off long before the fadeout, and since all three proposed stars had large and loyal kiddie followings, the roles were recast, with character actors Santschi, Frank Campeau and J. Farrell McDonald. O'Brien was retained, albeit relegated to a less colorful heroic role. Three Bad Men should be seen in its original release form; most commercial prints are chopped up and woefully washed out. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : 3 bad men.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.07 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 668 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate : 1 582 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.215\n      Stream size : 1.02 GiB (95%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 32mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 73.6 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 96.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 48.5 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 250 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5 --abr 96\n      \nIMDB: tt0017463\n\nSilent movie with English intertitles; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13814bcb497ff9a994826c224d6fcca1c55a345d","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+3+bad+men+%5B1926%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13814bcb497ff9a994826c224d6fcca1c55a345d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,129,75,203,73,127,249,169,148,130,108,34,77,111,204,161,197,90,52,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
