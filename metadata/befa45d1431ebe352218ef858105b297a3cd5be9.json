In fact, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think she particularly wants to.  She has a niche, and interests far deeper than just being a rich entertainer and keeping the gossip magazines fed.. \nHowever, as with the majority of pop/rock acts of the modern era, there's nothing all that musically groundbreaking that would make Albertine stick out from the rest of the pack. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/22/brooke-fraser/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:befa45d1431ebe352218ef858105b297a3cd5be9","amp;dn":"Brooke+Fraser...Albertine%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"befa45d1431ebe352218ef858105b297a3cd5be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,250,69,209,67,30,190,53,34,24,239,133,129,5,178,151,163,205,91,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
