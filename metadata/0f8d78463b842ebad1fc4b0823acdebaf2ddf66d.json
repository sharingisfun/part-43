Rejected and never officially released, it's supposed to be\nThe score James Horner created but was rejected for Walter Hill's Streets Of \nFire.  It's only one track, with no separations, and a drums sound taken from \nthe first track that can be heard both on the CD and the actual movie, &quot;Nowhere \nFast&quot;, as the only recognizable link with the movie.\n\nI haven't found many references to this score through Internet, hence this very \nshort introduction text.  From http://www.runmovies.eu/, I found this text \ninside an article about the soundtrack for Star Trek III:\n\n&quot;Another recent assignment was in composing a score to Walter HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s STREETS OF \nFIRE. HornerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, however, was subsequently rejected in favor of a rock \nscore by Ry Cooder and serves as an example of HornerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s problems with free \nreign. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe score that I wrote for STREETS OF FIRE was a very percussive, \npropulsive score. It used a lot of different, varied, exotic instrumentation. \nThey decided to take that feeling out. They wanted something a little more \ntraditional and they went with 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rock and roll.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Horner attributes the \ndifficulty with the score as the result of his willingness to experiment. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI \ntried something very risky in STREETS OF FIRE. I thought it worked terrifically \nand so did everybody, actually. But after about a week of living with it, \nthinking about it, the director started to feel I perhaps had gone too far. Now \nthereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a difference between perhaps going too far and reverting back to 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \nrock and roll!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nEnjoy it as it is, a curiosity.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.

It's normal, after a few hours/days downloading and \nexpecting a release, to feel deceived if it doesn't work properly, and \nexpressing this is legitimate.\n\nI've often found one comment (negative) on a movie/CD downloaded by 2000+ \npeople, and since that single negative feedback, people simply stop downloading \nand therefore, sharing.  But a few times it was due not to the torrent itself, \nbut to some issues on the downloader side (not updated codecs, misused \ntools...), and that's unfair for the person who took the time to share it for\nfree.\n\nIF YOU FIND THIS RELEASE DESERVES TO BE RECOMMENDED TO OTHERS, HELP BY DROPPING \nA LINE AFTER YOU'VE CHECKED IT.  This way, You'll help in keeping the torrent \nalive, almost as much as keeping it in your HDD until a 1:1 ratio is\nreached.\n\nThanks\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8d78463b842ebad1fc4b0823acdebaf2ddf66d","amp;dn":"James+Horner+-+Streets+of+Fire+%28Rejected+Score%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f8d78463b842ebad1fc4b0823acdebaf2ddf66d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,141,120,70,59,132,46,186,209,252,75,8,35,172,222,186,242,221,246,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
